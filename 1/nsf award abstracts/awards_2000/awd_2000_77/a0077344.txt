Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Chemistry Department at Princeton University will upgrade their
              high resolution electron microscope.  This equipment will facilitate research
              in the following areas:  a) the application of structural analysis by electron
              diffraction of nanometer-size crystals of transition metal oxides; b) the use
              of electron diffraction to determine the structure of beam sensitive
              biochemical compounds important in photosynthesis; and c) the use of exit wave
              reconstructions from through focus high resolution electron microscopic images
              to determine atomic arrangements with a much higher accuracy.  

This
              equipment will have a significant impact on cutting-edge research projects
              across a wide range of disciplines at Princeton, including materials chemistry
              and biochemistry.  In addition, the equipment will make the instrument more
              user-friendly, so that it will be more accessible to students.  The PI will
              introduce a new course in structure determination using high resolution
              transmission electron microscopy.
