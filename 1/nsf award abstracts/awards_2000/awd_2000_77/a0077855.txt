Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa
              will acquire a nanosecond transient absorption spectrometer.  Research will
              focus on photoinduced electron transfer studies, including a) measurement of
              electron transfer rates in redox-gradient dendrimers; b) use of fast
              spectroscopy to understand the phylloquinone cofactor in Photosystem I; and c)
              investigations of photochemistry in novel chromophores for optical data
              storage.  

Transient absorption spectroscopy is an extremely versatile tool
              that can be used to probe fundamental photophysical and photochemical
              processes.  These studies will have an impact in a number of areas including
              materials science and biochemistry.
