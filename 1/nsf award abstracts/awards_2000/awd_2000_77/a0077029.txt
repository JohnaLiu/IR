Abstract    :
              Symposium FF entitled "Interfaces, Adhesion and Processing in Polymer Systems",
              is being organized by the Materials Research Society (MRS) in San Francisco
              from April 24-28th as part of their 2000 Spring MRS Meeting.  This symposium is
              being organized by Professors Spiros Anastasiadis (Foundation for Research and
              Technology, Greece) and Gregory Ferguson (LeHigh University), and Dr. Alamgir
              Karim (Polymers Division, NIST).  The purpose is to hold an international
              meeting attended by leading polymer scientists in the area of polymer
              interfaces, adhesion and processing.  The choice of the symposium topic derives
              from recent demands placed upon polymer performance that have paralleled the
              growth in applications and driven the development of sophisticated
              multiconstituent polymer formulations with superior physical, mechanical and
              interfacial properties.  The symposium aims at addressing both the fundamental
              scientific aspects and the advances in applications of polymers at interfaces
              and in processing.  To bring new ideas to these topics, the meeting will have a
              more multidiciplinary nature by having joint sessions with two other
              symposiums, "Interfacial Aspects of Soft Biomaterials", and "Nanostructures in
              Polymers".  Biomaterials and biological interfaces are expected to play a key
              role in promising areas of biotechnology for the future.  Likewise, recent
              interest in nanomaterials is driven by opportunities for improving material
              properties.  Processing and interfacial aspects are expected to be important
              for both of these areas and hence the proposed joint sessions.
