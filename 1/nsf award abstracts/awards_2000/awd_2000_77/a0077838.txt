Abstract    :
              Plants and fungi synthesize short peptides termed phytochelatins when exposed to
              heavy metals such as cadmium.  Phytochelatins are derived from a tripeptide,
              glutathione, by the transfer of peptide units from one glutathione molecule to
              another.  The gene encoding for the enzyme that synthesizes phytochelatins,
              named phytochelatin synthase, has recently been cloned.  The main objectives of
              the research program are three-fold:  (i) To define the basic enzymology of
              phytochelatin synthase. (ii) Elucidation of the catalytic defect in mutants
              expressing variant forms of phytochelatin synthase.   (iii) Crystallization and
              three-dimensional structure determination of phytochelatin synthase.  These
              studies will yield fresh insights into transpeptidation reactions, in general,
              and the mechanism of phytochelatin synthesis, in particular.  The genes
              encoding phytochelatin synthase could also be used to engineer plants for the
              remediation of heavy metal pollution.
