Abstract    :
              This award, jointly funded by the Divisions of Chemistry and Chemical and
              Transport Systems, renews support to the Board on Chemical Sciences and
              Technology of the National Academy of Sciences for the Chemical Sciences
              Roundtable. The Roundtable provides a forum for the leadership of the chemical
              sciences from universities, industry and government to discuss research,
              education and economic issues of great current concern to the chemical
              community. The Roundtable serves as means to exchange information among the
              chemical sciences leadership and through them to disseminate this information
              broadly within that community. It also organizes and sponsors workshops on
              topics of critical current importance to the chemical sciences making the
              proceedings of these workshops widely available to that community as well. It
              does not make recommendations or provide advice. As a neutral, credible forum
              managed by the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology of the National
              Academy of Sciences the Roundtable facilitates communication among all
              stakeholders in the chemical enterprise.
