Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the occurrence of Equatorial Spread F (ESF), which
              are irregularities in the nighttime equatorial ionosphere that cause disruption
              to communication and navigation signals.  The development of these
              irregularities is highly unpredictable, but some studies have shown the
              existence of a precursor signature in oxygen dayglow emissions from the
              thermosphere.  The investigators have developed an optical instrument capable
              of observing faint oxygen emission line intensities buried in the strong
              daytime background continuum.  They will carry out these measurements with an
              aim to predict the ESF occurrence over South American longitudes from the
              Paranal observatory in Chile.  The measurements will be combined with those of
              other optical instruments and radars in South America to establish the
              existence of precursor signatures to equatorial spread F.  The development of a
              technique for predicting ESF will help to mitigate the effects these
              irregularities have on technical systems.
