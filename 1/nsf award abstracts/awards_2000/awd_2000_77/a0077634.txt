Nerve cells communicate information to each other at narrow
              zones of contact
referred to as synapses. The incoming presynaptic cell
              releases a chemical
signal (the neurotransmitter), which binds to receptors on
              the target cell,
eliciting electrical excitation or inhibition. The general
              goal of these
experiments is to understand the mechanisms that allow
              developing synapses
to reach their stable, mature state. The principal
              hypothesis to be explored
is that in addition to the two signals known to pass
              between nerve and
muscle to promote synapse maturation (agrin and ARIA), an
              additional
signaling system also transmits key information. This proposed
              signaling
system consists of ATP (adenosine 5' triphosphate) released from
              presynaptic
terminals interacting with two different types of ATP receptors on
              the
muscle cell surface. The hypothesis will be tested by using
              molecular
biological and pharmacological tools to alter the function of the
              ATP
receptors on the surface of chick muscle cells developing within the
              egg,
and in cell culture.

It is important that mature neuromuscular
              synapses be stable, so that they
can reliably control of the routine actions
              of the nervous system such as
commanding muscles to move in the pattern that
              allows us to breathe.
However, understanding the mechanisms that promote
              synaptic growth and
maturation are likely to also provide us with insight into
              the mechanisms
that bring about changes in synaptic function in other regions
              of the mature
nervous system where synapses are not always stable. Changes in
              the
amplitude of synaptic responses are thought to be the cellular basis
              by
which learning and forgetting occur.
