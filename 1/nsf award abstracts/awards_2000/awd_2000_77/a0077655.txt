Abstract    :
              This project will combine MHD modeling using the Michigan MHD code with
              satellite and ground-based observations to study the interaction of the solar
              wind with the magnetopause.  In particular, two topics will be examined.  The
              first topic is the mechanism by which momentum is transferred from the solar
              wind to the magnetosphere by reconnection at the dayside magnetopause.  The
              second topic will be the response of the magnetosphere to a change of the
              interplanetary magnetic field from southward to northward.
