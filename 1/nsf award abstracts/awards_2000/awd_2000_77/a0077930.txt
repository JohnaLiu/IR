Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Miami will acquire a
              MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number
              of areas including a) electrochemical transformations of fullerenes; b) novel
              redox self-assembling systems; c) chemical analysis of complex urban aerosols;
              d) oligonucleotide sequencing and micro-array biochip probe analysis of fungal
              species; and e) characterization of novel porphyrin arrays.  

Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
              to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
              and organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry, air quality and
              biology.
