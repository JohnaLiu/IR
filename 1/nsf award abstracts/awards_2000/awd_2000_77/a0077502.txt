Abstract    :
              This Dissertation Improvement Award will enhance ongoing studies on the swimming
              performance of the mako shark.  This work will provide new information about
              how makos, and their close relatives, resemble tunas in features related to an
              elevated metabolic rate and swimming capacity.  Characters unique to mako
              sharks and to tunas include modifications of the cardiorespiratory system,
              muscle morphology, elevated enzyme activities, and warm bodies.  The project's
              objectives are to obtain data on makos using a large water tunnel treadmill
              used previously for tunas, and to gather laboratory based data on the
              structural components involved in the delivery of oxygen to the muscles used to
              swim.  This project will address the energy requirements of makos for swimming
              and document the its ability to maintain a warm body temperature.  

This
              study is unprecedented in that it will use live mako sharks to measure
              variables that seem to be unique only to them, their close-relatives, and the
              tunas.  The results of this study will be compared with those obtained for
              tunas to enhance our knowledge of the evolutionary process in fishes.  This
              will show how organisms that have evolved independently for more than 400
              million years have developed unique and almost identical characters that allow
              for enhanced swimming performance.
