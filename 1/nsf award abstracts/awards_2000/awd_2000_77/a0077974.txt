Abstract    :
              Professors Frank DeLucia and Eric Herbst of the University of Ohio State
              University are funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform
              experimental and theoretical studies of low energy molecular collisions.   The
              goal is to understand the dynamics, spectroscopy and interactions which govern
              the behavior of low temperature (10K) collisions of small species such as
              helium, hydrogen, formaldehyde and carbon monoxide.  Under the experimental
              conditions here, the collision energies are less than the binding energies of
              the van der Waals complex between the collision partners.  (The well depths
              typically correspond to temperatures of less than a few tens of degrees). 
              Along with providing data on collisions of this type, the PIs will develop new
              experimental techniques such as state-to-state inelastic rotational energy
              transfer, collisional cooling methods and new molecular ion production methods.
              In particular, they  will attempt a molecular beam maser scheme which should
              allow them to overcome some previously encountered thermal averaging problems. 
              Some ab initio calculations will be performed that will aid in the data
              interpretation.  A successful outcome of this work will be highly accurate
              potentials describing interactions between ultracold molecules that will serve
              as benchmarks for quantum theory. 

These fundamental studies relate to the
              interconnected areas of quantum chemistry and scattering theory, and our
              understanding of chemical processes and energy transfer in the interstellar
              medium.    The work will also provide spectroscopic data of use for
              interpreting observations of astrophysical and atmospheric species.
