Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Mount Holyoke College will
              acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
              carry out studies on a) solution structures of small, diamagnetic proteins and
              peptides, as well as complex organic molecules including supramolecular
              assemblies; b) multi-nuclear NMR studies of transient organometallic
              intermediates; and c) determination of polymer microstructures.   

Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules
              in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry
              and biochemistry.
