Abstract    :
              
The Department of Mathematics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
              University will purchase a computing environment which will be dedicated to the
              support of research by faculty and graduate students in mathematics, in
              particular the research group on `Modeling and Analysis of Fluids, Interfaces
              and Amorphous Polymers' (http://www.math.vt.edu/people/renardyy/maa.html).
              

The equipment will be used for several projects which require the use of
              parallelized codes, including the following:

`Formulation of moving contact
              lines for the volume-of- uid scheme,' by Michael Renardy,

`Interfacial
              instabilities in viscoelastic flows,' by Yuriko Renardy,

`Drop breakup in
              3D,' by Jie Li,

`Simulation of a liquid bridge bathed in a surfactant
              solution,' by Mary Ann Clarke.
