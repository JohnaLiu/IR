Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State Institute will
              acquire a time-of-flightmass spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research
              in a number of areas including a) the development of new palladium-mediated
              synthetic organic methods; b) new pathways for the total synthesis of natural
              products; c) the design, synthesis and analysis of new high performance
              polymers; d) mechanisms of catalytic reactions promoted by organometallic
              complexes; and e) photocatalytic degradation of organic wastes in aqueous
              media.  

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate
              structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of
              organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The results from these
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials  and
              environmental sciences.
