The 2000 Gordon Research on Membranes: Materials and
              Processes


This award supports partially the participation by invited
              speakers and discussion leaders from academic institutions at the Gordon
              Conference on Membranes to be held in New London, NH, from July 30 to August 3,
              2000.  The sessions scheduled for this year's conference include membrane
              fundamentals, measurement methods, molecular-sieve membranes, inorganic
              membranes, membrane applications, modifications, novel membranes, and
              biomedical membranes.  In each session there will be two or three invited
              speakers.  Poster sessions are also planned.

The Gordon Conferences are kept
              small and are structured to give the participants considerable time for
              discussion and interaction.  They provide a vehicle for communication between
              research groups, which will be represented here by researchers not only from
              U.S. universities but also industry and universities in Europe and Japan.  This
              grant is specifically targeted to permit attendance by ten advanced-level
              graduate students in the conference.
