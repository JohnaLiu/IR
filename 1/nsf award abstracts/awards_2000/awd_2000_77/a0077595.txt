Abstract    :
              
	This project will combine animal physiology with biophysics and biochemistry
              in order to examine oxygen transport and consumption from whole animal to
              subcellular levels during the prolonged, spontaneous breath holds of elephant
              seals during sleep. Unique adaptations in these animals include enhanced oxygen
              storage and exquisite regulation of heart rate, blood flow and tissue metabolic
              rates. The physiological processes and biochemical mechanisms underlying these
              adaptations are relevant to the basic principles of oxygen transfer within
              tissues as well as to the remarkable diving abilities of seals and whales. 
	A
              variety of minimally- and non-invasive techniques, including blood/tissue
              sampling, blood flow measurements, and nuclear magnetic resonance
              imaging/spectroscopy, will allow study of these seals while they sleep
              undisturbed. This will allow: 1) examination of the regulation of heart rate,
              cardiac output and muscle blood flow throughout the ten-minute breath holds of
              these seals, 2) measurement of the rate of blood oxygen depletion throughout
              the breath-hold, 3) examination of blood-to-muscle oxygen transfer as the blood
              oxygen level decreases, 4) determination of the oxygen desaturation rate of
              myoglobin - the oxygen storage protein in muscle, 5) examination of metabolic
              regulation in muscle, as reflected in the depletion of the high-energy
              phosphate, phosphocreatine, and the formation of lactate, and 6) examination of
              the mobility of the myoglobin molecule within the muscle cell.
