Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma will
              acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
              carry out studies on a) the synthesis and characterization of liquid crystals;
              b) the synthesis, stabilization and applications of reactive organic moieties;
              c) the design and synthesis of chiral transition metal catalysts; d) the
              reactivity and synthetic utility of organotransition metal complexes; e) the
              structure and reactivity of metalloporphyrin-nitrosyl and -nitroso organic
              complexes; and f) the synthesis and characterization of group 13 organometallic
              compounds.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
              The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas
              including materials chemistry.
