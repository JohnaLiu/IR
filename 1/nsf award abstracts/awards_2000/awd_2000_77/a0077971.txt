     ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the universal
              chemical
energy molecule in all living cells.  ATP driven protein motors
play
              a central role in many cell functions.  For example, kinesin
drives
              intracellular vesicle transportation and moves chromosomes
during mitosis;
              myosin drives muscle contraction, and the
V-ATPases regulate intracellular
              acidity.  Understanding the
operating principles of the ATP driven motors is
              crucial to
comprehending intracellular protein transport and cell
              motility.
Structural studies are providing the atomic details of
              motor
proteins, and are revealing more information about the
conformational
              changes associated with the chemical reactions
they catalyze.  Current
              experimental technologies permit measuring
forces of a single protein motor
              with piconewton precision and
motions with nanometer resolution.  These
              advances, along with
advances in mathematical modeling and computer power,
              make it
possible to explore the mechanochemical energy transduction
              in
molecular motors in unprecedented detail.  In this project,
              the
investigator and colleagues pursue the mathematical and physical
issues
              that arose in the previous studies of F1 ATPase.  These
concern the molecular
              details of how protein motors should be
modeled and what mathematical
              formulations are adequate for
modeling them.  In particular, the study focuses
              on the mechanism
of force generation at the catalytic site during the
              ATP
hydrolysis cycle.  Resolution of this key process will illuminate
the
              operating principles of this ATP driven motor, and likely
other protein motors
              as well.  To accommodate more sophisticated
modeling, the investigator
              develops methods for analyzing protein
structures and solving complex model
              equations.  The results of
these studies set the stage for modeling the
              mechanochemical
energy transduction in myosin and kinesin dimers.  The
              approach is
to model the continuous stochastic motion of the motor
              using
stochastic differential equations and couple these to the
chemical
              reactions described by discrete Markov processes.  The
model equations are
              constructed from basic physical principles,
structural data, and biochemical
              and biophysical measurements.
These equations are then analyzed numerically. 
              The hope is that
this will lead to a unified view of ATP driven motors.
    
              To facilitate the fast growing field of biotechnology, it is
necessary to
              deduce concise mechanisms for biological systems
from experimental results. 
              This requires the application of
fundamental principles from the mathematical
              and physical
sciences.  The purpose of this interdisciplinary project is
              to
study the mechanisms by which proteins use chemical energy to
generate
              mechanical forces.  In turn, these forces drive a wide
variety of cellular
              processes essential to life.  In all living
cells, the universal chemical
              energy molecule is ATP (adenosine
triphosphate).  ATP is produced using the
              energy extracted from
food, and the life of every cell depends on processes
              that are
powered by ATP.  For example, muscle contraction is directly
driven
              by the ATP protein motor myosin.  Therefore, understanding
the operating
              principles of the ATP protein motors is central to
comprehending the life of
              cells.
