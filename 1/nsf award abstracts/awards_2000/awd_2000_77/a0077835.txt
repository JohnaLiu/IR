Abstract    :
              This is a two-part project that explores intense laser-plasma interactions and
              their applications.  In the first part experiments will be done to investigate
              the use of the laser-produced plasma waveguide for nonlinear generation of
              coherent, short wavelength light.  A great improvement over previous
              experiments will be the use of an elongated pulsed gas jet that will allow both
              injection of higher intensity pulses into the waveguide and reduced absorption
              of x-rays propagating out of the waveguide.  The second part of the project
              will investigate in detail the dynamics of the interaction of intense laser
              pulses with clusters formed through van der Waals bonding of atoms and
              molecules in a supersonic gas jet expansion.  These clusters are a leading
              candidate for the extreme ultraviolet light source needed for next generation
              lithography.  Experiments will be performed to explore the laser-cluster
              interaction dynamics with femtosecond time-resolved interferometry, fast
              particle spectroscopy, and EUV and x-ray spectroscopy.
