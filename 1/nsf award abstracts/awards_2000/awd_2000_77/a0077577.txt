The Ribosome Biogenesis and
              Nucleolar Function meeting (planned for August 17-21, 2000 in Tahoe, CA), is
              the fifth in a series of tri-annual meetings. The purpose of these meetings is
              to give workers in the field, including post-docs and students, an up-to-date
              view of research addressing all aspects of ribosome biogenesis. Ribosomes are
              essential to survival of all organisms, from bacteria to humans. The formation
              of ribosomes requires a complicated, but highly coordinated, set of reactions,
              including transcription, translation, splicing, RNA processing, trafficking of
              ribosomal components and assembled precursor ribosomal particles, and RNA and
              protein modifications. The investigation of this extensive suite of reactions,
              which collectively accomplish the biogenesis of new ribosomes, requires many
              types of expertise, including enzymology, genetics, cytology and
              ultramicroscopic analysis. No single lab can possess all of these types of
              expertise, yet every worker investigating an aspect of ribosome biogenesis
              should understand the progress in all other areas. The meeting brings together
              researchers working on all aspects of ribosome synthesis in a variety of
              organisms, from eubacteria through humans.
