Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at John Carroll University will
              acquire an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer.  The new
              instrument will support the research of major users at both John Carroll
              University and Youngstown State University.  Among the research programs in
              which EPR spectroscopy will play a vital role are: 1) probing the active site
              of blue copper proteins; b) systematic study of titatnium (III) in the presence
              of biologically relevant ligands and a spin-trap; c) structural analysis of an
              iron-sulfur cluster associated with cytoplasmic aconitase; d) investigation of
              the electronic states of novel thiovanadyl complexes and new radical anions of
              cyanoacacarbons; e) determination of high or low-spin crossover in manganese
              and chromium metallocenophane complexes; and f) analysis of redox states of
              doped rutile pigments.

An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer
              is an instrument used to obtain information about the molecular and electronic
              structure of molecules. It may also be used to obtain information about the
              lifetimes of free radicals which are often essential for the initiation of
              tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions.  These studies will have
              an impact in a number of areas, especially biochemistry.
