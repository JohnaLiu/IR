This award provides support for the travel of U.S. student
              and post-doctoral fellows to participate in the Conference "Non-Invasive
              Assessment of Trabecular Bone Micro-architecture and Competence of Bone" to be
              held at Big Sur, California, May 7-9, 2000.  Recipients of support are to be
              selected by the Conference Organizing Committee based on their research focus
              and productivity.  

The subject matter of the Conference relates directly to
              two important Program priorities: research in biomechanical properties of bone
              and tissue, and the encouragement of students and young professionals to engage
              in research activities. The meeting will provide the opportunity for attendees
              to meet and confer with world leaders in biomaterials and biomechanics
              research, as is illustrated by the list of anticipated participants compiled by
              the Principal Investigator. The proceedings of the Conference are to be
              published in a book by the University of California San Francisco Post Graduate
              Education Division.
