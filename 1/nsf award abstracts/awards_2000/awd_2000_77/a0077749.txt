Abstract    :
              Plants and animals display an amazing array of reproductive systems.  One of the
              most intriguing is "androdioecy," in which males coexist with hermaphrodites
              (individuals in which both sexes are present), but there are no true females. 
              Androdioecy is rare, as predicted by theory, yet there are a few,
              well-documented cases in plants and animals.  This project is a continuation of
              earlier experiments exploring androdioecy in a freshwater crustacean, the clam
              shrimp Eulimnadia texana.  A three-year examination of this species revealed
              both benefits and detriments to males, and thus to better understand this
              mating system, refinement of these results is required.  Additionally, all
              previous experiments were conducted in laboratory settings.  To truly
              understand the system, field experiments need to be conducted.  The two
              proposed projects will accomplish both of these goals: (1) a laboratory
              experiment will measure the relationship between the proportion of males and
              male mating effectiveness in two natural populations, and (2) development of
              "microsatellite loci" will allow genetic "fingerprinting" of field-collected
              shrimp so that the previous laboratory experiments can be extended into the
              field.
	The proposed projects are one of the few attempts to delineate the
              benefits of outcrossing (offspring produced by mating with males) in an animal
              system.  This information is crucial for developing breeding programs, both in
              agriculture and for the maintenance of endangered species.
