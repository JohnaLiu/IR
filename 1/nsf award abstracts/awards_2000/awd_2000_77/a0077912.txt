The normal development of embryos requires the precise
              specification of specific tissue types, and failures in that specification
              underlie many birth defects and congenital diseases.  Signaling between tissues
              and cells during development often plays a critical role in this process. 
              However, the details underlying many important signaling pathways, and the ways
              in which such signals interact, is still quite poorly understood.  This project
              examines the way in which three important signals, those mediated by the EGF,
              BMP and Wingless/Wnt pathways, are controlled and interact to specify one
              tissue type.  The model system used for this work is the wing of the fruitfly,
              Drosophila melanogaster.  The advantages of this model system are several; the
              genetic and molecular analyses possible in Drosophila are perhaps unmatched by
              any other animal, and the mechanisms underlying development of the Drosophila
              wing shows several striking parallels with the mechanisms used in humans and
              other mammals.  The work focuses specifically on the development of veins
              within the wing, and proposes the identification of previously undiscovered
              regulators of signaling by characterizing mutations that affect that process. 
              Analyses are already underway on three such mutations: crossveinless-2,
              crossveinless-3, and detached.  Preliminary work indicates that the gene
              disrupted by crossveinless-2 encodes a novel protein likely to directly
              potentiate BMP-like signaling during vein development by binding to the BMP
              ligand itself.
