Abstract    :
              Cox

     Information processing along and between nerve cells
              is
achieved via electrodiffusion along branches and across cell
membranes. 
              The relatively poor axial conductance of the branches
is offset by the myriad
              of ion channels that perforate the cell
membrane.  A nerve cell's salient
              physical, as opposed to
geometrical, properties are then its axial
              conductance, its
membrane's capacitance and permeability to one or more
              ionic
species and the kinetics (rules that govern its open/closed
state) of
              the underlying channels.  The predictive utility of a
mathematical model of
              course hinges on the accuracy to which
these physical properties are known. 
              Unfortunately, the
experimental determination of each of these quantities is
              a
formidable task that, in light of recent data suggesting that
              the
permeabilities vary with position in the dendritic tree, requires
great
              investment for all but the simplest geometries.  The
investigator and his
              colleagues therefore determine the extent to
which the neuron's physical
              properties may be inferred from more
readily available indirect measurements. 
              These indirect
measurements are recordings of somatic and distal
              membrane
potential following a known current stimulus to the soma.
Assuming
              current seals at the distal ends, these two potential
recordings result in
              lateral overdetermination of the underlying
degenerate-parabolic system of
              Hodgkin-Huxley equations.  The
investigator and his colleagues deduce from
              this overdetermined
system a number of well posed problems, and associated
              algorithms
(based on moment, fixed-point and output least squares
              methods),
for the recovery of one or more of the neuron's
              physical
properties.  They test these algorithms on data recorded
              from
pyramidal neurons drawn from the rat's hippocampus.
     In order to
              repair or reproduce the brain one must have a
parts list and a blueprint
              specifying how the parts are to be
connected.  At the coarsest level there are
              but two types of
parts, nerves (neurons) and nerve glue (glial cells).  Though
              the
human brain has more of each than the Milky Way has stars, it is
not
              their sheer number but rather a subtle combination of
interconnectedness and
              variation in electrical properties that
render the brain so powerful.  The
              term `variation' is meant to
express the realization that a neuron is not
              simply a switch
within a certain brain center or a wire connecting two
              such
centers, but rather is a tree of wires with electrical
              properties
varying along each of its branches.  It is this local variation
              in
a neuron's ability to conduct the brain's principal ions that is
thought
              to be responsible for an individual neuron's ability to
perform tasks
              reminiscent of rudimentary computers.  Given however
the minute size and
              variegated nature of a single neuron, the
direct experimental determination of
              its electrical properties
has yet to be achieved.  The investigator and his
              colleagues
therefore pursue the mathematically challenging task
              of
determining these properties from more readily available, though
indirect,
              experimental measurements.  This process is akin to
determining the size and
              location of a leak in a transatlantic
telephone cable by comparing what the
              American said to what the
Englishman heard.  The success of their endeavor,
              coupled with the
increasingly fine resolution of images of
              neuronal
interconnections, will permit the investigator and his colleagues
to
              produce models of sufficient veracity to be of use by the
medical community
              from construction of prosthetic neuronal
circuits to the design and testing of
              drugs and better
treatments.
