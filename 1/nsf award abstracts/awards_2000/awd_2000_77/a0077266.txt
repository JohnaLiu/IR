This grant continues to support the work of this midcareer
              PI on quantum anomalies in transport, dissipation and related phenomena in
              ultra-thin micro and nanoscale systems with special emphasis on quantum size
              effect conditions.  The linkage between different projects on properties of
              various quasi-2d physical systems is a study of the effects of surface
              roughness.  This is based on a novel formalism developed by the PI.  Different
              projects include: (1) Transport and dissipation in ultra-thin systems with
              quantum size effect, (2) accommodation on rough surfaces and slip length, (3)
              Surface roughness and friction in quantized systems, (4) time dependent
              roughness and finally ( 5) periodically modulated walls with or without random
              roughness.

In a film so thin that the size effects are quantum
              mechanical, there are a variety of possible novel effects related to disorder. 
              For example, the external surfaces may be rough and lead to additional
              resistance to the motion of electrons in a metal.  The grant here continues to
              support the work of this midcareer PI, who has developed a novel formalism to
              study precisely these effects.  The effects appear in transport phenomena, e.g.
              flow impedance or electrical resistance of nanoscale thin metallic films.  They
              might appear in properties of friction or accommodation (sticking of fast
              moving particles near a surface).  Finally there are conditions where the
              surface may be periodically moving or it might have roughness which varies in
              time.  These ideas have application in a wide variety of areas, ranging from
              properties of ultra-thin films to flow of classical gases past rough walls, and
              to propagation of waves past rough walls.
