Abstract    :
              The major emphasis of this research project is the solid state chemistry of new
              classes of extended solids that are of electronic, magnetic, and/or catalytic
              importance.  The purpose of this interdisciplinary research program is to
              provide means for student education through synthesis, characterization, and
              correlation studies of novel solids.  The aim of the proposed research aligns
              with the goals set forth in the 1998 NSF Workshop Report on the Current Status
              and Future Developments in Solid State and Materials Chemistry.  The scope of
              the proposal is two-fold: 1) mixed-framework compounds containing structurally
              confined transition-metal-oxide lattices, and 2) open-framework solids via
              salt-inclusion reactions.  The project covers a broad range of fundamental
              inorganic chemistry, including synthesis, structure, bonding, electronic
              structure, magnetochemistry, and materials chemistry.  Compound
              characterization will be directed toward revealing and understanding the bond
              strength, spin-spin and spin-lattice interactions, band structures, the onset
              of metallic properties associated with finite transition metal oxide
              structures, and the formation of metal-containing-microporous and mesoporous
              frameworks exhibiting superior structural and physical properties

This study
              will contribute valuable knowledge needed to achieve state materials synthesis
              by design.  This well integrated research and education project will generate
              scientifically skilled students and postdoctoral fellows able to make a timely
              impact on the advancement of materials research.
