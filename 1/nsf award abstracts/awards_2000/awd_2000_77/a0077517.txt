Abstract    :
              Professor James Weisshaar of the University of Wisconsin Madison is supported by
              the Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental and
              theoretical studies on peptides oriented in liquid crystals using Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance.  This proposal seeks to make detailed experimental NMR
              measurements on the structures adopted by small model peptides in solution to
              calibrate and sharpen the accuracy of molecular force fields. Di-, tri- and
              possibly tetra- peptides will be studied in liquid crystals, a means by which
              the problem of the rapid tumbling and averaging of molecules in solution can be
              overcome.   In order to fully characterize the peptides in their conformational
              diversity, a large number of magnetic dipole couplings between nuclear spins
              will be measured.  The signals will be fit to those predicted from ab initio
              theory for a superposition of possible stable structures, with iterations on
              the distribution of conformers and on the force fields.  Successful fitting for
              small, flexible peptides would provide an important step towards cracking the
              multi-conformation problem in flexible regions of proteins.  

NMR and X-ray
              methods, the two major methods for solving protein structures, are limited in
              characterizing the flexible local conformations within proteins.  Computational
              approaches can assist in obtaining these conformations, however, the
              calculations are only as good as the force fields used.  This proposal seeks to
              provide experimental data aimed at improving the calculations.  It  is
              especially timely because of the increasing massive efforts to calculate
              protein structures and protein folding processes.
