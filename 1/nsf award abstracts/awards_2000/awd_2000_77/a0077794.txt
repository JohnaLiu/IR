     The investigator and his colleagues organize an
              international conference on mathematics in biology at the University of Utah
              from August 3-5, 2000.  Application of mathematical methods to biology is
              revolutionizing our understanding of subjects ranging from genomics to cancer
              to environmental change.  During this time of rapid growth in mathematical
              biology, the goal of the meeting is to highlight current top-level research, to
              provide a perspective on future research areas, to provide opportunities for
              career development to junior researchers, and to foster interactions between
              established researchers and junior researchers.  The meeting includes
              scientific sessions on epidemiology, biofluids, molecular motors, theoretical
              ecology, cancer dynamics, and immunology.  Beyind this, it incorporates a
              careers session, an education minisymposium, and a new mentoring program to
              nurture employment in the subject, improve the way it is taught, and provide
              contacts for junior researchers.

     Biology is becoming a more
              mathematical subject.  Insights gained from applying mathematical methods to
              biological problems are reshaping our understanding of everything from the
              genome up to entire ecosystems.  This conference describes recent advances in
              several areas.  It also includes sessions that aim to foster both the
              development of junior researchers and greater interactions among biologists and
              mathematicians.
