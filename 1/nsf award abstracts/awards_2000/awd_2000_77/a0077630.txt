The overall goal of this project is to
              understand the role of cholesterol in biological membranes. This project has
              four main conceptual elements: (i) 3-component lipid mixtures, containing
              cholesterol, will serve as chemically simple experimental models of mammalian
              plasma membranes; (ii) Several independent, complementary methods will be used
              to thoroughly map and characterize the compositional  phase behavior of these
              model membranes; (iii) Based on the observed phase behavior, Monte Carlo
              simulations will be used to find the dominant microscopic lipid-lipid
              interaction energies;  and (iv) The lateral distributions of other membrane
              components will be studied in these well-characterized systems, shedding light
              on the nature of cholesterol-rich "detergent resistant membranes." 
              Experimentally, this project involves x-ray diffraction to find phase
              boundaries; electron spin resonance to map order parameters of the phases;
              pyrene excimer/monomer ratios and fluorescence resonance energy transfer to
              find phase boundaries and to measure partitioning between phases; confocal
              fluorescence microscopy to visualize coexisting phases; and computer
              simulations to evaluate the thermodynamic implications of microscopic
              interaction models and to generate pictures of lateral distributions.
              

Although cholesterol is the single most abundant lipid species in mammalian
              plasma membranes, the underlying nature of its interactions with neighboring
              membrane molecules has remained obscure.  This research will provide an
              in-depth physical understanding of these underlying lipid-lipid interactions
              and could therefore have a very significant impact on the field of signal
              transduction.
