Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks to explain why the Egyptian government established an
              independent constitutional court that has increasingly constrained its ability
              to control opponents of the regime. The PI hypothesizes that the constitutional
              court was established by the regime in order to encourage private investment in
              Egypt's newly liberalized economy and that the court has been able to withstand
              increasing pressure from the executive branch by supporting the regime's
              economic liberalization program and by cultivating important networks of
              support with opposition parties, legal associations, and business groups.  This
              study is designed with several theory-development goals in mind: to assess the
              impact of economic liberalization upon national judicial institutions in the
              developing world; to better understand the role of legal institutions in
              economic development; and to increase understanding of the conditions under
              which independent judicial institutions emerge from within non-liberal
              polities.
   
To test these hypotheses, the PI will conduct 12 months of
              research in Cairo, Egypt and will analyze constitutional court cases for
              evidence of court activism over time and across economic and political issue
              areas.  Cases will be coded according to their impact on the regime and on
              other dimensions relevant to strategic behavior by the judges.  The PI will
              also trace a sample of rulings to ascertain impediments to the implementation
              of court rulings.
