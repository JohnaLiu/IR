Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University  will
              acquire an X-ray powder diffractometer  with area detector and variable
              temperature capability.  This equipment will enhance research in a number of
              areas including the following: a) studies on liquid crystalline phases and the
              nature of the supramolecular structures in these systems; b) intermolecular
              interactions of and the supramolecular architecture of low molecular mass
              gelator materials within gel matrices; c) the relationship between growth of
              nanocrystalline solids in preferred orientations and resulting optical effects;
              and d) the identification of solid state materials via the determination of
              cell constants.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise
              measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including
              bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the
              spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. 
              These studies will have a signifcant impact in materials sciences.
