Abstract

The mammalian p70S6 kinase, termed S6K1, is a
              mitogen-stimulated serine/threonine kinase that lies on a signaling pathway
              leading to the control of translation and cell growth. The current model for
              S6K1 function is that upon activation, S6K1 phosphorylated the 40S ribosomal
              subunit protein S6 and this causes the ribosome to selectively increase the
              translation of a group of mRNAs that encode ribosomal proteins and translation
              initiation factors. This series of events would be expected to increase
              ribosome biogenesis and the translational capacity of the cell and thus allow
              increased general protein synthesis and cell growth. The activation of S6K1 is
              complex and is associated with the phosphorylation of eight amino acids in the
              kinase. The signaling pathways that lead to S6K1 activation are only partially
              defined and only the identity of one of the kinases that phosphorylates one of
              the eight phosphorylated amino acids inS6K1 that are associated with the
              activation of the kinase is known. The Drosophila melanogaster S6 kinase
              homolog, dS6K, is structurally and functionally conserved with the mammalian
              S6K1. In cultured cells, dS6K can be activated or inhibited by agents that
              activate or inhibit S6K1, suggesting that the mechanisms that regulate dS6K and
              S6K1 activation will be conserved between Drosophila and mammals. Similar to
              the proposed role for S6K1 in translation and growth, the role for dS6K within
              the fly appears to be in regulating cell size, cell growth and cell
              proliferation. The overall goal of this proposal is to use the power of
              Drosophila genetics to identify novel components of the dS6K pathway. Reaching
              this goal will entail:
1. Testing if mutant alleles of genes that encode
              suspected components of the dS6K signaling pathway interact genetically with
              mutant dS6K alleles
2. Screening a collection of Drosophila deficiency stocks
              to identify dose-sensitive modifiers of dS6K mutant phenotypes
3. Performing
              mutagenesis screens designed to identify newly induced mutations in genes that
              encode components of the dS6K signaling pathways.

Identifying components of
              the dS6K signaling pathways will be important for increasing our knowledge of
              intracellular signaling and also should impact our understanding of the basic
              mechanisms that regulate translation and cell growth.
