In 1994, a new songbird disease appeared in
              House Finches in backyards in Maryland.  The severe eye and respiratory disease
              that was observed in these birds was caused by a bacterium, Mycoplasma
              gallicepticum (MG), which had apparently "jumped" from poultry.  Since 1994,
              this disease has spread throughout eastern North America, killing an estimated
              100 million House Finches.  This study focuses on the co-evolution of this
              parasite and its newly colonized host.  There has been steady decline in the
              incidence of mycoplasmosis in eastern House Finches since the epidemic year of
              1995/6.  This suggests that either finches have evolved genetic resistance to
              the disease, that MG has evolved reduced virulence, or that some combination of
              change in resistance and virulence has occurred.  A combination of field
              observations, controlled infection experiments, and genetic analysis will be
              used to test for evolved genetic resistance to MG in finches and to test for
              change in virulence in the MG.   

While this research focuses on a disease
              that does not infect humans, much can be learned from a study of the
              interaction of a vertebrate population and a novel pathogen.  
We live in an
              age of globalization with new pathogens constantly being spread among
              populations of domestic animals, wildlife, and humans.  Understanding the
              dynamic nature of interactions between parasites and hosts will provide
              critical information to help us deal with these new infectious diseases.
