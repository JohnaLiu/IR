     This project tracks changes
              in world economic and political systems in the 19th and 20th centuries. 
              Overall, those systems have become more similar and interrelated, changes that
              have led some observers to speak of a single world system at present.  This
              project develops data on investment and political change to existing data on
              economic development and international conflict.  The second phase of the work
              uses that dataset to examine how the various kinds of changes are associated
              with each other and which ones lead to others.  Generally, as political
              uniformity increases, conflict decreases, and at least in some cases,
              increasing trade and economic development follows that.  This project
              contributes to understanding these changes and how they affect each other.
