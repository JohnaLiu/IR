Abstract    :
              

Partial support is provided for the bianual gordon Research Corporation on
              Tribology.  The conference has the subtitle "Bridging the Gaps" and will
              attempt to bridge gaps in scale, gaps between sub-disciplines, and gaps between
              applied and bais research.  It will also attempt to bridge any gaps in age and
              experience by brining experienced as well as new researchers and graduate
              students together for informal discussions.
