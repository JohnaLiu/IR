Abstract    :
              A Gordon Research Conference(GRC) on the Chemistry and Physics of Nanostructure
              Fabrication will be held July 23-28, 2000. The science and engineering of
              nanostructure fabrication is of particular interest to electronics/photonics
              and related areas since future progress in the field may be paced by advances
              in the science and technology of nanofabrication. The general conference topic
              is highly multidisciplinary, and will include: proximal probe fabrication,
              manipulation, and measurement; single electron phenomena; beyond ULSI to QLSI;
              quantum devices; novel devices and fabrication; chemical and biological
              nanostructures.
The conference format - a week of continuous interaction with
              experts in interrelated fields in a casual setting -provides special
              opportunities for scientists and students to exchange ideas. All participants
              will have the opportunity to hear first hand high quality scientific work and
              novel ideas emerging in the field, and the opportunity to establish
              relationships and interact with other attendees. Such opportunities are
              particularly beneficial to students and young scientists.

An evaluation
              of the progress and status of Chemistry and Physics of Nanostructure
              Fabrication along with current assessments of the most important developments
              in this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced
              utilization of electronic/photonic materials in computing, data processing, and
              communications. The Conference is co-supported by the CTS/FPH and ECS/EPDT
              programs.
