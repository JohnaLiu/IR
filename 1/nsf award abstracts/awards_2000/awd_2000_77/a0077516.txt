Myosins are molecular motors that use stored
              chemical energy resources in cells to produce movement.  For example, myosin
              hydrolyzes ATP to produce the force for muscle contraction.  The myosins
              constitute a very large family of related proteins, each of which has a
              specialized function.  This proposal studies the expression of a myosin 1
              isoform whose expression is restricted to nerve tissue.  The function of this
              myosin in moving critical components around the cell, such as vesicles
              containing neurotransmitters, as well as the role it might play in the
              embryonic development of the nervous system, is being investigated using the
              classic vertebrate model system of the frog.

Data gathered about the
              developing embryonic nervous system should aid in the understanding of certain
              birth defects as well as spinal cord injuries and neuro-degenerative diseases. 
              Other investigators have linked genetic defects in different myosins to human
              diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and inherited deafness or Usher
              syndrome. Moreover, an additional benefit is gained.  The training
              undergraduate students receive as they perform meaningful, high quality,
              research, profoundly influences their career goals.
