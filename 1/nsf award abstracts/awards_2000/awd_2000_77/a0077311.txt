Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. George Gumerman IV and his
              colleagues will continue their archaeological excavation at the site of El
              Brujo, located on the arid northern coast of Peru. The El Brujo complex, over a
              square kilometer in size, consists of a series of pyramids and associated
              domestic architecture dating from approximately 4000 BC through colonial times.
              The site contains a substantial component referable to the Moche culture (AD
              200-800) that is spatially segregated from earlier and later components. The
              presence of monumental architecture and associated domestic zones suggests that
              the site probably served as a major political and ceremonial center. Prior work
              at the site by both Gumerman and other groups indicates that organic materials
              including textiles and botanical remains are remarkably well preserved. This
              amazing preservation offers an unparalleled opportunity to explore specific
              aspects of Moche foodways. To complement their previous work in the monumental
              center, they will now focus on related areas of domestic habitation.

The
              Moche peoples occupied the northern coast of Peru and are archaeologically
              significant for several reasons. It is possible to trace their development for
              over a millennium from a simple level of village organization to complex
              primitive state. Lacking writing and situated in a harsh and unpredictable
              desert environment the Moche were able to unite a large population scattered
              over separate isolated river valleys into a single political entity. Through a
              complex irrigation system they produced sufficient surplus to erect monumental
              pyramids and other ceremonial structures. Archaeologists wish to understand how
              this culture developed and was maintained. Dr. Gumerman has proposed a unique
              approach and plans to focus on how food moved through the social system. He
              will study not only production of both plant and animal species, but also their
              distribution through the social system, consumption and final discard. In this
              way it will be possible to address issues such as the development of social
              hierarchy and ceremonial/ritual behavior. He will excavate a series of Moche
              households to collect and analyze not only flora and fauna but also lithic and
              ceramic remains. On this basis it will also be possible to address questions
              such as status differentiation.

This research is important for several
              reasons. It will increase our understanding of the development of social
              complexity. It will shed new light on an important archaeological culture and
              will also help to develop an analytic approach of potential use in many parts
              of the world.
