Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis of a number of substructures or
              fragment of an expanded version of "cubic graphite."  These fragments, with
              formulae ranging from C168H116 to C672H432, contain large cavities and
              channels.  The fundamental repeating units are hexaphenylbenzene molecules,
              linked together at the para positions of the phenyl groups.  Palladium
              catalyzed coupling reactions (Suzuki couplings) will be carried out using
              simple derivatives of hexaphenylbenzene. Approximately ten halogenated or
              organoboron-containing derivatives of hexaphenylbenzene will be prepared as
              building blocks, and from this library, a variety of substructures will be
              made.  The cyclodehydrogenation of these substructures will be attempted,
              perhaps to yield yield homologs of cubic graphite where benzene rings have been
              replaced by hexabenzocoronenes.  As many of the target molecules as possible
              will be characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction methods.

With this
              renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
              the research of Dr. Robert A. Pascal of the Department of Chemistry at
              Princeton University.  Professor Pascal will focus his work on the synthesis of
              large polyphenyl aromatic compounds.  The compounds are based on the structure
              of so-called "cubic graphite," a hypothetical allotrope of carbon composed of
              benzene rings interconnected in three dimensions in a cubic space group.  The
              compounds could have host-guest applications or use in separation technology.  
              In terms of broader impacts, the Pascal group has proven to be an excellent
              venue for the training of both undergraduate and graduate students.
