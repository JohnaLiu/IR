Abstract    :
              With this award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its
              support for the work of Gideon A. Fraenkel in the Department of Chemistry at
              Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.   The work is aimed at understanding
              the details of the structures and solution dynamics of a variety of
              organolithium compounds, using a combination of synthesis, dynamic NMR, x-ray
              crystallography, and gradient corrected Density Functional Theory.   The
              questions to be addressed include: 1) What are the solution structures of
              ion-paired organolithium compounds? 2) To what extent does stereochemical
              restriction by a pendant ligand perturb conjugation within allylic lithium
              compounds? 3) Does heavy alkyl substitution affect conjugation? and 4) Does Li
              ion coordination to a remote C-C double bond affect RLi
              addition?

Organolithium compounds self assemble into equilibrium mixtures of
              rapidly interconverting species which vary in aggregation and solvation.  
              Understanding the details of the rates and equilibria of these compounds is
              expected to improve the ability of organic chemists to employ them to carry out
              useful organic syntheses, for example in the production of improved rubber for
              tires.   The combination of synthesis, spectroscopy, and theory should provide
              valuable training for the students involved in the research.
