Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project  involves the
              development of a commercial optical patternator, based on Statistical
              Absorption Tomography.  The mathematical deconvolution procedure that forms the
              basis for optical patternation of turbulent flows was developed and evaluated
              during the Phase I research. Local absorptances, resolved to less than 1/10th
              of the integral length scale were obtained in a turbulent spray, using the
              deconvolution algorithm, in conjunction with an optical patternator, suited for
              constant temperature, axisymmetric flows. During the Phase II, three research
              issues that affect the commercialization of the optical patternator will be
              addressed. The three issues that will be addressed during the Phase II research
              are: (1) obtaining local transmittances in turbulent flows with temperature
              gradients, (2) obtaining spatially resolved mass flux in turbulent sprays, and
              (3) obtaining patternation factors for turbulent flows issuing from
              non-axisymmetric nozzles.

Two broad areas of commercial applications for the
              optical patternator are for obtaining pattern factors in commercial nozzles and
              for monitoring smoke stack emissions.  The immediate market for the patternator
              is as an on-line quality control instrument for spray nozzle manufacturers. 
              The estimated annual market size is approximately 150 million dollars.
