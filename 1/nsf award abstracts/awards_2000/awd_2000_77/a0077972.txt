Abstract    :
              With support from the  Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Gonzaga University will acquire a 300
              MHz NMR Spectrometer, workstations and printer. This equipment will enable
              researchers at this undergraduate institution to carry out studies on a)  the
              preparation of novel solid state materials, including nonlinear optical
              materials and intercalated materials; b) the synthesis and characterization of
              biomolecular analogs that will be useful in probing the structure of proteins
              and other biochemical macromolecules; c) synthetic organic chemistry and
              development of new methodology for the synthesis of polyketide natural
              products; and d) the synthesis of transition metal porphyrin complexes that may
              serve as models for metalloenzymes.   This equipment will also be used in
              upper-division chemistry laboratory courses.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry and
              biochemistry.
