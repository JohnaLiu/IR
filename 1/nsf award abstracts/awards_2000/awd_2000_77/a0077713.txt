Abstract    :
              The long term goal of this project is to identify, characterize, and understand
              the function of genes and naturally occurring allelic variants present in the
              sorghum germplasm collection that contribute to plant adaptation to the
              environment.  The research team will map and sequence cDNA tags (short DNA
              sequences copied from mRNA) encoded by several gene dense regions of the
              sorghum genome using 'direct selection' technology and identify sorghum abiotic
              response genes by sequence similarity and cross species 'direct selection'. 
              This research will further develop direct selection technology for gene
              mapping, physical map construction, and cross species analysis.

The research
              team is constructing an integrated genetic, physical, and gene content map of
              the sorghum genome using a novel approach based on multi-dimensional pooling of
              Bacteria Artificial Chromosome (BAC) DNA, Amplified Fragment Length
              Polymorphism (AFLP) technology, and DNA fingerprinting.  A high throughput
              'direct selection' gene mapping technology has been developed to map genes
              across the gene-dense portions of the sorghum genome.  This activity will
              provide valuable information about gene order in grasses, identify candidate
              genes in trait loci, help construct integrated genetic and physical maps, and
              create a deep collection of gene tags for microarrays.
