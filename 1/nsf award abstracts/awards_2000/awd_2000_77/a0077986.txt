     The investigator develops mathematical methods
              for
difference and differential equation models to better predict
under what
              conditions biological invasions succeed and the
implications of successful
              invasions on the structure of
ecological communities.  An emphasis is placed
              on methods that are
robust to structural perturbations of the population
              equations
and that apply to systems with nonlinear dynamics
              (e.g.,
periodicity, quasiperiodicity, and chaos).  The methods involve
the
              use and development of techniques from smooth ergodic theory.
Application of
              these methods to models of host-parasitoid
interactions and tritrophic food
              webs is pursued.  Two aspects of
host-parasitoid interactions are examined. 
              First, because
parasitoids experience egg limitation when released in
              systems
with highly variable host densities (the typical situation when
an
              exotic insect has reached pest status), a model of
host-parasitoid
              interactions that incorporates this
egg-limitation is considered.  As
              successful biological control
only occurs after a parasitoid population has
              established itself,
the proposed analysis of the model intends to determine
              how
variability in the dynamics of the host population influences
              the
invasion rate of the parasitoid population.  Second, previous work
on the
              coevolution of patch selection strategies in
host-parasitoid systems is
              extended to include two important
biological factors, the sex-allocation
              strategies of parasitoids
and plant dynamics.  The key issue is whether the
              manipulation of
crop heterogeneity can lead to the coevolution of
              behavioral
traits that simultaneously stabilize the system and increase
              crop
yields.  Third, to better understand how ecological communities
assemble
              due to invasions, this proposal undertakes the study of
tritrophic systems
              with more than one species at each trophic
level.  In these systems, three
              ecological forces (apparent
competition, resource competition and intraguild
              predation) play
an important role and can lead to successional
              intransitivites
(e.g., a sequence of invasions that takes community A
              to
community B, B to C and C back to A).  Emphasis is placed on the
influence
              of habitat productivity and the timing of invasions on
the community assembly
              process.  In addition, the project includes
a program designed to stimulate
              undergraduate research.
     Invading non-native species in the United States
              cause
estimated economic losses of 138 billion dollars annually
              in
agriculture, forestry and several other segments of the U.S.
economy. 
              Exotic insect species alone are estimated to cause 13
billion dollars in crop
              losses annually and approximately 42% of
the species on the threatened or
              endangered species lists are at
risk primarily because of nonnative species. 
              As biological
invasions often involve nonlinear interactions between
              several
species, mathematical models, as simple caricatures, allow one
              to
inexpensively answer questions such as: What characteristics make
a
              species a successful invader?  Which ecological communities are
most
              susceptible to large long-term changes following an
invasion?  How can crop
              heterogeneity be manipulated to minimize
the economic impact of non-native
              pests?  The project proposes to
develop analytical methods, and to apply these
              methods to models
that address these and other questions of current interest
              to
community ecology, restoration ecology, biological control,
              and
evolutionary biology.
