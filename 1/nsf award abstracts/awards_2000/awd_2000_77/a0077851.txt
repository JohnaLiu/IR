     The investigator seeks advances in the reconstruction
              of
phylogenetic, or evolutionary, trees in biology by improving the
utility
              of the method of phylogenetic invariants, one of several
different methods of
              tree reconstruction.  It would be extremely
useful to have an accurate,
              computationally efficient method of
phylogenetic analysis, but no such method
              is yet known.  The
method of phylogenetic invariants theoretically has
              these
advantages.  Modern phylogenetic methods analyze the mathematical
and
              statistical similarities between the nucleotide sequences of
different
              species.  By modeling the evolution of the sequence for
a proposed
              evolutionary tree T as a Markov model, one can obtain
polynomials specifying
              the frequencies with which certain
patterns should occur in observed sequence
              data.  These
polynomials parameterize a high-dimensional real
              algebraic
variety X.  Finding the equations that implicitly define X
              is
theoretically equivalent to knowing how to determine whether T is
the
              "true" evolutionary tree.  These equations have been
previously found for
              special evolutionary models such as the
Kimura 3-parameter model.  The
              investigator studies the
invariants for the most general Markov model of
              nucleotide
sequences and uses a combination of combinatorics and
              non-abelian
Fourier analysis to find a complete set of invariants.  He
              also
explores ways to reduce the method's sensitivity to evolutionary
noise
              and raising its accuracy.  Advances on these issues are
essential to make
              implementations of the invariant method
practical for phylogenetic analysis.

                  The investigator develops better methods to construct
biological trees
              explaining the evolutionary relationships
between species.  Understanding
              evolutionary relationships is an
important biological question, whose
              applications range from
aiding the discovery of the origin of life to helping
              the medical
community research possible vaccines and treatments for
              pathogens
such as the H.I.V. virus.  It would be extremely useful to have
an
              accurate and computationally efficient method of phylogenetic
(or
              evolutionary) analysis, but no method is currently known to
possess both
              qualities.  The project seeks to improve the
accuracy of the tree
              reconstruction method using phylogenetic
invariants.  The method of invariants
              is a computationally
efficient method, which is known to theoretically give
              correct
answers.  However, in practice, the method is very susceptible to
the
              presence of noise in the data.  The investigator aims to
minimize this problem
              by eliminating several assumptions that
currently must be met to use the
              method of invariants.
