This collaborative proposal focuses on the creation and
              validation of a community based real-time and retrospective high-latitude
              ionospheric electrodynamics specification and forecasting tool.  At it's core,
              the tool will have the assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics
              (AMIE) technique.  The model will make predictions of the eletrodynamic state
              of the high-latitude ionosphere for up to 60 minutes ahead of time.  In
              addition, the PIs will make the code available to the community through a
              simple graphical user interface which will allow community members to run AMIE
              for their campaigns.

The creation of the predictive model will give
              fundamental insight into many non-steady-state magnetospheric processes, such
              as substroms and storms by allowing a quantitative examination of how the state
              of the magnetosphere and ionosphere are dependent both on the current state and
              the external driving conditions.

The PI's will perform a quantitative
              validation of AMIE and rtAMIE.  The validation will give average error
              estimates for each grid point on AMIE for the ionospheric potential and
              conductances.  These error estimates will be functions of: (1) location, (2)
              data density, (3) activity level, and (4)season.  This quantitative validation
              will allow users of the code to fully understand the accurarcy of the results. 
              No other electric potential model has this capability, even though it is
              crucially important for studies of ionospheric and magnetospheric phenomena.
