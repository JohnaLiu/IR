              PROJECT SUMMARY
This award provides partial support for the Gordon Conference
              on Glycobiology
scheduled for March 4-9, 2001 at the Sheraton Harbortown
              Resort, Ventura, CA. The
previous conference was held at the same venue on
              February 21-26, 1999. This was a highly
successful conference and, in keeping
              with earlier conferences, demand for places
outstripped supply and the 150
              delegate places were quickly filled. The Gordon Conference
on Glycobiology is
              the main venue for presentation and discussion of current and
              future
directions in the field of glycobiology. By bringing together
              scientists whose skills span
a wide range of disciplines including chemistry,
              cell biology, genetics, developmental
biology and bioinformatics, these
              conferences consistently lead to new insights, new
interactions, new
              collaborations, and new research directions.
The 2001 Glycobiology Gordon
              Conference will build on the successful
traditions of previous conferences
              whilst taking account of the many exciting new avenues
of glycobiological
              research which are being opened up by the information emanating from
Genome
              Projects. For example, once the amino acid sequences of the several
              hundred
thousand proteins that make up a human being are known, scientists
              will be faced with the
awesome challenge of understanding their functions and
              learning how post-translational
events such as glycosylation contribute to
              human health and disease. Glycobiologists will
play key roles in the
              post-genomics era and the 2001 Gordon Conference is well timed to
facilitate
              inter-disciplinary collaborations essential to the successful exploitation
              of
genomic information of relevance to glycobiology.
The main themes of the
              conference will be: (i) structural glycobiology with special
emphasis on
              technological developments and new information pertaining
              to
lectin-carbohydrate recognition; (ii) the impact of genomics on
              glycobiology; (iii)
discoveries from knockout mouse experiments; (iii)
              glyco-immunology; (iv) reproductive and
developmental glycobiology; (v)
              neuro-glycobiology; (vi) glycoconjugates as therapeutic
agents. Since
              glycopolymers are important in a wide range of biological and
              pathological
systems, this multi-disciplinary approach should appeal to a
              broad spectrum of
investigators.
