The investigators will determine variations in
              magnetic structure with height above the visible surface of the Sun. The main
              effort is to use the San Fernando Observatory Vacuum Telescope (SFOVT) to make
              a variety of observations of the photosphere and chromosphere at infrared
              wavelengths. Observations at infrared wavelengths of spectral lines formed at
              different altitudes will allow the investigators to make Zeeman magnetic field
              measurements. The investigators will perform a fractal analysis of the spatial
              structure of the magnetic field, and study the vertical extent of magnetic
              structures observed at low altitudes, the so-called moss. With high time
              resolution they will follow dynamic changes in magnetic fields prior to
              filament eruptions, and low-level outflows observed in coronal holes, possibly
              implying a low altitude source for solar wind. The proposed research will
              initiate a new direction for the SFOVT, utilizing a recently acquired, high
              performance infrared camera.
