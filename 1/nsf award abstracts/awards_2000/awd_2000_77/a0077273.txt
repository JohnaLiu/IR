Proposal Title: Solar Radio Noise and Its Effect On
              Wireless Communication

Principal Investigator: Dale Gary, NJIT 

The
              investigators will specify solar radio flux density levels and fluctuations as
              a function of frequency and as a function of solar cycle phase. The main effort
              is to analyze three datasets: (1) Fixed frequency radio burst measurements
              observations obtained over the past forty years from a network (RSTN) operated
              by the United States Air Force. (2) Data from the Phoenix-2 spectrometer
              operated by ETH in Zurich, Switzerland. (3) The solar radio burst locator at
              the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. The analysis will provide statistical
              measures of importance to designers of modern communications systems. The
              analysis will also determine whether an observed saturation of RSTN data on
              solar events at high flux density is instrumental in origin or is inherent to
              the physical process on the Sun. Result of this determination are of direct
              interest to solar physics.
