Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Florida State University will acquire a
              Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including the following: (1) polymerization of
              fluorinated monomers within thin sol-gel films to produce low-surface-energy
              polymers; b) investigations of the degradation mechanism of unique redox-active
              monolayers; and c) the use of optical waveguides bearing thin, chemically
              sensitive films for sensor applications. 

A Fourier transform infrared
              spectrometer is a veritable workhorse in the modern chemical laboratory and can
              provide important information about molecular and electronic structure. These
              studies on the chemistry at surfaces and thin films will have an impact on
              sensor development and materials science.
