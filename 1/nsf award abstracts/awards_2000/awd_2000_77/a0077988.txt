Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the East Carolina University
              will acquire a 300 MHz NMR and upgrade a 200 MHz NMR spectrometer. This
              equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) development of new
              reagents for the kinetic resolution of chiral alcohols; b) the study of a
              one-step stereoselective approach to polycyclic ring systems possessing
              multiple stereogenic centers as a model for biomimetic-like cyclization
              processes; c) studies of bleomycin-DNA binding; d) synthesis and coordination
              chemistry of new classes of macrocyclic ligands;and e) investigations of the
              rotational dynamics of fullerenes.   The upgraded instrument will also be used
              in a number of advanced laboratory courses.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry, catalysis, sensor
              development and medicine .
