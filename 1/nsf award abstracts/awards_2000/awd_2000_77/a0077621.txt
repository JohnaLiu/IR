Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona will upgrade
              a departmental gas-phase photoelectron spectrometer. This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including the following: a) studies of
              metal-metal interactions; b) electron transfer in organic compounds containing
              heteroatoms; c) evaluation of molybdenum-sulfur interactions in molybdoenzyme
              model complexes; and d) electronic structure of porphyrins and
              metalloporphyrins.  


The X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS)  is used
              for chemical analysis.  It irradiates a sample with a beam of monochromatic
              X-rays and the energies of the resulting photoelectrons are measured and
              related to specific elements.  XPS often plays a crucial role in defining the
              system under study.  The work to be carried out by these investigators
              represents a highly coherent attack on a range of issues at the forefront of
              materials chemistry and biology.
