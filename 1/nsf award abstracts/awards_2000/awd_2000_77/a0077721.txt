In July of 1998 a massive tsunami struck the north coast of
              Papua New Guinea, severely damaging four communities and killing thousands of
              villagers. This project will investigate the impact of the disaster and
              subsequent relief efforts on traditional social networks in the four coastal
              communities. These villages were linked by extensive social, economic, and
              ritual networks that were studied by the PI in previous research. One of the
              unanticipated consequences of international rehabilitation aid and NGO
              reconstruction following disasters is often the disruption and destruction of
              the local social networks that previously organized community social life; this
              has long-term implications for the viability of affected communities.The PI
              will analyze the extent to which these networks have been disrupted, altered,
              or maintained following the tsunami disaster Methods include participant
              observation, structured interviews, and the collection of oral narratives. The
              PI will work closely with officials and students from the Papua New Guinea
              National Museum and and the University of New Guinea. The project will
              contribute to our understanding of how communities and social networks respond
              to natural dissasters, and how aid efforts may unintentionally reshape
              communities; this has important policy implications for future relief
              efforts.
