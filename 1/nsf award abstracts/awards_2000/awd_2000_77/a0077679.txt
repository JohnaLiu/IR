Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Miami will
              acquire a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
              carry out studies on a) fullerene derivatives and the higher fullerenes; b)
              structural studies of alpha-aminoorganolithiums; c) natural products from
              marine algae; and d) novel redox self-assembling systems.   

Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules
              in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials
              chemistry.
