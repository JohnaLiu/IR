Abstract    :
              A Gordon Research Conference will be held July 9-14, 2000 on defects and
              defect-related phenomena in homogeneous and structured semiconductors,
              associated with growth and processing of electronic materials. Topics which are
              controversial and/or forward-looking will be emphasized. The program is
              organized around invited speakers, discussion leaders, a chair, vice-chair, and
              program committee; both contributed papers and posters are scheduled.
              Objectives are to stimulate communications among the broad community of
              researchers who address defects from a variety of disciplinary
              backgrounds--chemistry, physics, engineering and materials science, and to
              formulate and delineate critical research necessary to further basic
              understanding and move concepts closer to technological success. The conference
              is expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical scientific
              issues in the area of defects in semiconductors. Along with the opportunity to
              assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be
              established between universities, research institutions, and industry.

              An evaluation of the progress and status of defects and defect-related
              phenomena in semiconductors associated with growth and processing of electronic
              materials and device related structures along with current assessments of the
              most important developments in this field will be of great value to the
              understanding and enhanced utilization of materials in computing, data
              processing, and communications.
