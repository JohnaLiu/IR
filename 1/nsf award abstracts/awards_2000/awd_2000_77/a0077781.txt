Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Brigham Young University will
              upgrade a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
              carry out studies on a) the development of new glycosidase inhibitors; b)
              natural product and stereoselective synthesis; c) development of metal
              ion-selective macrocyclic chelators; d) elucidation of photochemical mechanisms
              and synthesis using photochemistry;e) preparation of pH responsive cavitands
              based on metal-calixarene interactions; f) structural elucidation of
              biologically active components of traditional medicines; g) development of
              novel nucleotides for antisense gene therapy; h) preparation of antiviral
              agents and elucidation of mechanisms of nucleoside processing enzymes; and i)
              development of permeabilizers of the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria.
                

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from
              these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including
              fundamental medicinal chemistry.
