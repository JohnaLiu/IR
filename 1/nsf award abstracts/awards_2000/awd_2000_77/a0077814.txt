Abstract    :
              This award is in partial support of a Gordon Conference on Research at high
              Pressures.  This conference is vital and important as high pressure research
              has changed dramatically over the years with the development of new techniques
              for generating pressure and studying samples at pressures which now extend into
              the multi-megabar range for static pressures, and substantially higher for
              shock pressure.  The conference serves as an important international forum for
              topics at the forefront of both static and dynamic pressures, in small volume
              diamond anvil cells and large volume presses, in the diverse fields of physics,
              chemistry, geosciences, and emerging topics in biology.  The upcoming meeting
              will feature invited talks in the most exciting subjects of recent interent,
              including efforts to understand and metallize hydrogen, the composition of the
              earth's core, novel materials, magnetism and superconductivity, shock on
              polyatomics, alkali metals, and new methods and techniques.  Opening and
              closing sessions will discuss the challenges of the future and celebrate the
              successes of the past.  This vibrant and successful conference will have
              representation from all fields and sectors, including new faces, graduate
              students, post docs, junior faculty and a strong representation from large
              active groups.
