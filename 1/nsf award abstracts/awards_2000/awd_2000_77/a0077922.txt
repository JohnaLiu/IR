Muscle spindles and tendon organs are muscle receptors
              important for the control of movement and posture.  Animals that lack muscle
              spindles cannot walk.  Preliminary studies have shown that numbers and
              structure of spindles and tendon organs are abnormal in the absence of a gene
              called 3r81.  The present project will address mechanisms whereby the er81 gene
              causes abnormalities of the muscle receptors.  Using genetically altered mice
              lacking er81, the project will examine how nerve fibers originating from
              sensory neurons located just outside the spinal cord are able to induce the
              formation of spindles and tendon organs in muscles, and connect the muscle
              receptors to appropriate motor neurons in the spinal cord so that they can
              function properly.

Trauma to peripheral nerve or spinal cord often results
              in disconnection of nerve fibers from their target organs.  This inability of
              injured nerve fibers to match with muscle receptors or spinal neurons hampers
              recovery of function during nerve regeneration.  A better understanding of the
              role of the er81 gene in the molecular processes that match nerve fibers with
              their targets may help to devise new restorative therapies for patients with
              peripheral nerve or spinal cord injuries.
