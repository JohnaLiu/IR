During embryonic development, cells destined to develop into
              discrete tissues must recognize and adhere to one another.  These adhesive
              events are mediate by proteins found on the surfaces of cells, on such family
              of which are the protocadherins.  Recently a novel protocadherin member, termed
              NFPC, was isolated from the frog, Xenopus laevis.  NFP is found in the
              developing frog nervous system in a subset of neurons in both the spinal cord
              and eye, implying that NFPC might mediate the adhesion and segregation of these
              neurons during development.  Accordingly this study will dissect the role of
              NFPC in the adhesive events responsible for correct development of these
              neurons.  As it is not known how protocadherins function as cell adhesion
              molecules, and whether they may have additional roles in cell signaling, the
              mechanism by which NFPC acdts will be investigated by isolating and analyzing
              the cytoplasmic factors with which it interadcts.  
Finally the roles of other
              novel protocadherins in vertebrate neural development will be
              assessed.
	Results from these studies will provide insights into the molecular
              mechanisms by which the vertebrate nervous system forms, as well as an
              elucidation of how protocadherins contribute to this process.  Thus, these
              studies will lead to a better understanding of how alterations in cell adhesion
              can contribute to the etiology of neural defects and cancer.
