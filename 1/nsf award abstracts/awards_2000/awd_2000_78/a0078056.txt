Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
              will acquire a MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including a) polymer synthesis using novel
              polymerization processes; b) de novo design of synthetic water-soluble and
              membrane-soluble proteins; c) preparation of polymers using photo- and electron
              beam initiated polymerizations; d) studies on the origin of life and formation
              of RNA from prebiotic molecules; and e) protein surface studies.  

Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
              to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
              and organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry, polymer processing
              and biology.
