Gynodioecy is a condition in plant populations in which
              hermaphroditic and female individuals coexist. It arises when a mutation
              (called a cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) factor) causes hermaphrodites to
              lose male function, with a concurrent increase in seed production.
              Understanding how gynodioecy persists is an ongoing question in the field of
              plant population biology. This project will combine molecular genetic markers
              and genetic crosses to ask how many different CMS factors exist in small
              natural populations of Silene vulgaris, and how those factors are distributed
              spatially. This will be combined with mathematical and computer models in order
              to understand how the extinction and recolonization of local populations
              influences the evolution of gynodioecy.

This project will be relevant to
              several broader scientific issues. First, CMS factors are an example of
              "selfish DNA". The studies of S. vulgaris will be one of the few to link
              molecular markers to selfish elements in nature. Second, the study of the
              genetics of small and fragmented populations is significant for conservation
              biology. This study of S. vulgaris will yield general information about genetic
              processes in small populations. Finally, gynodioecy is important for
              agriculture because it is used as a tool by plant breeders for increasing crop
              yield.
