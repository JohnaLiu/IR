Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
              Los Angeles will acquire a Gas Chromatograph-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer.
              This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a)
              development of new synthetic methods and total synthesis of biologically
              interesting natural products; b) studies on singlet oxygen chemistry; c)
              supramolecular and macromolecular chemistry; d) ubiquinone biochemistry; e)
              conducting polymers; and f) structural characterization of bioactive oxidized
              lipids and lipid second messengers of these phospholipids.  

Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
              to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
              and organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including biochemistry and materials science.
