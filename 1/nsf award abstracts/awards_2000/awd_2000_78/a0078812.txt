Abstract    :
              Michael Jackson of the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse is supported by a grant
              from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to investigate the high
              resolution absorption spectroscopy of a series of symmetric (fluromethane and
              phosphine) and asymmetric (sulfur dioxide, difluoroethylene, hydrazine and
              methanol) top molecules using far ir (FIR) Stark spectroscopy.  Analysis of the
              spectra will yield frequencies of the many spectroscopic transitions, molecular
              structural parameters and accurate electric dipoles.  In addition, measurements
              through the FIR region will give the rotational state dependence of
              doublet/inversion splitting and of the electric dipole moments.

Molecular
              spectroscopy provides a way of both detecting and identifying molecules
              remotely and of determining their fundamental internal properties.  This study
              extends the work into the infrared region of the spectrum where there are
              applications to molecule detection in interstellar space, planetary atmospheres
              and to laser science.
