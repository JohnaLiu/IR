Abstract    :
              The focus of this research has three parts.  First, polymers with functionalized
              cross-links and cyclopolymerized functional monomer units will be studied. 
              Second,  new linker strategies for synthesis, several of which reveal latent
              reactive functionality, will be developed and generalized.  Third, novel
              approaches to heterocycle synthesis employing C-C bond formation will be
              investigated.  Emphasis will be placed on applications of polymer chemistry
              that address synthetic problems which cannot be readily or as efficiently
              solved in other ways.

With this renewal award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Drs. Mark J.
              Kurth and Neil E. Schore of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              California-Davis.  Professors Kurth and Schore will focus their work on
              developing methodology for the preparation and evaluation of reactive polymer
              systems for use in organic synthesis.  The work has broader impacts for the
              training of graduate students and in the area of combinatorial chemistry.
