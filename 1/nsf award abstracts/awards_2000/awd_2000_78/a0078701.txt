Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research on the synthesis and characterization of new cluster
              compounds of the early transition metal elements W, Ta and Mo with chlorine
              ligands by Professor Louis Messerle of the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of Iowa. New, low temperature solid state and solution techniques
              are employed for the preparation of these complexes, as well as reactivity
              studies. Characterization is accomplished by means of X-ray diffraction, NMR,
              electrospray MS and UV-vis spectroscopy. The physical measurements are
              supported by molecular orbital calculations.

The goal of this research is to
              use low-temperature methods recently developed in the Principle Investigator's
              laboratory to synthesize new metal atom cluster compounds, and to determine
              their physical and chemical properties. These complexes will be useful for the
              production of many other organometallic and coordination compounds, and may
              they find applications as magnetic materials and in medical diagnostics as
              contrast agents. Many of the results of this work will be integrated into
              laboratory courses, and the undergraduate and graduate students involved in the
              project will learn a breadth of skills in both synthesis and instrumental
              methods as well as gain experience in an effort which links fundamental
              chemistry with medical and material applications.
