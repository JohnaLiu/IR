This award supports Dana Garcia of Southwest Texas State
              University in a collaboration with Jurgen Markl of the Institute of Zoology at
              the University of Mainz, Germany.  The project will focus on the role of
              intermediate filaments in pigment granules movements in retinal pigment
              epithelium of teleost fishes.  Such movements are associated with changes in
              light conditions.  The U.S. expertise and facilities are complemented by those
              in the German lab, which is a leader in this area of research.  The German
              group uses a variety of techniques, including molecular biological,
              biophysical, and biochemical ones as well as cell biology to evaluate the
              characteristics of the filaments under study, and the German laboratory offers
              facilities not available at Southwest Texas State.  Together, the U.S. and
              German groups will be able to make advances in this important field that would
              not be possible by either side alone.
