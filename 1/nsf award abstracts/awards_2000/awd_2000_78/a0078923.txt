Abstract    :
              This project seeks to dramatically expand the repertoire of self replicating
              peptides into new peptide motifs, including systems with the potential for
              conditional selection.  The problem of product inhibition will be addressed
              through the use of environmental cycling and beta-sheet motifs.  Specific
              questions to be addressed include the limitations on structural motifs that are
              amenable to self-replication and the minimization of product
              inhibition.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program's Organic Synthesis Program supports the research of Professor Jean A.
              Chmielewski of Purdue University.  Professor Chmielewski studies the
              self-replication of peptides by analogy with similar work in the area of DNA
              self-replication that has contributed significantly to the development of
              biotechnology.  Application of self-replication in proteins could afford
              similar advances in biotechnology.
