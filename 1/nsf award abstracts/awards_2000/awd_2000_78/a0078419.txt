Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              planar magnetic levitator/positioner for precision microelectronics
              manufacturing equipment.  Based on feasibility proven in Phase I, Phase II will
              design, construct, and test a minimum-actuator maglev stage that can be readily
              integrated in a process tool.  A single-moving maglev platen will be driven in
              all six degrees of freedom with three levitation motors.  The platen will
              generate large two-dimensional motions for transportation with small four-axis
              motions for alignment and small adjustments.  It will lead to a clean-room
              compatible, lightweight, compact, inexpensive structure that can meet demanding
              dynamic performance requirements in next-generation precision microelectronics
              manufacturing.

Magnetic levitation has many potential applications in
              microelectronics manufacturing equipment that require precise planar position
              control, such as wafer steppers, wafer handlers, wire bonders, surface
              profilometers, scanned probe microscopes, and precision inspection machines. 
              This technology is expected to figure prominently in the highly competitive
              microelectronics manufacturing capital equipment industry.
