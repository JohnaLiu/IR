Flowers give rise to fruits and seeds, which include all
              cereals, and thereby provide the majority of calories consumed by humans.
              Understanding the mechanisms of flower development is therefore interesting
              both from a scientific and from an agronomic point of view. 

Early flower
              development is regulated by a cascade of regulatory genes that include
              flowering-time genes, meristem-identity genes and homeotic organ-identity
              genes. Most of these genes encode transcription factors, and some progress has
              been made in understanding the genetic and molecular interactions between these
              groups of genes. However, less is known about the downstream effectors of
              floral homeotic genes. 
Dr. Weigel is studying the UFO gene, which regulates
              several aspects of flower development in Arabidopsis. In contrast to many other
              floral control genes, UFO does not encode a transcription factor. Instead, UFO
              encodes an F-box protein that is likely to affect the stability of other
              regulatory proteins. Dr. Weigel has shown that UFO acts as an F-box protein in
              vivo, and that it functions downstream of the homeotic gene AP1 in the
              formation of petals.

He now proposes genetic, molecular and biochemical
              approaches (1) to determine whether UFO function is required in all cell layers
              to promote petal growth; (2) to determine how UFO expression in petals is
              controlled, with emphasis on the role of the homeotic gene AP1 in this process;
              (3) to identify proteins that interact with UFO in vivo and mediate its
              effects; and (4) to identify new genes that act with UFO in petal
              formation.

The proposed work will advance our understanding of the
              mechanisms by which F-box proteins affect plant growth and development.
              Furthering our knowledge of plant development in turn will enhance our ability
              to improve growth and yield of crop plants.
