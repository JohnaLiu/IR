Abstract    :
              This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) award to Professor Peter
              Geissinger of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division. The project
              targets two specific and important areas of analytical chemistry; development
              of a sensitive and rapid detection scheme for a sensor array and an
              identification strategy to determine the active components in a combinatorial
              library. The research uses a novel approach of segmenting an optical fiber into
              regions that are used in a parallel synthesis scheme. Reactants, along with a
              fluorophore are added to each fiber segment. Upon excitation with a laser
              pulse, the evanescent excitation of the fluorophore is detected. The position
              of the fluorophore is calculated by the time difference between the pulse and
              the return signal. The position of each compound is known from the synthetic
              scheme. This allows the active components of the library to be quickly
              identified.  

Combinatorial chemistry libraries are becoming increasingly
              important in synthesis of new chemicals.  Accurate and rapid identification of
              the active species in the library is essential for the optimal use of the
              library. This project focuses on developing an alternative technique for
              preparing and screening libraries. This allows quick and economical 
              identification of  species that might be effective in applications such as
              pharmaceuticals.
