Abstract    :
              With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program of the
              Division of Chemistry and the Japan Program of the Division of International
              Programs support the Paul J. Scheuer Symposium on Marine Natural Products
              Chemistry.  The symposium will bring together junior and senior chemists
              interested in the broad area of marine natural products chemistry at the 2000
              International Chemical Conference of Pacific Basin Societies which will be held
              in Honolulu, Hawaii during December 14-19, 2000.  Speakers  reflect a wide
              variety of subfields within marine natural products chemistry, such as
              microbial diversity, chemical ecology, anticancer marine natural products, and
              synthetic studies on marine natural products.  In addition, speakers will
              discuss their vision of the field of marine natural products as the new
              millenium opens.
