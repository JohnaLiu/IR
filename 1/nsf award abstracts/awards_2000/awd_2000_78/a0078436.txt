Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research on the development of polyoxoanion-based dioxygenase
              catalysts by Professor Richard Finke of the Department of Chemistry at the
              Colorado State University. A specific focus is the development of  new, more
              robust and longer lifetime dioxygenase catalysts using oxidation-resistant
              polyoxyanions. The approach involves the performance of kinetic and mechanistic
              studies of the polyoxoanion-to -dioxygenase catalyst evolution process,
              isolation and performance of compositional and structural characterization on
              the true active catalyst, and then the use of the isolated catalyst to extend
              its applicability to additional classes of reactions for which efficient
              catalysts do not presently exist.

The goal of this research is to develop
              new catalysts which can directly utilize dioxygen to oxidize a wide variety of
              aromatics, olefins and alkanes of commercial importance. These catalysts will
              have  a significant economic and environmental impact due to their ability to
              replace current co-oxidation processes and to their potential applications in
              the degredation of aromatic pollutants. The students involved in this project
              will receive broad training in analytical, inorganic and materials chemistry
              and leave them well-prepared for academic or industrial careers.
