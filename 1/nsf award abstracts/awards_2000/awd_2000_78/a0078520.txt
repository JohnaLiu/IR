Abstract    :
              This project, sponsored by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
              develops materials and methods for chemically selective extraction without the
              need for volatile solvents.  The research, conducted by Dr.Stephen G. Weber and
              his students at the University of Pittsburgh, develops novel fluorous membranes
              and films on which a fluoropolymer supports a fluorous nonvolatile solvent.
              Membranes are prepared from Teflon (TM) AF2400, and five plasticizers to form
              the supported fluorous phases. These supported phases are doped with molecular
              recognition receptors that allow the fluorous phases to be highly selective for
              extraction of  various target species. Partitioning experiments and infrared
              spectroscopic measurements are used to quantitate the influence of a particular
              functional group on partitioning into the fluorous phase.  The results of these
              experiments are used to guide the design of artificial receptors and to develop
              libraries of receptors.  

The results from this project could have far
              ranging effects when fully utilized. Potential applications include improved
              chemical analysis for pharmaceuticals, reduced energy comsumption in some
              industries, and a reduction in waste from sample processing in analytical
              laboratories.
