Abstract    :
              The Fast Auroral SnapshoT (FAST) satellite has shown that one of the most
              energetic wave phenomena in the ionosphere and magnetosphere are structures
              characterized by holes in the phase-space density of electrons.  This project
              will utilize a new three-dimensional kinetic particle simulation code to
              investigate the fundamental physics of these phase space holes.  Five major
              questions will be investigated: (1) What are the conditions under which these
              holes are formed, (2) why do simulations indicate that the structures are
              unstable and what is the implication of this result to the FAST satellite
              measurements, (3) how do the holes generate whistler waves, (4) how do the
              electron holes interact with the ions, and (5) what role (if any) do these
              holes play in the large scale electrodynamics of the auroral electrojet.
