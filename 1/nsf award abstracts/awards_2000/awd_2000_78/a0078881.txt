Abstract    :
              In this project, a variety of functional group transformations such as cleavage
              of epoxides, rearrangement of epoxides to carbonyl compounds and cyclization of
              epoxy-polyenes will be attempted using various bismuth compounds.  These
              reactions will exploit the Lewis acidity of several bismuth(III) compounds as
              well as the oxidizing power of bismuth(V) reagents.  In light of increased
              awareness of environmental issues and the low toxicity of bismuth compounds,
              the successful completion of this project will make a significant contribution
              to this end.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program's Organic Synthesis Program supports the research of Professor Ram S.
              Mohan of Illinois Wesleyan University.  Professor Mohan and his undergraduate
              students of chemistry will undertake a systematic investigation of the
              applications of bismuth compounds in synthetic organic chemistry.  Bismuth
              compounds are attractive candidates for use as reagents in organic synthesis
              because of their low toxicity and ready availability at low cost.
