Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop and
              demonstrate
a laboratory prototype of the Advanced Positron Beam Source (APBS)
              that will
provide a high quality pulsed positron beam suitable for a range of
              analytical
instruments for materials science. The project extends the latest
              developments
in techniques to accumulate positrons from a radioactive source
              in Penning traps.
The technical objectives of the Phase I project were fully
              achieved. The technical
objectives of Phase II are: (1) to develop a compact,
              low-cost, two-stage positron
trap; (2) to develop an advanced cryogenic
              positron moderator system; (3) to
develop a high- performance positron
              buncher; (4) to refine the Phase I approach
for extracting positrons from the
              magnetic field of the trap; and (5) to assemble
and demonstrate the APBS
              system. If successful, this project will provide the
basis for
              commercialization of the APBS in Phase III. 
A major obstacle to the
              commercial exploitation of positron-based surface analytical techniques
has
              been the lack of a suitable slow positron beam source. The APBS will fill this
              need
by providing a compact, low-cost, user-friendly positron beam source that
              can
function ultimately as a turnkey system in an industrial environment. The
              APBS
will have advanced performance characteristics that are not available
              from any
other system.
