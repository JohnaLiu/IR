Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project deals with the
              fabrication of
ultra high strength Polymer/Metal Multi-layers (PML)
              nanolaminates.  In Phase I, Sigma Technologies has demonstrated that the
              Aluminum/Polymer nanolaminates have distinctive advantages over Aluminum, (a) a
              superior tensile strength (over 3 fold in some cases), (b) and a lower density.
               Furthermore, Sigma has developed, based on experimental results, a numerical
              model to predict the tensile strength of multilayer
composites.  The
              attractive features of the PML composites have generated a significant interest
              in this product by a major aerospace and avionics OEM (Original Equipment
              Manufacturer.   Additional functionality of this composite includes ultra-high
              gas and vapor barrier, high electrical conductivity, electromagnetic shielding,
              preferential heat conductivity that is useful for low observable applications,
              and structural self-monitoring characteristics.

In Phase II, Sigma will
              further optimize the properties of the PML composites and upgrade equipment
              that is already in place to produce 7ft x 4ft PML panels.  Parts will be tested
              independently by Sigma and its industrial and university partners.  Market
              research has shown that several applications may be served by the
              multifunctional structural PML composites.  Sigma will follow a systematic plan
              to identify niche markets and supply samples for evaluation.
