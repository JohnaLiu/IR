Abstract    :
              Full scale, three dimensional numerical simulation of high intensity particle
              and laser beam-matter interactions are undertaken to explore novel plasma
              phenomena.  The research develops new algorithms, employs state-of-the-art
              numerical methods and uses these on the latest massively parallel computers. 
              The training of students in the development of modern computing techniques is a
              major goal of the research.
