              Abstract
In eukaryotes, MSLH systems composed of homologs of prokaryotic MutS
              proteins and of MutL proteins mediate critical genomic stability functions.
              Plants encode several MSH proteins whose activities would appear needed to
              prevent accumulation of replication-error and environmentally induced mutations
              during the many divisions of apical meristem cells that precede differentiation
              into gamete-producing tissues and to ensure accurate and productive meiosis.
              The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To investigate  special properties
              of Arabidopsis MSH7 protein. DNA substrate specificities of atMsh7.atMsh2 vs
              atMsh6.atMsh2 protein heterodimers and the steady-state levels of atMSH7 mRNA
              vs levels expressed by other Arabidopsis MSH and MLH genes in vegetative and
              putative germ-line tissues will be compared. 2) To analyze MSLH protein roles
              in prevention of mitotic DNA replication errors and UV mutagensis. 3) To study
              MSLH protein functins in plant meiosis. 

Plants are of necessity exposed to
              sunlight and consequently must have effective DNA repair systems. This work
              should produce results that will add to our knowledge base but will also be of
              value to plant breeders and to individuals seeking to genetically engineer
              plants and to propagate plant cells in culture.
