This project will investigate the factors
              responsible for higher than average blood pressures among populations of
              African descent. While it is commonly assumed that there is a racial-genetic
              predisposition for high blood pressure among these groups, this project will
              evaluate social and cultural factors that may promote high blood pressure.
              Darker skin color is often associated with lower social and economic status,
              factors that promote chronic stress and sustained high blood pressure. The
              researcher will isolate the effects of skin color as a phenotype and skin color
              as a criterion of social status in Puerto Rico where social ascriptions of 
              "color" (and thus social status) do not necessarily coincide with phenotypic
              race. Methods include participant observation, intensive interviewing and
              structured elicitation techniques among samples of Puerto Ricans. The study
              will contribute to our understanding of "racial" and "cultural" differences in
              health.
