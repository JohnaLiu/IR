     In several branches of science and technology, one
              like
would like to imitate nature's success at designing networks that
can
              synchronize themselves.  For instance, a semiconductor laser
array generates
              greater collective power when it synchronizes,
but such phase-locked operation
              is notoriously difficult to
achieve in practice.  The investigator studies the
              nonlinear
dynamics of oscillator networks, using mathematical methods
              of
dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, and statistical
mechanics,
              along with numerical simulation.  Three projects
explore how synchrony emerges
              in a group of dissimilar
oscillators, motivated by both biological and laser
              applications.
Areas of investigation include the stability of partial
              locking
in the Kuramoto model of coupled biological oscillators; the
dynamics
              of biological oscillators coupled by phase-response
curves; and phase-locking
              in slightly detuned laser arrays.  Two
other projects address the relation
              between the connectivity of a
network and its ability to synchronize. 
              Small-world networks,
which combine small diameter with large clustering,
              are
investigated to test whether they synchronize more readily
              than
lattices.
     The goal of this project is to develop a
              deeper
understanding of complex systems that are made of many
oscillating
              parts and that manage to synchronize themselves.  For
instance, the thousands
              of pacemaker cells in the heart always
fire in unison, even though they are
              all slightly different from
one another.  Unfortunately, a similar kind of
              coordination
sometimes happens in the brain, where it leads to epilepsy. 
              In
both cases, nature has provided us with examples in which
millions of
              cells begin to act in unison.  By understanding
better how this synchrony is
              achieved, it should be possible to
design arrays of technologically important
              devices that can
synchronize themselves.  Such self-synchronizing systems
              would
have important technological applications in many areas of
national
              interest, including environment (atmospheric pollution
monitoring uses
              sensitive detectors based on arrays of
oscillators), civil infrastructure (the
              proper functioning of the
national power grid depends on self-synchronization
              of the
generator network), and nanotechnology (where arrays of millions
of
              microscopic mechanical oscillators are being used in new
devices).
