Abstract    :
              This travel grant will provide funds that will facilitate travel for young
              academic scientists from U.S. institutions to attend the 'Frontiers in
              Macromolecular Science in the 21st Century' conference to be held at the ACS
              Meeting in San Francisco, CA on March 26-30, 2000.  This symposium specifically
              deals with research focus at the dawn of the new millennium, and diverse topics
              were chosen to provide a comprehensive vision of future research in academia
              and industry.
