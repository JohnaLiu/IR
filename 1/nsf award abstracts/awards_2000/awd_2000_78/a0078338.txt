Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon in
              Eugene will acquire an ultrafast tunable laser source. This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including a) vibrational spectroscopic
              measurements at liquid surfaces; b) self-assembly of inorganic/organic
              multilayer thin films; c) pump/probe studies of cage effects in organometallic
              radical chemistry; and d) carbon-rich networks and materials based on
              dehydrobenzoannulenes.   

Ultrafast spectroscopy allow scientists to
              investigate chemistry that occurs in the picosecond (10^-12) and femtosecond
              (10^-15) time regimes.  On these extremely short timescales, atoms move and
              bonds between atoms are broken or formed.  Ultrafast optical techniques allow
              for the investigation of chemical reaction dynamics during the course of the
              reaction itself.  The detailed picture of chemical reactivity provided by
              ultrafast spectroscopy has allowed researchers to explore how plants harvest
              solar energy, to create new and more efficient optoelectronic materials, and to
              understand the fundamental steps in many environmental processes.  In short,
              ultrafast spectroscopy holds the promise of unraveling the microscopic details
              of chemical reactivity.
