Abstract    :
              The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) promotes, administers,
              and provides support services for the conference series known as the NSF/CBMS
              Regional Research Conferences in Mathematics.  These conferences have been an
              ongoing cooperative project administered by CBMS and supported by NSF
              continuously since 1969. Proposals for grants for individual conferences are
              made by prospective host institutions directly to NSF and those conferences
              chosen for funding are selected by a national review panel appointed by NSF and
              CBMS. Each conference features a distinguished lecturer who delivers ten
              lectures over a five day period on a topic of important current research in one
              sharply focused area of the mathematical sciences. The organizer of each
              conference invites other established researchers in the field and interested
              newcomers, including graduate students and post doctoral fellows, to
              participate in the conference. The lecturer prepares a substantial expository
              monograph based upon his or her lectures, which is then published by one of the
              following professional societies: the American Mathematical Society, the
              Society for
Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly, the American
              Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.
