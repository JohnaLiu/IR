Abstract    :
              This research project addresses the detailed dynamics of photoinduced reactions
              at well-characterized solid surfaces.  Using angle resolved time-of-flight
              measurements, Professor Ian Harrison and his students at the University of
              Virginia are exploring the photoactivation of adsorbates such as N2, CO2, and
              methane.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program this
              work provides detailed insight into the mechanisms of small molecule activation
              at surfaces, with strong implications for the development and improvement of
              heterogeneous catalytic methods.  Charge transfer excitation of these adsorbed
              molecules followed by analysis of the desorbed products, allows this group to
              probe the details of the transition state for photostimulated as well as
              thermally stimulated surface reactions.  

The photoexcitation of adsorbed
              molecules can be used to probe the dynamics of more common thermally activated
              processes on surfaces.  This research project uses fast laser excitation of
              adsorbates, followed by angle resolved measurements of product velocities to
              provide information about the detailed dynamics of several important small
              molecule reactions on well-characterized surfaces.  The results of these
              photodynamic studies are then applied to the understanding of the mechanisms of
              thermally activated catalytic reactions of considerable importance.
