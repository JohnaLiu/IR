Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project's objective is
              to provide oxide coatings that resist deterioration in a high-temperature
              oxidizing environment. A new, innovative process is will be developed that
              should form strongly-adherent, high-temperature, oxidation resistant coatings
              on steel alloys, iron and nickel superalloys, aluminides, and superalloy matrix
              composites. Using this process in Phase I, Alger Stirling Company (ASC)
              alpha-Al2O3 as well as ASC alpha-Al2O3/Ti2O3 protective coatings, whose
              coating-to-substrate bond strength was measured to be in excess of 10,000 psi,
              were formed on six different aluminum-containing and
              aluminum-and-titanium-containing alloy substrates.  Phase II testing (1) will
              optimize oxide thickness to provide maximum oxide/substrate bond strength, and
              (2) perform lifetime testing of the oxidized specimens in a high-temperature
              oxidizing environment. 

These coatings have broad application in industry
              throughout the nation. Products that utilize the ASC coatings can achieve
              longer lifetimes because of the surface protection provided by the coatings.
              Such longer lifetime translate directly to user dollar savings that are, first
              of all, a benefit to the entire nation and, second, make the products more
              competitive in foreign markets.
