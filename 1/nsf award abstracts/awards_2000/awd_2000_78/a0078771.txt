Abstract    :
              Professor William Taylor of the University of Central Arkansas is supported by
              the Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental studies on
              metal ions complexed with hydrocarbons in the gas phase.  Transition metals are
              frequently used as catalysts for activating hydrocarbons, but it is not
              understood how reactivity depends on the electronic state of the metal.  This
              proposal seeks to study the reactivity of several late first-, second- and
              third-row transition metal ions with small hydrocarbons as a function of
              electronic excitation of the metal.  Low energy ion drift cell and electronic
              state chromatographic methods will be used to study reactive systems such as
              platinum ion and methane.  A successful outcome of this proposal would be a
              model of transition metal reactivity that would allow better catalysts to be
              designed.  Important issues in this model include considerations of electron
              configuration and conservation of electron spin. New results from the larger
              metals proposed will be interpreted in the light of the PI's previous results
              on first row chemistry.

Transition metal ions have the ability to break
              sigma bonds, and this property is most useful in converting hydrocarbons to
              other compounds.  Understanding the mechanism of this process will allow design
              of new and better catalysts for use in chemical synthesis and the petroleum
              industry.
