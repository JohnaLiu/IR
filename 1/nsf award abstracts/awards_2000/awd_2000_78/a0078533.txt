Abstract    :
              Maria Szczesniak-Bryant and Grzegorz Chalasinski of Oakland University are
              supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program
              to study, using ab initio theory, the effect of the long-range region of
              potential energy surfaces on chemical reactions.  The specific reactions that
              are to be studied are those of chlorine atoms with hydrogen molecules and
              hydrogen chloride and hydroxyl radicals with hydrogen molecules.  This
              variously includes open-shell atoms and open and closed shell diatomic
              molecules, in the open shell cases involving multiple surfaces.  The influence
              of the different components of the interaction energy (electrostatic, exchange,
              induction and dispersion) will be investigated to determine the physical origin
              of the interactions and to understand the influence of the early stages of a
              chemical reaction on the overall reactivity.

The way chemicals react is
              controlled by the energy of the interaction between the reacting species, and
              between the product species, and thus is of general importance to much of
              chemistry.  Here the interaction at large distances will be explored
              theoretically to determine its influence on the overall reactivity by orienting
              the species or trapping them prior to overcoming barriers.
