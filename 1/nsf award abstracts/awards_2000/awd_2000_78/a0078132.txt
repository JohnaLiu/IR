The project will investigate the mechanism by which the
              Drosophila Smad proteins Mad and Medea override transcriptional repression by
              brinker (brk).  In response to Dpp signaling, Mad/Med repress brk expression,
              but also directly activate target genes such as vestigial, apparently in
              parallel to repression by Brk protein.  Band shift and Dnase I footprinting
              experiments will be used to identify Brk binding sites within Dpp response
              elements and to determine how these are positioned with respect to previously
              characterized Mad/Med binding sites.  Brk binding affinity and reporter
              analyses will be used to compare short- and long-range Dpp response elements
              and to determine how Brk contributes to the varying response thresholds of Dpp
              targets.  Gel shift experiments with extracts from transfected S2 cells will be
              used to determine whether Mad/Med complexes compete with Brk for binding to
              DNA.  Mad-Brk interaction will be investigated by means of
              co-immunoprecipitation and 2-hybrid analysis to determine whether direct
              contact with Brk protein is required for activated Smad complexes to override
              repression by Brk.  Similar experiments will be performed to investigate the
              role of Schnurri as a Mad cofactor in the repression of brk, wingless and other
              genes that respond negatively to Dpp signaling.
