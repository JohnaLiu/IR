Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue research
              and development of the Digital Cadaver Environment -- software that makes
              available to students multiple views of virtual cadavers with improved visual
              quality of the computed image, an increase in the size and attributes of the
              data sets used for rendering images, support for automatic configuration of
              imaging parameter using heuristics, and support for interpolation of missing
              sections of a user stain document.  Marking a unique approach to the
              application of computer technology to the undergraduate anatomy and physiology
              curriculum, this environment supports an interactive work model where students
              engage in the cycle of observation, interpretation, and action that
              characterizes the historic "dissect & sketch" paradigm.  The Digital Cadaver
              environment allows students to produce an individual and unique record of their
              investigations.  The Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of implementing the
              core functionality of the environment as a Java application and produced a beta
              version of the software.  Phase II of the research will focus on research
              extending this development in four areas: 1) Tools for collaboration between
              students will be created, and an intuitive project management system
              implemented for managing collections of images and documents; 2) Imagery from
              Visible Productions will be introduced into the environment to overcome defects
              in the Visible Human (VH) data sets; these images may also serve as links to
              other content, such as animations, photographs, or other images and documents
              that serve to augment the current environment; 3) tools will be expanded to
              include volume rendering of images in all viewing planes (i.e., sagittal,
              coronal, and axial) and arbitrary slicing of any image set; the data sets
              available to the student will be expanded to include selected cryosections of
              the female VH data set and selected MRI (magnetic resonance imagery) and CT
              (computerized tomography) imagery from the male and female; and 4) on the
              server, a more sophisticated illumination model will be implemented for added
              realism, user selectable image display properties will be included (i.e.,
              setting some tissue layers to transparent), and higher resolution images will
              be used; improved support for higher resolution images will complete the
              Digital Cadaver Immersive Environment.

The Digital Cadaver Environment
              enables a wider range of people to gain greater competencies in human anatomy
              and physiology.  These competencies may translate into better health care,
              wellness initiatives, and improved research outcomes.  The use of the National
              Library of Medicine's Visible Human Project in the creation of new
              instructional tools for the health professions offers a good public policy
              model of government/industry collaboration.
