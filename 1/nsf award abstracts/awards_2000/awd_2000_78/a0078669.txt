Abstract    :
              The goals of this study are to improve fundamental understanding of the physical
              and chemical processes that occur on the walls of low-temperature plasma
              systems and to develop an understanding of how these wall processes feed back
              to the plasma chemistry and influence the basic properties of the glow. 
              Experimental and computational investigations are combined to address these
              issues.  Measurements of fundamental parameters of plasmas are made in a
              modified Gaseous Electronics Conference (GEC) reference cell and compared with
              results from a comprehensive plasma equipment simulator, the Hybrid Plasma
              Equipment Model (HPEM).  The emphasis is on processes occurring on chamber
              walls and their influence on the overall discharge.  Diagnostics used include
              Langmuir probe measurements, microwave interferometry, Fourier-transform
              infrared (FTIR) spectrometry, mass and energy analysis, optical emission
              spectrometry (OES), and surface reflection techniques.

Interactions between
              working gases and the walls that contain them occur in all terrestrial
              low-pressure plasmas such as those used for semiconductor processing, lighting,
              and lasers.  These interactions can determine the basic parameters of the glow,
              but have received little direct study.  This work will provide a basis for a
              rational approach to the design, cleaning, or "seasoning" of plasma chambers.
