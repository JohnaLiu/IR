Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Sciences for fiscal year 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area
              of population biology and is entitled, " Examining riverbank restricted plants
              to determine if there is a pattern of genetic diversity coinciding with the
              structure of the
watershed."  Riparian plants may periodically be scoured out
              by seasonal floodwaters.  Plant populations high in the watershed are less
              influenced by stochastic effects and may provide a source of migrants to
              recolonize regions downstream. This research compares genetic structure to
              spatial structure of the populations and estimates the relative importance of
              migration, founder effects and genetic drift.  This study illustrates the
              potential role of population genetic structure for management efforts in
              terrestrial riparian corridors.
