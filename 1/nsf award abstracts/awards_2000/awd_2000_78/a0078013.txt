Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the relationship between social behavior and
              genetic relatedness in the Sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). This
              species serves as a model system for the analysis of mate choice in animals
              because breeding takes place at easily observed "leks", arenas of males visited
              by females for mating. The project has the following specific objectives: (i)
              determining relationships between male breeding behavior and reproductive
              success, (ii) identifying factors affecting mating patterns of females, and
              (iii) surveying patterns of genetic relatedness within and across social
              groups. This research combines field studies of the behavior of marked
              individual birds with measurement of paternity of offspring and relatedness
              among adults by genetic analysis of blood samples in the laboratory.

Past
              studies of the sage grouse lek system have been influential in shaping current
              understanding of mate choice in animals, a topic of central importance in
              evolutionary biology. However, earlier studies were based entirely on
              observable mating behavior, which may represent as little as half of all
              breeding activity in this species. The proposed genetic analyses should reveal
              mating patterns regardless of their observability and therefore have the
              potential to substantially revise our understanding of mate choice in this
              model system.
