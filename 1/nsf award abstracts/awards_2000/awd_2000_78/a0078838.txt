Abstract    :
              This award, jointly funded by the Divisions of Chemistry and Chemical and
              Transport Systems, renews support to the Board on Chemical Sciences and
              Technology of the National Academy of Sciences. The Board provides independent,
              objective advice to the government about chemical sciences and technologies. It
              carries out peer reviewed studies, organizes workshops, symposia and seminars,
              and serves as liaison to the community of experts who perform its work. Support
              of core activities of the Board also ensures that the chemical sciences
              community will have a credible and independent voice speaking to government,
              academia and the private sector.
