Funds from this proposal make possible a symposium on the
              evolution of developmental mechanisms in insects, to be held at the XXI
              International Congress of Entomology in Iguasu Falls, Brazil (20-26 August,
              2000). Insect research has contributed enormously to our current understanding
              of both developmental and evolutionary biology.  Recently, much of the
              ground-breaking work at the interface between these two fields has come from
              studies of insects.  Yet there has never been a symposium at any major
              conference dedicated the evolution of developmental mechanisms in insects.
              Since our symposium will be part of the largest entomological gathering in the
              world, the PIs have the unique opportunity to harness a tremendous breadth of
              biological expertise in insect science towards a more complete and satisfying
              unification of evolutionary and developmental biology.  They bring together
              investigators from around the world, but bias our participant list towards
              young investigators who are in the process of establishing lifetime
research
              programs that explicitly integrate developmental with evolutionary biology. 
              Their invited speakers use the powerful tools of developmental and molecular
              biology to test specific evolutionary questions in related species.  This
              approach has historical precedent as a useful method of forging a meaningful
              synthesis between developmental and evolutionary biology.  They anticipate that
              interactions derived from this symposium will establish new collaborations and
              reveal novel directions for future integrative entomological research.
