Abstract    :
              Dr. Ian P. Rothwell, Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, is supported by
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, for research into early transition metal aryloxide
              chemistry. The central theme of the project involves the use of sterically
              bulky aryloxide ligation to support both stiochiometeric and catalytic
              reactivity of unsaturated small molecules at transition metal centers. Studies
              will aim toward a mechanistic understanding of titanium-aryloxide catalyzed
              [2+2+1] acetylene trimerization and the development of the synthetic utility of
              the reaction. New C2 symmetric, chiral aryloxides will be used as monodentate
              supporting ligands to carry out asymmetric carbon-carbon bond forming
              reactions. Fundamental studies of the factors controlling both kinetic and
              thermodynamic resolution of the chiral species will be carried out. Finally,
              cationic metallacyclic niobium and tantalum complexes will be prepared.
              

Sterically bulky groups bound to transition metals are often effective in  
              preventing reactants of certain size and shape from accessing the metal  
              center.  As a consequence, the reactions that do occur produce products with a
              preferred geometry.  In this study, bulky alkoxide groups will be used to
              effect stereospecific reactivity to some early transition metal promoted
              reactions of utility in the synthesis of organic compounds.
