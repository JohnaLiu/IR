Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in the
              development of a prototype flywheel energy storage system (FESS) utilizing the
              innovative passive, non-contacting bearing developed in the Phase I project. 
              This new type of passive magnetic support and damping (PMSD) system consists of
              integrated stiffness and damping elements in a configuration that overcomes the
              most significant problems of previous systems.  The new bearing technology will
              result in a more efficient, more reliable, and less expensive FESS than is
              currently available.  The resulting FESS will facilitate the use of alternative
              energy systems in remote and/or hostile environments.  Phase II efforts will
              focus on 2 objectives: (1) The refinement and experimental validation of design
              equations predictive of PMSD performance; and (2) The development,
              installation, and testing of PMSD systems in a prototype FESS.  The FESS system
              for the prototype will be a commercial unit provided by the commercialization
              partner, and modified to accommodate the new technology.  The partner currently
              manufactures FESS for commercial power quality and uninterruptible power
              supplies applications.  Follow-on funding commitments and other agreements have
              been secured from the Alaska Science and Technology Foundation and from the
              commercialization partner to pursue additional technical work and for Phase III
              commercialization.  

In addition to providing storage for alternative energy
              systems, there are numerous commercial applications for FESS incorporating the
              PMSD technology including utility load leveling and uninterruptible power
              supplies (UPS).  The commercialization partner expects that the combination of
              technical and cost advantages demonstrated in Phase I would enable rapid market
              acceptance and encourage application of FESS in new markets.  The PMSD
              technology is also applicable to turbo-molecular pumps (TMPs).  These are used
              in the manufacture of silicon chips and in scientific instrumentation requiring
              high vacuums.  Predicted market penetration into these areas is in excess of
              18,000 units per year by 2005 and in excess of 30,000 units per year by 2009.
