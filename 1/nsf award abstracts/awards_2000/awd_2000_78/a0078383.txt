     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              will investigate the use of
redox catalyst electrodes for the synthesis of
              hydrogen peroxide through electrochemical
regeneration of the redox catalyst. 
              In the Phase I research, catalysts were developed and
their short-term
              stability for peroxide synthesis was successfully demonstrated. Flow
              cell
operation with 10 cm2 electrode cells showed the preparation of hydrogen
              peroxide in
acidic condition (1N H2SO4) at 60% current efficiency and up to 2%
              in peroxide
concentration.  However, Phase I work indicated poor catalytic
              current with oxygen for
these redox systems, as well as an upper limit for
              hydrogen peroxide concentration (2%).
Phase II research effort will be
              directed towards improving the catalytic effect of these
redox catalysts
              through changes in preparative procedures, electrode structure,
              and
fabrication technique. The electrodes will be tested and optimized for
              peroxide synthesis
using oxygen/air and almost pure water (pH adjusted, if
              necessary) using flow cell
experiments.  The electrodes will be tested for
              long-tem stability (500 hours).  Larger
electrodes (100cm2 ) will be
              fabricated using the best composite electrode for long-term
stability testing
              and process optimization. Commercialization of the process will be
carried out
              with a Phase III partner upon the successful completion of Phase II
              work.
Potential Commercial Application of the Research 
     Hydrogen
              peroxide is a clean oxidant, which reacts to form water as its reaction
              product.
It is therefore environmentally acceptable in many industries.  The
              market for hydrogen
peroxide is expected to grow by almost 10% for the next
              few years.  New technology
(synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from water and air)
              described in this Phase II proposal
could be implemented for various
              applications.  These areas include wastewater treatment, on-site generation
              (for industrial and consumer application such laundry bleach etc.), as well as
              commercial peroxide production.
