This Major Research Instrumentation award to Oregon State
              University's College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences provides a flow
              cytometer and cell sorter for biological research in ocean and environmental
              sciences.  It will be used for a variety of microbial ecological research
              projects by investigators from OSU and other universities. It will be managed
              as a recharge facility available to many researchers and students in the
              laboratory, and it will also be available for seagoing research projects.  The
              project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. Oregon State
              University will provide cost-share support for 30% of total project
              costs.
