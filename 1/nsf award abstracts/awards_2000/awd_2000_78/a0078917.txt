Abstract    :
              This NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering project
              addresses the development of a new process to generate highly ionized plasma
              plumes of metallic species for multi-component film growth.  Multiple,
              laser-triggered hollow-cathode plasma sources are used for the deposition of
              stoichiometric multi-component films.  The process affords precise control of
              the transient plasma dynamics and the plasma plumes can be made directional by
              external fields, thereby allowing the deposition of material on steps, facets
              or vias.  The basic mechanisms involved in the formation, propagation and gas
              phase interactions of multiple transient metallic plasmas triggered by
              synchronized laser pulses is studied through Langmuir probe and in-situ optical
              diagnostics.  These studies include the dynamics and plasma chemistry of
              multiple colliding plasmas as well as the effect of various plasma parameters
              on film stoichiometry, rate and area of growth, and the crystallinity and
              morphology of the films.  A theoretical model is developed to simulate species
              propagation in a transient plasma plume.  

Applications that include the
              deposition of Cu, TiN and CuInSe2 films are used to illustrate the general
              feasibility of the proposed manufacturing process.  This novel process will
              lead to high-throughput, high-quality, cost-effective, environmentally benign
              industrial applications in the fabrication of coatings and films.
