Abstract    :
              Biological systems are integrated complex assemblies of macromolecules that use
              chemical energy to sustain life.  As such, their properties area function of
              their physicochemical parameters such as solubility, lipophilicity, electronic
              effects, ionization, and stereochemistry, that have profound influence on the
              chemistry and biochemistry of the complex.

This project develops a
              computational platform that integrates 1. physically-based computational and
              analytical modeling using QM techniques, 2. experimental databases, 3.
              computational analysis tools, and 4. visualization/manipulation interfaces, in
              order to create a transparent and common interface for the use of these now
              relatively disparate set of tools.  This infrastructure will provide a database
              and integrate associated tools that allows the user to focus on the principles
              of stereochemistry, chemical synthesis, computational structure prediction, and
              physical analysis as applied to molecular recognition, biomolecular
              conformational analysis, and supramolecular chemistry.  The end result will
              impact biologists and biochemists working in areas such as bioorganic
              chemistry, medicinal chemistry, enzyme structure and function, and nucleic acid
              recognition.
