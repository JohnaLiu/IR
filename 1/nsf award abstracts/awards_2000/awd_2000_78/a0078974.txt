Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the photochemically induced skeletal
              reorganization of pyrones and pyridones to afford intermediates that can be
              trapped to form one or more carbon-carbon bonds and thus furnish polycyclic
              products with greatly increased molecular complexity.  The reactions of
              4-pyrones, 2-pyrones, 4-pyridones will be studied as will the application of
              2-pyrone [4+4]-photocycloaddition chemistry leading to a 5-8-5 natural product
              target. 

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              is supporting the research of Dr. Frederick G. West of the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Utah.  Professor West will focus his work on
              developing novel photochemical rearrangements and the application of the
              methodology towards organic synthesis.  The research has broader impacts for
              the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and serves as an excellent
              training ground for graduate students.
