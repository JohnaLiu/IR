Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              trace-gas detection system based on a novel laser spectroscopic technique
              called Phase Sensitive Spectroscopy.  This new spectroscopy technique may
              increase sensitivity by an order of magnitude compared to existing
              capabilities, and it is expected have lower capital and operating costs as
              well.  The proposed technique relies on measurements of phase shifts of an
              amplitude modulated laser beam that occur when the laser is tune through a
              molecular resonance.  Unlike current technologies, the measured quantity is
              insensitive to variations in the amplitude of the frequency components within
              the modulated laser beam.  This fundamental difference promises to eliminate
              the need for calibrations that are currently required.  Phase II will develop
              the fundamental understanding and lay the groundwork for commercialization. A
              prototype instrument will be fabricated by utilizing the 'backbone' of an
              existing commercially successful laser based trace-gas detector.  The detection
              limit, stability, and cost of the prototype instrument will be
              characterized.

Potential commercial applications are expected in monitoring
              gases in aluminum production and in other industries as environmental
              regulation and work place safety may require.  Point source monitoring
