Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the
              need for a new generation of laser transmitters for differential absorption
              lidar (DIAL) measurements of water vapor.  Phase II will develop a new laser
              technology for mini-DIAL measurements of water vapor.  DIAL transmitter
              requirements will be achieved using a revolutionary technology that allows
              diffraction limited performance from diode bars.  These ultra bright diode bars
              enable efficient end pumped, q-switched, low-gain, quasi-three level lasers. 
              Recently, a laser material that operates directly at the 944.1 nanometer water
              vapor absorption line has become commercially available.  Coupling these two
              technologies will result in an efficient compact DIAL transmitter.  This
              technology will result in a new class of compact, efficient, and low-cost DIAL
              transmitters for atmospheric water vapor profiling.

Low cost DIAL
              transmitters are important for future improvements in weather forecasting,
              global climate models, and understanding of the transmission of communication
              signals in the atmosphere.  In addition, potential commercial applications will
              be found in the medical and material processing industries.
