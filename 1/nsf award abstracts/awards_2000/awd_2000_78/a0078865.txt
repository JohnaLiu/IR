Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will make
              self-assembled, nanocomposite building blocks, composed of carbon nanotubes on
              a macroscopic support.  Phase I demonstrated the growth of high quality, long
              nanotubes, adhered to a metal mesh.  The support catalyzes the growth of a
              dispersed uniform structure of sootfree nanotubes.  Additional processing is
              not required.  Traditional manufacturing processes can convert the composite
              into filters, electrodes, and structures that transport mass, charge, and
              stress on nanometer scales.  The nanotubes remain organized and connected
              electrically and mechanically.  Intimate solid-gas and solid-liquid contact
              accompanied by high transport rates result.  Unlike porous nanoscale media, the
              pore size can be independent of the nanotube diameter, allowing rapid access to
              their surface.

The Phase II product will be microfiltration media with
              unprecedented filtration efficiency and low energy cost.  Carbon nanotubes have
              enhanced single-collector efficiencies and substantially high surface to volume
              ratios.  These advantages produce enormous, pound-for-pound value. The 
              industrial partner has committed Phase III funding based on initial testing and
              market pull for low-energy, cost-effective separation technology.  The
              industrial partner is committed to nanoscale technologies and the tremendous
              physical properties of the supported nanocomposites.
