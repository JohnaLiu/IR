Abstract    :
              This project employs pure electron plasmas to study two-dimensional nearly
              inviscid fluid flow.  The project unites the efforts of researchers with
              experience in pure electron plasmas and plasma fluid experiments with those
              with experience in the analytic and numerical analysis of geophysical flows and
              two-dimensional turbulence.  Key areas of study will include determining how
              complex fluid systems equilibrate and relax toward their late-time states, how
              they create structures and spatial patterns, and how the dynamics differ in
              flows that are strictly Hamiltonian from those with forcing and dissipation
              such that the phase space has both repelling and attracting regions.  The
              results of this work will have broad impact on turbulence theory, pattern
              formation, planetary atmospheres, oceanography, and star and planet formation.
