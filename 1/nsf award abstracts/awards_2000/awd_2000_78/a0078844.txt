Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop quantitative tools for the analysis
              and design of protein separations.  These tools will be useful in the
              biotechnology industry as analogous tools now used routinely to design
              conventional separations in the chemical process industries.  This development
              is based on combining theory 
and experiment to enable a new generation of
              thermodynamic models capable of describing mixtures of proteins.
