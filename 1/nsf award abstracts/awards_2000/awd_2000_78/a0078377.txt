Abstract    :
              This symposium will bring together ten scientists and engineers from the U.S.
              and Austria for the first meeting to share research on vibration signals. Talks
              will describe use of vibration in predator defense, prey detection, recruitment
              to food, mating behavior, and maternal/brood social interactions, as well as
              synthetic signals sent back to animals, and channels through which signals are
              gathered and processed.  The speakers are males and females from all academic
              ranks, engineers and biologists, field and lab specialists. The symposium will
              be hosted by the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) at its
              annual meeting, January 3-7, 2001, in Chicago. Poster and paper sessions will
              be held for students and others with interests in vibration.  A meeting hosted
              by the SICB's Division of Animal Behavior will encourage informal discussions
              among these students and the symposium speakers. The SICB provides a vehicle
              for the diversity of disciplines to come together for a highly productive
              session that will be published in a journal, American Zoologist, accessible to
              scholars that do not attend the symposium.

Computers and hardware such as
              the geophone, used to listen for footfalls in the jungles of Vietnam, now allow
              researchers to answer increasingly sophisticated questions about how animals
              send and receive signals.  Scientists have known for some time that leafcutter
              ants use vibration to recruit foragers or to signal for help when buried alive,
              but the use of vibration in animal communication is much more ubiquitous than
              previously thought. It occurs in insects, frogs, kangaroo rats, elephants and
              bison.
