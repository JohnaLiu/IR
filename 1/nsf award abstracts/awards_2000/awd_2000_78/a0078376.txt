Abstract    :
              This project will develop and implement a new analytical tool for the
              investigation of the nano-optic functional morphology of color-producing and
              transparent biological arrays. The method uses 2D and 3D discrete Fourier
              analysis of 2D and 3D electron microscope images to describe the nanostructural
              periodicity of biological arrays, to predict the hue and shape of their
              reflectance spectra, and to test the hypothesis that these structures produce
              colors or transparency by coherent scattering (i.e. interference). The project
              will further expand the method and apply it in demonstration analyses of
              nano-optic arrays from vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and viral
              aggregations that vary in spatial organization, composition, and optical
              properties. The accuracy of the physical approximations required by the model
              will be tested by comparison to explicit solutions using the finite-difference
              time-domain method. The proposed tools will unify current methods of optical
              analysis of biological nanostructures, permitting functional analysis of
              evolutionary transitions among nanostructural classes for the first time. The
              proposed tool will have broad implications for the study of the function of
              nano-optic biological arrays in communication, mate choice, sensory biology,
              crypsis, and other fields nanostructural biology.
