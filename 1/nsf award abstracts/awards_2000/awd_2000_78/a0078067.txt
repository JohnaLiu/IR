Abstract    :
              
Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are mitogenic and anabolic peptide hormones
              that play an important role in growth and differentiation of vertebrates. 
              Results of numerous studies in mammals suggest that while IGF-II is produced in
              the liver and several other pre-natal and neonatal tissues, IGF-I is produced
              in the post-natal livers under the modulation of growth hormone (GH).  The
              long-term goals of this project are to investigate the function and regulation
              of  IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF type I receptor genes on development and growth,
              using rainbow trout as model experimental animals.  In the previous funding
              cycle, this investigator has shown that: (a) a cis-acting element, C/EBP
              binding site, is present in the promoter region of the IGF II gene, and C/EBPs
              are inducible by GH, and (b) mRNA of  IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF type I are present in
              eggs as maternal mRNA, and are differentially expressed during embryonic
              development.  These results suggest that GH, IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF type I
              receptor play important roles during trout embryonic development and growth. 
              

To delineate the functions of these factors, the PI will address the
              following questions in the next three years: (1) How do the CCAAT cis-acting
              elements and their hepatic nuclear binding proteins (C/EBPs) regulate the
              expression of IGF-II by GH? (2) In addition to GH, are there any other hormonal
              factors such as prolactin, insulin, estrogen, testosterone and thyroid hormone
              that may regulate the expression of fish IGF-II gene via modulation by the
              CCAAT cis-acting elements and their hepatic nuclear binding proteins (C/EBPs)? 
              (3) Are both IGFRa and IGFRb biologically active?
