Abstract    :
              The goals of this research are: (a) The development of new, improved ligands for
              asymmetric Zr-Zn transmetalation-carbonyl addition reactions. (b) The use of
              zirconocene methodology for the total synthesis of lophotoxin. (c) The
              development of a catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition protocol for
              organozirconocenes using chiral Cu(I) complexes. (d) The study and synthetic
              applications of the water acceleration effect in the asymmetric
              carboalumination reaction of alkenes using chiral zirconocene dichlorides. (e)
              The study of epoxide opening cascades mediated by cationic zirconocenes that
              can lead to linked and fused tetrahydronfurans and pyrans of interest to
              polyether natural product synthesis.

With this award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting thre Research of Dr. Peter Wipf
              of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh.  Professor Wipf
              will focus his work on developing new zirconocene-based methodology for
              applications in organic synthesis, including the total synthesis of natural
              products.  The work has broader impacts for the pharmaceutical and agricultural
              industries.
