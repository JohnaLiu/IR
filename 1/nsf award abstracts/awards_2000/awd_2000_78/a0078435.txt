Abstract    :
              Collisionless magnetic reconnection is a well known, but poorly understood
              phenomenon that is of critical importance to space plasma physics.  This
              project seeks to understand the fundamental microphysics that produces
              collisionless reconnection by utilizing a variety of 2- and 3-dimensional
              computer codes to simulate the reconnection process.  The computer codes will
              use hybrid techniques, where the ions are treated in kinetic particle terms and
              the electrons are treated as a magnetized fluid, and particle-in-cell (PIC)
              techniques where both ions and electrons are treated in full particle dynamical
              terms.  The goal is to understand the microphysics that underlies all
              collisionless reconnection.
