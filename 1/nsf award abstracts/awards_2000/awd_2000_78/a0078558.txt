Abstract    :
              William Hase of Wayne State University is supported by a grant from the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his calculations on
              the dynamics of chemical systems.  Specific systems for investigation are: (1)
              reactions of oxygen atoms with alkyl thiolate self-assembled monolayers, (2)
              enzyme catalyzed hydroxylation of methane by methanemonooxygenase, (3) dynamics
              of gas-phase nucleophilic substitution reactions, (4) rare gas scattering by
              alkyl-thiolate self-assembled monolayers, (5) activation of peptide ions by
              collision and surface induced dissociation and (6) collision induced desorption
              of methane from platinum surfaces by argon rare gas atoms.  Both classical and
              quantum mechanical approaches will be used as appropriate and incorporated
              into, or interfaced with, his VENUS computer program.

Calculations of
              trajectories will be used to investigate the scattering and reactions of atoms
              with free molecules and self-assembled surfaces and desorption from those
              surfaces.  The studies will be extended to include activation of peptides and
              reactions catalyzed by enzymes which have biological implications.  The
              computer programs developed for these studies will be made available to the
              scientific community so that a wide range of systems can be studied.
