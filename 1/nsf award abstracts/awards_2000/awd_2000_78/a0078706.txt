Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is for development of
              fast bootstrap confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, and ways to make
              bootstrapping feasible for large data sets.  Classical inference (intervals and
              tests) methods are known to be inaccurate when theoretical assumptions are
              violated, the usual case in practice. For example, skewness causes the usual
              t-test to be in error.  The new methods are an order of magnitude (power of
              sqrt(n), where n is the sample size) more accurate in general than classical
              inferences.  Bootstrap methods are a promising alternative to classical
              inferences, and can handle complex statistics including modern robust
              statistics, but are slow and have been little used in practice.

The methods
              proposed are typically 17--37 times faster than other bootstrap methods.  The
              methods are fast enough to be seamlessly incorporated into standard software,
              alongside or instead of classical inferences.  This provides statistical
              practitioners a realistic alternative to easy but inaccurate classical
              inferences and non-robust methods.  The competitive advantage to the firm that
              does this first is a major opportunity.  Furthermore, the large sample methods
              would be attractive in the thriving data mining market.
