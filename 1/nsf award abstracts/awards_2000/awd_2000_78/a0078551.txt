Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on
              improving solution growth of Nd and Yb,Pr-doped NaYF4 single crystals.  Two
              alternate techniques are proposed: top seeded solution growth and traveling
              solvent zone.  Phase I results indicate that spectroscopically Nd:NYF is
              superior to YAG and YLF and as good or better than YVO4 as a laser diode-pumped
              laser; and that Yb,Pr:NaYF4 is a 1.3 micron emitter with favorable properties
              for use in telecommunications.  In a parallel effort to crystal growth, laser
              evaluation of NYF will continue through laser tests and by measurements of
              NYF's thermo-optic properties.  In Phase I a very efficient single phase green
              emitter Yb,Er :NYF phosphor was demonstrated. A second thrust of this Phase II
              effort will then be to develop synthesis processes of granular doped NYF
              materials for their use in 2-D and 3-D displays. Combinations of Yb,RE-doped
              NYF will be prepared to extend the range of colors to red and blue.

Nd:NYF
              is seen as a superior material to YLF and YAG for compact diode pumped lasers
              and an economical alternative to Nd:YVO4 currently used. Yb, Pr: NYF can be
              used as amplifiers for telecommunications in the important 1.3 micron
              wavelength range. NYF phosphors, dispersed in plastic hosts can be used in 2
              and 3-D transparent displays for head mounted applications such as air traffic
              control, medicine, autos and aircraft.
