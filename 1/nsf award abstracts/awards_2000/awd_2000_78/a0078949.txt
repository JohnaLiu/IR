Abstract    :
              This award allows Roman Sobolewski to collaborate with Michael Siegel of the
              National Research Center (Forschungszentrum) in Juelich, Germany.  The project
              will investigate the intrinsic dynamical properties of high-temperature
              superconducting Josephson junctions by experimental determination of the
              coupling mechanism for the junction when switched either by picosecond
              electrical pulses or perturbed by femtosecond-pulse optical excitations. 
              

The ultimate goal of the research is to develop and fabricate
              high-temperature superconducting devices and circuits for ultrafast computing
              and optoelectronic links for supercomputing electronics.  The research will
              also test the ultimate limit of the operating speed of a single-flux quantum
              superconducting Josephson gate.
