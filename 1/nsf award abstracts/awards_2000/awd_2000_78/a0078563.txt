Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will contribute
              mathematical services in signal and image processing for distributed Java
              computing.  A major component of internetworked information is digital images
              and audio signals. Current vector, signal, and image processing standards are
              evaluated to achieve advanced signal processing for Java. Phase I emphasized
              the design, algorithms, and Java relevance.  VSIP (vector signal and image
              processing) constitutes a viable option for commercialization in the
              distributed Java environment. This Phase II effort seeks to bridge the gap
              between the theoretical and the commercial for VSIP in Java, while identifying
              operational modes and service requirements for this non-traditional programming
              environment. If successful, a huge community of Java programmers in academia,
              industry, and government could be enabled, as well as all the service
              recipients whose applications exploit such as library.

Standardization for
              platform independence is a critical issue for Internet applications.  An
              advanced commercially DSP toolkit would provide for a greater level of
              portability for signal-processing-intensive Internet applications. This would
              provide for better support for processing audio/visual information in valuable
              application settings. Embedded Java applications will make use of the toolkit
              to provide advanced signal analysis capabilities with mobility, portability,
              and high quality.
