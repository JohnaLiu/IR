Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research on the stoichiometric and catalytic transformations involving
              f-element and related organometallic molecules by Professor Tobin Marks of the
              Chemistry Department at Northwestern University.  Using primarily heavier group
              14-16 metallocene complexes synthesized by the P.I. and collaborators, reaction
              calorimetry is utilized to quantify the strengths of metal-ligand multiple
              bonds. The scope and mechanisms of organolanthanide/actinide catalyzed
              reactions will be determined, to include hydroamination, phosphination and
              boration as well as olefin polymerization to produce polymers end-capped with a
              hetroatom (Si, Sn, B, Al) group.

The goal of this research is to discover,
              understand, improve and apply chemical transformations involving organometallic
              molecules and molecular fragments to numerous areas of US industrial chemistry.
              The work focuses on the use of organometallic complexes of lanthanides and
              actinides, a relatively unexplored area, to effect these transformations which
              include catalytic processes for the production of fuels, polymeric materials,
              pharmecuticals and other economically important chemicals. This project will
              help to build both a broad knowledge base and a technically skilled cadre of
              researchers trained to develop more efficient, selective, environmentally
              benign and economically competitive process technologies.
