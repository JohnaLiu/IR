Distinct organs in the body of human are formed by similar signals
              through
cell-cell communications.  This proposal focuses on the genetic
              details
that tell cells to form the ear and where to form.  The mammalian
              ear
formation involves a series of different signals from different
              adjacent
tissues.  However, despite much speculation as to the signals
              from
neighboring tissues, the identity of the signals and how the
              cells
communicate with each other are not known.  A gene called Eyes absent 1
              has
been knocked out in mice.  Mutations in the same gene in fruit flies
              cause
no eye formation.  Interestingly, Eya1 mutant mice develop no ears and
              the
cells normally forming the ear die from very early embryonic
              stages,
indicating that Eya1 is a key early gene required for ear
              development.
This proposal will use Eya1- and other Eya-deficient mice to
              study how the
mammalian ears form in appropriate places in the body by
              molecular and
genetic approaches.
	This project begins to dissect out the
              molecular and genetic
information required for normal formation of the
              mammalian ear.  Thus, the
major significance of the proposed studies is that
              they represent one of
the first attempts to define specific gene function in
              the context of the
normal developmental mechanisms operating in ear formation.
