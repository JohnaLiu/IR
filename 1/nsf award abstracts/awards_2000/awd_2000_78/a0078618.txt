Abstract    :
              This is an investigation of fundamental plasma physics and chemistry in
              microhollow cathode discharges (MHCDs) with the objectives of determining (1)
              characteristic lengths of plasma boundary layers in microhollow cathode
              discharges to provide information on coupling mechanisms between opposite
              cathode falls; (2) plasma parameters that determine the rate of generation of
              excimers, such as electron density, electron energy, gas temperature, discharge
              current and discharge voltage; and (3) the optical gain of high-pressure MCHDs
              with the goal of explain their possible use as a micro excimer laser medium. 
              The experimental studies are supported by computer modeling.  The relations of
              global discharge parameters to fundamental plasma properties and the scaling of
              excimer laser gain in  xenon-chloride MHCDs are investigated
              computationally.

Microhollow cathode discharge (MHCDs) are nonthermal
              high-pressure gas discharges between a hollowcathode and a planar or hollow
              anode with electrode dimensions in the range of 100 micrometers. The large
              concentration of high-energy electrons and the high neutral-gas density favor
              three-body processes such as excimer formation.  This along with the
              simplicicty of design and operation, make these systems attractive candidates
              for light sources, sources of charged particles, and micro plasma reactors.
