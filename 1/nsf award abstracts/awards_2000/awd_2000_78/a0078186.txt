Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
              Irvine will acquire a Circular Dichroism Spectrometer. This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including a) studies on novel polymers,
              co-polymers, block polymers and ionomers; b) engineering of natural products
              via tryptophan dimerization; c) characterization of novel protein systems; d)
              development of efficient chemical syntheses of complex molecules of biomedical
              importance; e) structure determination of acetonide compounds; and f) chemical
              models of protein beta-sheet interactions.  

Circular dichroism spectroscopy
              is an extremely useful tool in modern analytical chemistry.  It provides a very
              reliable and sensitive method for assigning absolute molecular configurations. 
              The results from these studies will have an impact in a number of areas
              including materials chemistry and biochemistry.
