Abstract    :
              The main thrust of this project is an in-depth experimental and theoretical
              study of the use of optical pumping, as an alternative to direct electron
              impact ionization, for the production of low translational temperature (of the
              order of 500 K), highly non-equilibrium, high-pressure plasmas.   The approach
              is based on the combination of resonant absorption of continuous wave infrared
              radiation from a CO laser with anharmonic collisional vibration-vibration
              energy transfer.   The work will investigate the following questions: 1) What
              is the principal mechanism and the rate of free electron loss in these systems?
               2) Can the electron density be increased efficiently while maintaining
              unconditional stability? and 3) How quantitatively can the coupling between
              free electrons and the vibrational mode be predicted?
