Abstract    :
              This research program entitled "Structures of Gas-Phase Protein Ions" represents
              a significant expansion of the prior work of Dr. David Clemmer of Indiana
              University at Bloomington and is supported by the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry program.  The goal of this research is to investigate the
              3-dimensional conformation of gas-phase proteins and peptides using a modified
              ion mobility/time of flight mass spectrometer.  The instrumentation to be used
              can accommodate a high number of analyses, which will enable the screening of
              large libraries of compounds.  Chemical probes, such as hydrogen-deuterium
              (H/D) exchange reactions, will be used to investigate both conformation and
              reactivity.   The novel experiments planned, which couple H/D exchange studies
              with collision induced dissociation experiments, may result in an important new
              technique for interpreting and measuring H/D exchange data.  The correlation
              between solution phase and gas phase protein conformations is not well defined,
              and may not be similar to solution phase conformations.  However, if a
              correlation is found, this research could have a major impact on the
              understanding of the chemical mechanisms of biological reactivity and the study
              of protein structure/reactivity relationships.  

With the increased
              understanding of the role of proteins in biological systems, it is now known
              that the 3-dimensional structure of a protein directly effects the function to
              be performed by the protein. Thus, an important area of chemical research today
              is the development of techniques to establish the 3-dimensional structure.  In
              this fundamental research by Professor Clemmer, he will develop a new technique
              to examine protein structure.  This research, though high risk, has the
              potential to impact society in the future through improved understanding of 
              disease mechanisms based on protein structure/function relationships.  This
              will lead to enhancements in pharmaceutical development and treatment of
              disease.
