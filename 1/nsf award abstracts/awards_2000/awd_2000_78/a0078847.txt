Abstract    :
              
In research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
              Professor Mary Wirth and her coworkers at the University of Delaware are
              applying methods of single molecule spectroscopy to the investigation of the
              phenomenon of strong adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces.  Strong binding of
              molecules to specific minority sites on silica and modified silica surfaces
              leads to poor separation in chromatographic methods.  A molecular level
              understanding of this strong adsorption process and diffusion of adsorbed
              molecular species on the silica surface is the goal of this research project. 
              Information gained from these studies will be useful in designing better
              separations media, as well as in addressing questions of protein surface
              interactions and biocompatibility in materials applications.  

Using single
              molecule spectroscopic probes, Professor Wirth and her coworkers at the
              University of Delaware are examining the strong interaction of molecular
              adsorbates with modified silica surfaces.  These spectroscopic probes provide
              structural information about the adsorption site, and can help to explain
              tailing in separations processes.  Information from these studies can also be
              used to design improved chromatographic materials, and can help to develop an
              understanding of the interactions of protein and tissue materials with implant
              and medical device surfaces.
