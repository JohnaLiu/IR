Abstract    :
              Jason Halfen of the University of Wisconsin--Eau Claire is supported by the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for Research in an
              Undergraduate Institution dealing with development of novel catalysts
              (involving coordination compounds of copper) for the aziridination of olefins.
              Main aims of the research include:examination of effects of ligand structure on
              the ability of catalysts to transfer nitrene groups to olefins; spectroscopic
              and structural characterization of a high-valent copper-nitrene complex (a
              putative intermediate in the reaction of interest); exploration of novel
              protecting groups; detailed mechanistic analysis of the
              reaction.

Aziridines, the end products of the reactions being studied in
              this project, are strained, nitrogen-containing heterocycles that are finding
              increasingly wide use in organic synthesis. Aziridines are also present in
              several naturally occurring drugs that are potent anticancer agents. This
              research will facilitate synthetic use of aziridines and also contribute to
              increased understanding of their function in complex systems, including
              biological activity and medicinal uses.
