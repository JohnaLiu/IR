Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable
              conversion of low value residual edgings from sawmill operations into a
              structural quality engineered wood composite called Structural Strand Lumber
              (SSL).  Edgings are created at sawmills when round logs are sawn into
              rectangular pieces of lumber.  The SSL concept is to cut these edgings into
              strands, align them directionally, and then glue and compress them into a high
              value product.  Edging material currently is used for low value wood chips for
              use in paper production.  The SSL process will enable sawmills to convert up to
              14% more of forest raw materials into structural quality lumber compared to
              conventional practices.  SSL manufacturing will yield a high value added wood
              product, dramatically reduce waste, reduce demand on natural resources, and
              increase sawmill operating efficiency.  These benefits will reduce dramatically
              the environmental impacts of sawmill operations.  Phase I research provided a
              fundamental understanding of key processes, and clearly demonstrated the
              feasibility of the SSL concept.  Phase II will demonstrate the operation of
              critical SSL components, and enable a manufacturing facility prototype
              demonstration early in the Commercialization Phase.

If the research is
              successful, dramatic increases in the fraction of a log that can be used for
              quality structural materials will result.  The cost of the engineered material
              will be competitive with solid high-grade structural material.  The method is
              applicable to virtually all sawmills operating in the United States and around
              the world.  More efficient utilization of existing wood supply will be enabled
              by this innovation.
