Abstract    :
              This award by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry
              Division and Solid State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials
              Research jointly supports Professor Lee Park of Williams College, an
              undergraduate liberal arts college, and is to study the use of liquid
              crystalline materials as molecular conductors. The preparation of
              one-dimensional liquid crystalline materials of metallomesogens with order and
              anisotrophy, and with a variety of physical properties are being studied under
              this award. Liquid crystalline derivatives of known one-directional structures
              of rigid aromatic core fragments with polar substituents are also being
              synthesized. Teaching and training of undergraduate students in materials
              science are parts of the award. 

Under the award, metallomesogens with rigid
              aromatic core fragments and polar substituents are synthesized. These
              structures are robust and oriented in one direction, and their structural
              integrity and shape are reinforced by intermolecular hydrogen bonding.  The
              broader impact of the project is the potential applications of these materials
              with enhanced material properties in high performance electrical and magnetic
              devices, and they are likely to be fabricated at a lower processing cost.  In
              addition, the research program will provide a rich multidisciplinary education
              and training opportunity in materials chemistry to undergraduate students.
