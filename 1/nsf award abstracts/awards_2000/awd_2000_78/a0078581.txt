Abstract    :
              This project will capitalize on improvements in laser technology that make it
              possible to generate extremely high laser intensities to probe in detail the
              highly relativistic parameter regime of laser-plasma interactions.  Previous
              results on harmonic generation from relativistic Thomson scattering will be
              extended into the XUV spectral region, and the dependence of the harmonic
              generation on laser and plasma parameters will be explored.  Previously
              observed ion acceleration will be studied in more detail to understand the
              origin of the ions and the behavior of the acceleration as a function of laser
              parameters.  This work has technological applications to the generation of
              short x-ray radiation, the ignition of laser-fusion targets, and compact and
              inexpensive medical radiation sources.
