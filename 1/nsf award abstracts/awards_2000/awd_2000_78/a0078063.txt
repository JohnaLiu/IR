Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Brown University will acquire an
              Electrospray LC-Quadrupole Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including a) the biosynthesis of
              polyketide and other natural products; b) screening of the activity of a
              combinatorial library of peptide-based protease inhibitors; c) analysis of
              complex glycolipids involved in molecular recognition events on cell surfaces;
              d) investigations of enolate structures; e) analysis of recombinantly expressed
              proteins used to study biochemical recognition processes; and f) investigations
              of the structure of adducts that play a role in carcinogenicity.  

Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
              to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
              and organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including medicinal chemistry and biology.
