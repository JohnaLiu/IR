CADRE: A Tool for
              Transforming WordNet into a Core Knowledge Base

  This project extends a
              popular database of English words to make it more useful in such tasks as
              question answering, information retrieval, and summarization.  Wordnet is a
              lexical database for English that has been widely adopted in artificial
              intelligence and computational linguistics for a variety of practical
              applications.  The basic elements of WordNet are sets of words that are linked
              according to semantic relations:  synonomy, antonymy, superordination, and so
              forth.  WordNet is publicly available, widely used, and is currently being into
              a multilingual database.

This project will develop a set of tools that can
              be applied to current and future versions of WordNet to extend it for knowledge
              processing applications.  The extensions are enhancements of the glosses that
              currently contain definitions, comments, and examples of sets of words that are
              linked in WordNet.  Enhanced glosses will be syntactically parsed, will have
              each word tagged with its part of speech, and will themselves be linked with
              other glosses that describe related concepts.
