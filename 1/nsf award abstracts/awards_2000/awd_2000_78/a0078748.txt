Hefzy, 
This five year continuing award will fund Undergraduate Design
              Projects to develop custom assistive devices for persons with disabilities. A
              group of students and the investigators on the project will work on these
              projects with health care personnel and patients at the Physical Medicine and
              Rehabilitation Unit of the Medical College of Ohio. At the end of each semester
              an exposition is to be organized to display the prototypes built by the
              students along with final oral presentations of their work. Ten projects per
              year are to be completed and written reports on the projects will be submitted
              for an annual publication.

This type of undertaking is important as it
              provides meaningful projects for engineering students to complete as part of
              their undergraduate design requirements and also benefits a population where
              customization is often needed for rehabilitation devices.
