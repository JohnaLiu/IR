Abstract    :
              The tasks accomplished by this project are divided into two phases corresponding
              to the two tasks of gene prediction and functional annotation.  In the first
              phase, a gene-finding system is developed and applied.  This system is designed
              to be scalable and extensible with respect to the gene features it models, the
              machine learning algorithms it employs, and the range of experimental data from
              which it learns.  This project first validates the system by applying it to the
              complete C.elegans genome, and then retrains the system for the more difficult
              task of recognizing genes in human DNA.  The second phase of this project
              consists of two parts.  First, the software framework used for the gene finding
              system from phase one is generalized to model families of related proteins. 
              Second, in order to learn from non-sequential data, the project develops
              functional classification techniques using a discriminative learning method
              called support vector machines (SVM's).  The statistics calculated by the
              sequence-based modeling system functions as one set of features used by the SVM
              system.  Additional features will come from DNA microarray experiments, the
              upstream promoter region of each gene, phylogenetic profiles and similarity
              scores to known protein families.
