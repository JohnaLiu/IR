Abstract    :
              In this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, Professors James Evans and Patricia Thiel and their coworkers at Iowa
              State University are examining the atomic level mechanisms of thin film growth.
               Using a combined experimental/computational approach, this team is
              investigating the anisotropic homoepitaxial growth of metals on metals,
              concentrating on the growth of silver on the Ag(110) single crystal surface. 
              The effect of adsorbate surfactants on the growth mechanism and morphology of
              the thin film is also examined.  Variable temperature scanning tunneling
              microscopy, high-resolution low energy electron diffraction, and kinetic Monte
              Carlo methods are all used to examine these growth processes.  The results of
              this work help to define and control the structure and stability of
              nanostructures for various technological applications.

Understanding the
              detailed mechanism of metal on metal growth is the goal of this research
              project carried out at Iowa State University.  A combination of experimental
              and computational methods is used to examine anisotropic growth, surfactant
              mediated growth, and the stability and morphology of nanostructures on metal
              and graphite surfaces.  Information obtained from these studies impacts
              technologies for electronic device fabrication and nanostructured materials.
