Abstract    :
              This award to the University of Oregon by the NSF Chemistry Division's Special
              Projects Office, its Chemical and Transport Systems Division and the National
              institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH supports activities by the
              Committee on the Advancement of Women Chemists to increase the number and
              effectiveness of women in leadership positions in the chemical sciences. The
              project will conduct research to identify factors that are contributing to
              women's lack of progress in academia, develop a network among women in the
              chemical sciences workforce to share strategies for successful careers and
              implement a series of workshops to assist women faculty in achieving their
              career goals and assuming leadership positions in the profession.  This project
              will redress gender disparity in the academic chemical sciences workforce.
