This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
              project will develop thin-film nitrogen oxide sensors based on novel
              binary-phased nanocomposites by sol-gel processing.  Sol-gel processing offers
              many advantages for sensor fabrication, including facility and versatility for
              nano-engineering of the microstructure.  In Phase I, such sensor elements have
              shown much improved microstructure, enhanced sensitivity, and faster response
              speed than powder-derived sensor elements of the same composition by
              conventional processing.  Thin-film sensors can be readily incorporated with
              silicon microelectronic technology and conveniently allow miniaturization, low
              process costs, and high reproducibility.  Phase II will systematically optimize
              the processing, microstructure, and performance of the binary-phased thin-film
              nitrogen oxides sensors by sol-gel processing.

Potential commercial
              applications of the research are expected in reliable, compact solid-state
              chemical sensors.  This innovation is expected to provide highly stable and
              sensitive thin-film nitrogen oxides sensors for automotive emission control,
              industrial processing control, and environmental monitoring.  These sensors may
              be used as stand-alone sensing devices or as sensing units to be integrated
              into on-chip multifunctional sensors and smart structures.
