Abstract    :
              Lester Andrews of the University of Virginia is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his spectroscopic studies
              of laser ablation to obtain absorption spectra and vibrational frequencies of a
              series of transition metal complexes (positively and negatively charged and
              neutral) clustered with molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide.  This is
              achieved using laser ablation of Ne matrices containing the appropriate
              species, with the spectra being obtained by Fourier transform infrared
              spectroscopy.  Spectroscopic identification will be achieved by isotopic
              substitution and theoretical calculations using density functional theory and
              comparisons will be made with the theoretical predictions.  The work will
              establish, for example, whether the hydrogen is bound in molecular form or if
              it forms a di-hydride with the metal atom.  Such species are involved in many
              important reactions in organometallic chemistry.

It has been suggested that
              it may be possible to grow carbon nanotubes  using metal carbonyl clusters. 
              Such clusters, and clusters with hydrogen, are involved in many organometallic
              ion reactions such as synthesis of ammonia.  The properties of these clusters
              will be determined spectroscopically and compared with theoretical
              calculations.
