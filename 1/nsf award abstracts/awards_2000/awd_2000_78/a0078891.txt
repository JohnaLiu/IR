              Abstract 0078891

This project will investigate the issue of water use and
              availability in Leukerbad, Switzerland, focusing on how these processes are
              shaped by the population' assessments and perceptions of water as a resource
              (marketable commodity, subsistence resource, hydroelectric energy source,
              health resource, aspect of the environment). As spa town with
              hydrotherapy-based clinics and hydroelectric plants, Leukerbad's population is
              economically dependent on high quality water resources in many forms. This
              research will examine the historic and current uses of water resources, the
              management of water resources as commodity and commons, the relationship
              between perceived water qualities (and attached meanings) and chemical analyses
              of water, and the potential impact of anticipated climatic changes on water
              systems. Methods include mapping of water resources, archival research,
              structured interviews and surveys of the population, as well as chemical
              analyses of water samples. This project will contribute to our understanding of
              how sociocultural forces shape use and management of a critical natural
              resource; it will also contribute to our understanding of how communities may
              respond to anticipated future climatic changes affecting water quality and
              availability.
