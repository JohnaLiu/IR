Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division is supporting the research of Professors Harry B. Gray and
              Jay R. Winkler, California Institute of Technology. This project aims to probe
              long-range electron transfer and the role of electron tunneling through
              materials such as proteins. Electron transfer of this type is extremely
              sensitive to the difference in energy between the bridge and those of the donor
              and acceptor.  Tunneling-energy effects should be readily observable for
              electron transfer over distances greater than twenty Angstroms in systems where
              the potentials of the redox sites differ only marginally from those of the
              bridge sites. Oligoxylyene-bridged binuclear have been designed specifically to
              meet these criteria. Distance decay parameters will be extracted from
              correlations of electron transfer rates to the number of xylene units in the
              bridge.

Electron-transfer reactions are the simplest of chemical
              transformations in that no bonds are formed or broken as the electron migrates
              from the donor to the acceptor. When the redox partners are separated by long
              distances, the rate of electron transfer is mediated by the intervening medium.
               This research will study the effects of energy differences between electronic
              states in the bridge and those of the donor and acceptor metal ions.
