Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to
              establishing the first-ever, large-scale production capability needed to
              manufacture carbon nanotube tips for scanning probe tools.  To achieve this,
              the investigator must combine several fabrications technologies in a unique
              way.  The investigator must also solve challenging problems related to the
              design, structural form and attachment of the tips themselves that will enable
              them, as the manufacturer, to guarantee that the products sold meets customers'
              performance specifications.  It is  believed, for example, that one of their
              proprietary technologies will enable them to produce carbon nanotube tips that
              meet the important requirement for adequate stiffness in lateral bending.  The
              core technology being commercialized stems from a new approach for growing a
              single, aligned carbon nanotube directly on a cantilever, originally identified
              by the PI.  This approach is suitable for fabricating both the carbon nanotube
              tip and the cantilever in one continuous process, ideal for large-scale
              manufacturing.

Xidex will develop, manufacture and sell carbon nanotube tips
              for use with critical dimension atomic force microscopes (CD-AFMs), scanning
              capacitance microscopes (SCMs), regular atomic force microscopes (AFMs) and
              scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs)
