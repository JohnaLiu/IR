Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project was motivated by recent
              research demonstrating that ferroelectric cathodes using commercial
              ferroelectric materials that were optimized for transducer applications can
              produce current densities in excess of 30 Amperes per square centimeter at
              500,000 Volts, and can sustain an emission pulse (at 50,000 Volts) for a time
              in excess of 2 microseconds. Under the Phase I project ferroelectric materials
              optimized for use as cathodes were fabricated and tested, and promising
              materials were identified for further testing and optimization. The objective
              of the Phase II project will be to demonstrate a ferroelectric material with
              emission characteristics and lifetime meeting industry-defined requirements for
              application as a cathode in a commercial electron tube. Phase II research
              will
include cathode testing at 20,000 volts, 1 microsecond with hundreds of
              pulses per second, characterization of the electron beam produced by the
              ferroelectric cathode according to size, energy and emittance, and validation
              testing of the cathode at an electron tube manufacturer's facility under
              commercial operating conditions. It is anticipated that these tests will
              demonstrate the efficacy of the ferroelectric cathode materials developed under
              this project for use in commercial electron tubes.

Cathodes are used in a
              wide variety of microwave tubes. Applications include radar, communications,
              radio and TV transmission, accelerators for medical, waste treatment,
              environmental and research applications.
