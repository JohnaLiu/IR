Abstract    :
              Equipment is acquired to support research on kinetics of elementary reactions,
              the mechanism of dioxin formation from combustion, and the use of solar energy
              to destroy hazardous wastes.  The equipment consists of a high-temperature flow
              reactor that is equipped for optical pumping and is interfaced with a
              time-of-flight mass spectrometer, excimer laser that axially pumps the flow
              reactor to generate reactive radicals photochemically, and a time-of-flight
              mass spectrometer (TOFMS) for analysis of products.
