Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from RSK Assessments,
              Inc. will expand and improve upon the test battery implemented for Phase I,
              including cross validation, examination of other behavioral scoring approaches
              (signal detection theory, Bayesian methods), other agents (viz., sleep loss) as
              well as the interplay of these methods on special purpose hardware and new
              software.  Phase I examined the feasibility of conducting human
              performance-based fitness-for-duty (FFD) testing as an alternative to
              chemically-based testing.  The testing method was brief and inexpensive, and
              the tests were stable and reliable.  Using a multiple cut-off analysis varying
              proportion of tests passed, they yielded 98+% specificity (minimal false
              positives) with 80% sensitivity for high dosages of alcohol (and 60% for low). 
              The new battery tightens security, running within self-contained kiosks and
              providing data encryption and access via smart card usage.  Improved managerial
              control will be implemented within the test system, including test control and
              scheduling, data analysis methods, and reporting.  Additional means of
              quantifying behavioral decrements will be obtained from sleep deprivation
              research, analyses of past alcohol research, and an "alpha" test site.  Data
              from these sources will yield a better assessment model and refine calculations
              for tradeoff between test length, specificity, and sensitivity.

RSK
              Assessments proffers a tool for testing human performance that could facilitate
              higher productivity in industrial plants, a means of testing employees while in
              the field, and reduction in worker on-the-job injuries.
