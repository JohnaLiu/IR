Abstract    :
              This research investigates evolution in high elevation populations of the leaf
              beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis.  Populations in the Sierra Nevada (California)
              are on the southern edge of the species' range.  Previous studies found that
              drainages differ in air temperature and beetle populations fluctuate with
              changes in climate.  Frequencies of different forms (genotypes) of the
              temperature-sensitive enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) vary among
              drainages, suggesting that natural selection acts on PGI.  Heat shock protein
              (Hsp) levels in beetles correspond to air temperature differences and depend on
              PGI genotype.  

The proposed research will investigate the relationship
              between temperature and functional property of PGI genotypes (i.e. their
              ability to catalyze biochemical reactions fundamental to metabolism).  Second,
              the effects of temperature on the physiology of beetles of different PGI
              genotype will be studied, using Hsp's and ubiquitin conjugates as indices of
              physiological stress.  Third, survival and reproduction of beetles of different
              PGI genotype in nature will be compared.  The research will provide important
              information about the evolutionary significance of enzyme polymorphisms.  It
              may add insight about the impact of climate change on native insects.  Finally,
              it will allow undergraduates to participate in basic research, enhance their
              educational experience and expand their opportunities for the future
