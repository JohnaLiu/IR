MRI:  Parallel Computer
              Equipment for the Levich Institute of CCNY

The faculty of the Levich
              Institute of the City College of New York requests funding for the purchase of
              a medium-scale parallel computer system for research in fluid mechanics.  The
              equipment will support research activities in (1) shear-induced diffusion in
              suspensions, (2) polymer blends and instabilities, (3) complex multiphase
              flows, (4) molecular fluid mechanics and (5) interfacial and surfactant
              dynamics.  In addition, the proposed system will be invaluable for broad
              educational purposes: developing the conceptual familiarity, hands-on
              experience, and hardware infrastructure required thinking and working
              computationally in parallel terms
