Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. Kevin P. Gable of the Department of Chemistry at
              Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.   The research will extend
              investigations of diolate cycloreversion to study the mechanism of a new
              epoxide deoxygenation, to determine whether the epoxide undergoes synchronous
              or asynchronous bond cleavage.   A new exploration of useful applications of
              rhenium-mediated O-atom transfer will be initiated.

Selective transfer of
              oxygen into organic molecules is a large and important class of organic
              reactions.   One approach is to cleave O2 to form reactive M=O units from a
              low-valent transition metal complex.   Reaction of olefins could then give
              epoxide or diolate complexes in which one or two new C-O bonds are formed,
              respectively.  Much of the work done here, involving the cycloreversion of
              oxorhenium(V) diolate complexes, involves the microscopic reverse.   Oxygen
              atom transfer to phosphorus(III) is more thermodynamically favorable than
              transfer to carbon.   Tailoring the steric properties of the ligand in LReO3
              should make it possible to separate racemic mixtures of chiral phosphines by
              selective oxidation of one of the enantiomers.   An attractive feature of
              investment in the project is that the PI includes a large number of
              undergraduates in his research.
