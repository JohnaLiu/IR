Abstract    :
              Timothy Steimle of Arizona State University is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program with which he is using optical
              absorption spectroscopy to study early transition metal containing radicals and
              magnesium organometallic radicals.  The radicals will be generated in the
              supersonic expansion of a laser ablated metal source and the species detected
              using high resolution LIF and a proposed transient frequency modulation
              spectrometer.  These techniques will be  used to obtain hyperfine structure of
              these species and permanent electric dipole moments.  Dipole moments will be
              obtained for the TiCH and VCH known radicals.  MgOH, MgCH3, MgCCH, TiCH and
              CuOH will be studied and searches will be made for hydroxide, imide and thiol
              radicals containing early transition metals.  These data are a stringent test
              of theory involving electron correlation.

This detailed spectroscopy study
              of transition metal containing compounds will provide  high resolution spectra
              from which fundamental information on permanent electric dipoles of the
              compounds will be obtained.  This will be used to test state of the art
              theories which are in the development phase for these difficult species.  The
              data are also widely applicable to organometallic, analytical and high
              temperature chemistry and to stellar atmospheres and the interstellar medium.
