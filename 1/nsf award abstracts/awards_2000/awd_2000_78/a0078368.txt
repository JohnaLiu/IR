Linkages between microbial diversity and
              processes along nutrient gradients in wetlands

Much is known of the response
              of process-level functions (e.g. rates of carbon mineralization, nitrogen
              fixation, denitrification, sulfate reduction) to nutrient inputs in wetlands. 
              Almost nothing is known of the prokaryotes responsible for these processes or
              of possible changes in species composition or richness of the resident
              microbial communities. This Florida Everglades study will test the hypothesis
              that the addition of nutrients to a large-scale ecosystem will change
              activities and representation of key groups of bacteria responsible for carbon
              and nitrogen cycling and sulfate reduction. The investigators are using
              molecular methods to study the microbial groups present along a phosphorus
              gradient, identifying "indicator" phylogenetic and functional groups that
              change either with regard to composition, species richness or activity along
              the gradient. The study will provide an opportunity to study the process of
              "reverse eutrophication" (recovery) using an integrated biogeochemical
              cellular, and microbial process-level approach.
