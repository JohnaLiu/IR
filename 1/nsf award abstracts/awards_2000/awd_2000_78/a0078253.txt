Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State University
              will upgrade a 300 MHz NMR and acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This
              equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) synthesis of
              natural products and biologically active compounds using chiral auxiliary
              mediated asymmetric synthesis; b) the design and use of stereoregular polymers
              in direct lithography schemes; c) synthesis of multiporphyrin light-harvesting
              arrays and related molecular photonic devices; d) polymers with well-defined
              architectures; e) paramagnetic ligands for novel extended solids and porphyrins
              as building blocks for molecule-based magnets; and f) coumarin based cyclic
              prodrugs of peptides and peptidomimetics.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry.
