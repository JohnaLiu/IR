Abstract    :
              Since 1776, American states have continually amended and revised their
              constitutions. States have experimented with a wide variety of suffrage,
              representation, legislative structures, judicial structures, corporate law, and
              public finance. The constitutions themselves are a record of fundamental
              institutional change in American history. It is a record that not only reflects
              changes in the way Americans think about their governments, but a record of the
              changing institutional constraints on the American economy.
Since 1997 we have
              been assembling the texts of the state constitutions and their amendments. Most
              of the texts are now available on our web site:
              www.bsos.umd.edu/wallis/constitution.asp. The constitutions will ultimately be
              indexed by article and section. The index will include thirty main divisions
              and roughly a thousand topics. The database containing the constitutions can be
              searched by date, state, and topic. Text can be downloaded in the form of
              constitutions, articles, and sections.
The proposed research will allow us to
              complete the coding and indexing of the constitutions; complete the collection
              and integration of constitutional amendments into the data base; and construct
              a series of data sets measuring attributes of constitutions. These data sets
              cover a range of topics. They will be in the form of spreadsheets with detailed
              breakdowns by state and year for each entry. The data sets will also be
              available through the web site.
