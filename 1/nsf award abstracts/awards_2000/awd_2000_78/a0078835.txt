Abstract    :
              With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              continues its support for the work of Drs. Devens J. Gust, Anna L. Moore, and
              Thomas A. Moore of the Department of Chemistry at Arizona State University in
              Tempe, Arizona.   Initial studies will involve carotenoid/porphyrin/fullerene
              (C-P-C60) triads, with photoexcitation leading to long lived C.+-P-C60.- charge
              separated states.   These will lead to large synthetic porphyrin arrays linked
              to fullerene electron acceptors.   Linking spiropyrans is expected to lead to
              light-activated switches.   Finally, a cell-like vesicle-based system for
              conversion of light energy to chemical potential will be developed.

The work
              is aimed at the synthesis and investigation of the next generation of molecular
              photochemical energy conversion apparatus, mimicing the elements of natural
              photosynthesis:  electronic excitation, charge separation, a transmembrane
              proton gradient, and energy storage in chemical products.   In addition to the
              fundamental understanding developed, there is a real potential for the
              development of practical photoelectronic devices, including switches activated
              by light, and cells which convert solar energy into stored chemical energy more
              efficiently than green plants.   The project requires a combination of many
              skills and techniques (organic chemistry, spectroscopy, biochemistry, and
              quantum chemistry) and should provide excellent training for the students
              involved.
