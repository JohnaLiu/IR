Our research addresses how people and organizations learn
              from experience
in strategic situations like bargaining, coordinating joint
              actions
(teamwork), choosing prices and features for new products, bidding
              in
auctions, etc.  In previous research we discovered a mathematical
              formula
which explains how people appear to learn from experience, but
              the
numerical details of the formula (its "parameters) seem to vary
              from
situation to situation, as if people are learning in different ways.
              We
therefore propose to explore why these parameters seem to vary.
              In
addition, most mathematical theories of strategic learning assume
              that
people only look back at past experiences. We also propose to extend
              these
theories to allow for people who realize that other people are
              learning
from experience, and are able to therefore outguess what others will
              do
based on what happened in the past. If players are "sophisticated",
              in
this sense, it pays for them to take actions that are not perfect in
              the
near-term, to "teach" other players who are learning to take actions
              which
will benefit the "teachers" in the long-term. This teaching can
              be
beneficial for the teacher but bad for society (e.g., when firms
              scare
away innovative competitors by threatening illegal retaliation),
              or
beneficial for everyone (e.g., when firms reassure others that they can
              be
trusted). Our research develops a precise mathematical theory of
              how
sophisticated players behave and when it pays for them to teach.  We
              use
the theory to explain observations from experiments and predicts
              whether
teaching will occur in new situations.
