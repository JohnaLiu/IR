Abstract    :
              This project deals with methods to prepare longer peptides and small proteins,
              where a major deficiency appears in the application of current methods to the
              coupling steps.  An ancillary concern are protective groups for such amino acid
              residues as histidine and arginine, particularly where shelf-stability is
              concerned.  Attention will be directed toward new arginine protective groups
              that do not release cationic species during acidic deprotection steps. 
              Coupling strategies include the discovery of reagents that are compatible with
              solution as well as solid phase peptide synthesis.

With this Award, the
              Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Synthesis Program
              supports the research of Professor Louis A. Carpino of the University of
              Massachusetts, Amherst.  Professor Carpino explores ways to combine relatively
              small groups of amino acids into larger assemblages known as peptides and
              proteins.  These have profound implications in the area of biotechnology, but
              their synthesis is often quite difficult.  With the continued growth in the
              demand for peptides to probe biological research questions, these studies are
              of practical significance.
