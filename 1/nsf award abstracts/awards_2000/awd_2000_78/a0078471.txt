Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is developing a novel
              electrobiochemical leaching (EBL) approach to recover copper from chalcopyrite,
              providing an alternative to smelting.  Chalcopyrite is the most common copper
              ore, yet it is difficult to process hydrometallurgically because it passivates
              due to formation of refractory surface layers.  The EBL approach in Phase 1 was
              shown to prevent this passivation and to result in faster and more complete
              copper extraction than conventional bioleaching approaches.  The Phase II
              research objectives are to: 1) demonstrate the versatility of the process by
              determining the extent of copper extraction from different sources of
              chalcopyrite ore; 2) determine the optimum bioreactor configurations for the
              EBL approach; and 3) make a large laboratory scale (50 to 100 kg) demonstration
              of the process for determining preliminary process economics.  The research
              will measure the extent of copper extraction and extraction kinetics by EBL,
              including the determination of metallurgical balances.

The results of the
              Phase II research will provide the data required to establish preliminary
              economic feasibility of the process and to convince investors or operators
              (mining company) to support a pilot scale demonstration.  If successful, the
              EBL approach will provide a new technology in mineral extractions that will
              open additional reserves of copper in the US and elsewhere and reduce smelting
              of copper.
