Abstract    :
              With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Cell
              Biology Program are supporting a workshop on the "Frontiers in Glycoscience." 
              The workshop will be organized by Dr. Laura L Kiessling of the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin and by Dr. Gerald W. Hart of the
              Department of Biological Chemistry at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  
              The workshop, to be held May 4-5, 2000 at the Foundation,  will involve
              approximately twenty Scientists from the USA.  The focus of the event will be
              an exploration of the future of glycoscience research  and of the role of
              biology and chemistry in this important area.
