Abstract    :
              The central goals of this project are to develop and apply new statistical
              techniques to examine behavioral correlations across different contexts, and
              their effects on individual performance (survival, feeding rate, mating
              success) across contexts.  For example, for aggression level, although all
              individuals alter their aggression levels depending on the situation, do the
              same individuals tend to be more aggressive than others across a range of
              situations?  If so, how do these consistent aggression levels influence
              performance in the different situations? Experiments will examine behavioral
              and performance correlations: 1) across social and ecological contexts
              (different densities, sex ratios and levels of predation risk); 2) over a
              lifetime (correlating juvenile versus adult behavior); and 3) across genders
              (between male and female siblings). Experiments will focus on an insect,
              Aquarius remigis, that is ideal for generating the large amounts of data
              required to illustrate the new methods.

Although it is clear that humans and
              some well-studied mammals exhibit correlated behaviors across contexts (i.e.,
              personality types or behavioral syndromes), it is only now becoming clear that
              parallel behavioral correlations occur in other animals.  The techniques and
              insights generated by this project should advance our understanding of the
              ecological and evolutionary significance of behavioral correlations.
