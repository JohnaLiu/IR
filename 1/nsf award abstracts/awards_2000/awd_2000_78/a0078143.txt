The research of this proposal is directed at obtaining a
              better understanding of how ligand/receptor interactions involving estrogen
              receptors control a wide array of biological processes.  This project is based
              on the premise that to gain this knowledge it is necessary to understand the
              molecular binding events associated with small ligand/receptor interactions.
              Structural data suggest that agonist and antagonist ligands alter the estrogen
              receptor binding activity for regulatory proteins by modifying the
              conformational state of the receptor. BIACORE, a surface plasmon resonance
              (SPR) optical biosensor, is being employed to monitor directly the dynamics of
              ligand/receptor complex formation and to characterize the functional states
              imposed by different ligands. Preliminary dynamic data on ligand binding
              interactions demonstrate that agonist and antagonist ligands bind to estrogen
              receptor via distinct kinetic pathways. In this project, these kinetic pathways
              will be quantified and by so doing will provide critical information for
              understanding complex formation and relating structure to function.
