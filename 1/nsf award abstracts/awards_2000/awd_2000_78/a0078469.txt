Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an
              electrochemical method specific to recycling photovoltaic modules, which
              contain extremely low quantities of hazardous metals in large bulk-streams.  It
              uses an innovative closed-loop approach to remove, separate, and regenerate
              semiconductor films in a single compact system, and do it with minimum waste. 
              Phase I identified key process parameters, focusing on efficient removal and
              recovery of semiconductors from devices.  Retrieval of sulfur-free cadmium
              telluride demonstrated method feasibility.  Phase II will design a practical
              system to recycle the entire module for in-plant or centralized applications. 
              It will identify the optimum parameters to delaminate modules, dissolve
              semiconductors, regenerate useful semiconductor precursor films, and re-utilize
              the electrolyte.  The research will lead to a viable prototype recycling
              capability featuring low cost, high efficiency, low cycle-time, and production
              line amenability.  Converting defective panels into efficient modules will lead
              to rapid turn-around and high production yields.

Potential commercial
              applications are expected in the photovoltaic industry with a solution to
              managing hazardous waste disposal and improvement in module production yield. 
              It has short-term applications for recycling other end-of-life products such as
              flat panel displays, infrared detectors, and mirror scrap.  Benefits are
              anticipated in increased productivity, large savings in disposal costs,
              recovery of scarce raw materials, and enhanced commercial success of the
              emerging cadmium telluride photovoltaic industry, which has grown 50-fold in
              production capacity within two years.
