Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania will 
              acquire a time-resolved, step-scan Fourier-transform spectrometer.  This
              instrument will support research in a number of areas, including a) studies on
              adsorption and reaction kinetics on metal surfaces; b) dynamics of biologically
              relevant electron transfer reactions; and c) reaction pathways in molecular
              size cavities of zeolites.  

The general effectiveness of Fourier transform
              spectroscopic techniques in academic and industrial research has been firmly
              established.  Many advanced spectroscopic courses now routinely include the
              teaching of FT spectroscopy.  The time-resolved capability is one of the most
              important recent developments in FT spectroscopy that is rapidly being explored
              for all kinds of research.  Recent applications include biological, polymer,
              and environmental studies.  These studies will open up the application of
              time-resolved FT spectroscopy in unexplored areas such as surface science,
              zeolite chemistry and bioinorganic chemistry.
