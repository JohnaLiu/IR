Abstract    :
              This project will explore the controlled aggregation of cyanine dyes on nucleic
              acid nanotemplates.  The end result is the spontaneous assembly of chiral,
              helical aggregates of cyanine dimers.  The dimensions of the aggregate are
              controlled by varying the length of the DNA.  The properties of the aggregates
              will be studied using a variety of spectroscopic techniques, including UV-vis
              absorption, circular dichroism and fluorescence methods, and by stopped flow
              spectroscopy.  Collaborative efforts will explore the possibilities of X-ray
              crystallographic studies of these aggregates, as well as a theoretical
              treatment of the electronic interactions among the cyanine dyes.

With this
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Synthesis
              Program supports the research of Professor Bruce A. Armitage of Carnegie Mellon
              University.  Professor Armitage will investigate the properties of certain dye
              molecules to assemble on a template consisting of the DNA helix.  Thus
              assembled, these aggregates can themselves serve as the template for the
              generation of complex structures that retain some of the characteristics
              initially imparted by the DNA.  The properties of these assemblies will be
              studied as will the dynamics of their formation.
