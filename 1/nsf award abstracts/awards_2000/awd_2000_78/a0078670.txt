Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on enhancing
              maintenance operations scheduling methodologies with condition assessment and
              diagnostic tools to produce an 'integrated' maintenance management system.  The
              company has developed scheduling tools that allocate maintenance resources on
              the basis of elapsed calendar time and unit utilization.  This project will
              augment these tools with condition assessment modules.   If successful, the
              result would be a generally applicable system combining condition, time, and
              utilization as drivers for the maintenance process.  The project will develop
              algorithms for condition assessment based on signal processing and feature
              extraction using both conventional sensors such as accelerometers, and 'next
              generation' sensors such as eddy current devices, fiber optic sensors, and MEMS
              sensors.  These methods, when applied a maintenance service program, will lead
              to new methodologies for the synthesis of integrated diagnostics techniques and
              for the design of new hardware and software systems to realize those techniques
              for a wide range of practical applications.
