Abstract    :
              This project will transform the Tree of Life from a collection of static web
              pages containing information about biodiversity and phylogeny into a dynamic
              system using a relational database. The Tree of Life Project is a global,
              collaborative effort of more than 300 biologists. The project's goals range
              from informal science education to serving the research needs of systematic
              biologists, as well as other life scientists whose work benefits from an
              understanding of the special characteristics and phylogenetic relationships of
              organisms. In order to convert the Tree into a database-driven system, the
              project will design database and associated display and data entry modules. The
              content of the Tree's current pages will then be moved into this database, and
              customizable, open-source tools will be created for the dynamic presentation of
              information and for efficient entry of new data into the system. The database
              will be constructed to allow communication between the Tree and other
              biological databases. The major benefits of the Tree's new format are expansion
              of the project's reach through data sharing with other database efforts and
              novel flexibility in presentation of information allowing us to better serve
              the needs of diverse users.
