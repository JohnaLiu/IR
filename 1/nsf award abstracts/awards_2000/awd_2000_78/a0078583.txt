Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new
              computer peripheral: a Volumetric Image Display system that displays 3D images
              in a real space.  Many viewers can walk around the display and see the 3D
              images from omni-directions without special glasses.  The overall business
              objectives corresponding to this project are to develop and implement the
              technologies required for building the VID product, to demonstrate the market
              viability, and to complete the financial preparation for Phase III.  In order
              to speed up commercialization, a Basic Model product will be completed in year
              1.  It will feature a flexible configuration and good specifications to address
              the initial need in various fields.  Marketing will then begin in year 2 to
              test market and seek business alliances, using the Basic Model as a
              demonstration platform as well as an evaluation product.  A low-volume
              manufacturing procedure will be established to support initial sales.  In year
              2, techniques that further improve product color and gray scale will be
              developed and demonstrated.  We already have a Phase III funding commitment. 
              Based on the demonstrated market viability and technical readiness, a new
              business plan will be prepared to raise additional funding commitments to
              complete the finance preparation for Phase III.  The marketing goals also
              include obtaining at least one development contract from a major corporation,
              as part of the Phase III finance.  Market analysis indicates great commercial
              potential in four major segments: medical, computer aided design and
              engineering, visual data analysis, and computer gaming.
