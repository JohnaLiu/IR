Abstract    :
              Michael Morse of the University of Utah is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his investigations of
              chemical bonding and electronic structure of diatomic and polyatomic transition
              metal clusters with electronic spectroscopy.  The measurements will be made on
              supersonic expansions of laser ablated metals using laser induced fluorescence,
              resonant two photon ionization and dispersed fluorescence spectroscopies. 
              State symmetries, bond energies and lengths and vibrational frequencies will be
              determined for: (1) a series of 3d transition metal silicides and (2) 4 and 5d
              homonuclear transition metal diatomics .  The studies will be extended to
              include a series of metal clusters including those containing aluminum, copper,
              silver, niobium and silicon.

Metals have extremely important applications in
              catalysis.  This study will obtain spectroscopic information about diatomic
              molecules and clusters of metal atoms to enable the strengths of bonds and
              other properties of the molecules to be determined.  The properties of the
              diatomic molecules will be compared with those calculated using current
              theories and those of the larger clusters will form a connection to the
              properties of the bulk solid.
