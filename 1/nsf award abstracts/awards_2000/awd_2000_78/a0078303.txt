The establishment of the three germ layers is a major issue
              for every embryo.  While the ectoderm appears to be the default state of the
              embryo, the mesoderm and endoderm arise through the use of inductive signals. 
              Within the last decade, many of the key signaling molecules that induce the
              formation of the mesendoderm in the vertebrate embryo have been identified, but
              the mechanisms that precisely subdivide the germ layers are still largely
              unknown.  This laboratory has identified a new T-box gene, TbxM, which is
              proposed to play a major role in the early patterning of the mesoderm and
              endoderm of zebrafish embryos.  The role of TbxM in the inductive process
              leading to mesendoderm formation will be defined, and its interaction with
              other proposed maternal components will be studied.  Finally, the mechanism of
              localization of TbxM transcripts during the early cleavage stages will be
              analyzed.  These studies will provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms
              that pattern the early zebrafish
