Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project plans to develop a new
              fiber based chemical sensor technology that can be used to make rapid trace
              chemical analysis of gaseous and liquid environments without the need for time
              consuming sample extraction and preparation. This new miniature sensing
              technology will combine aspects of fiber optics, enhanced absorption analysis
              techniques, and ultimately wireless internet communications.  This technology
              will provide commercial and government users a chemical monitoring system which
              can be inexpensively networked over wide areas. Such a network of sensors can
              be monitored in real time from any secured computer via the Internet, providing
              real time information relating to chemical processing and transport, as well as
              for the monitoring of leaks and hazardous accidents. Such a system could be
              used as a warning network for large plant facilities and neighborhoods.
              

This technology is being developed for commercial application in several
              areas in collaboration with an established fiber sensor supplier for trace
              detection of chemicals around storage facilities and industrial facilities.
