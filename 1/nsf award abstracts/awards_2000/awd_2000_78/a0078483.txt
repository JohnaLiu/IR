Abstract    :
              Sexual differences are widespread in animals, including humans, and biologists
              recognize three mechanisms for their evolution: 1. Sexual selection resulting
              from mate competition and mate choice; 2: Natural selection resulting from
              sexual differences in reproductive roles of males; and 3. Natural selection
              resulting from competition between the sexes for food.  Field experiments under
              natural conditions will be used to examine the roles of natural and sexual
              selection in the maintenance of sexual dimorphism.

Although studies
              demonstrate that sexual selection and reproductive role mechanisms operate in
              natural populations, almost nothing is known about the role of food competition
              in the maintenance of sexual dimorphisms.  The problem is that in many species,
              sexual differences in diet are often associated with sexual differences in
              size, making it unclear whether dietary differences are the cause or the
              consequence of dimorphism.  The proposed studies avoid this problem by focusing
              on sexual dimorphisms in feeding anatomy: the beak size and shape of a
              hummingbird, which can be matched to the size and shape of the flowers the
              birds visit. Consequently, the proposed studies will be the first to
              unambiguously link sexual differences in feeding morphology to sexual
              differences in feeding performances at natural food sources, and to separate
              the effects of natural from sexual selection on body size and anatomy.
