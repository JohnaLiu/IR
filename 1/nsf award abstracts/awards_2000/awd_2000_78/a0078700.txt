Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT AGARWAL

This is a study of the mechanism and intermediates in the
              destruction of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in combustion
              emissions using a pulsed corona discharge.  In situ laser-induced fluorescence
              (LIF) will be used to study the behavior of hydrogen atoms, hydroxyl radials,
              and carbon monoxide in the plasma-induced destruction of nitrogen oxides in the
              emissions from a coal-field fluidized bed combustion (FBC) system. 
              

Although corona discharge is regarded as a promising technology for control
              of nitrogen and sulfur oxides from both mobile and stationary sources, previous
              studies have looked only at the stable end products.  This is the first attempt
              to investigate the mechanism of the process and provide a rational basis for
              optimizing the system.
