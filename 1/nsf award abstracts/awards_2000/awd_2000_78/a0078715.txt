Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research program are to explore the physics of a new
              radiation mechanism and to demonstrate its viability as a source of high power
              radiation.  In particular, an intense laser pulse will be used to excite a
              laser wakefield propagating across a DC magnetic field.  The resulting
              wakefield couples to electromagnetic radiation at the plasma/vacuum boundary. 
              It is anticipated that teraHertz radiation at the level of one megaWatt will be
              generated and detected in pulses lasting a few hundred picoseconds.
