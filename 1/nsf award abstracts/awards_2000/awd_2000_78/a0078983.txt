Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              University of California in Riverside will acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer.
              This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) the
              synthesis, isolation and structure determination of biologically active
              molecules; b) synthesis and identification of chemicals used for intra- and
              interspecific communication, c) regulation of intermediary metabolism in
              invertebrate animals, especially insects; d) identification of the products of
              the atmospherically important reactions of anthropogenic and biogenic volatile
              organic compounds; and e) the investigation of the gas-phase atmospheric
              reactions of polycyclic aromatic compounds.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available for the elucidation of
              the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
              characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
              dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
              frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a
              number of areas including biochemistry and environmental chemistry.
