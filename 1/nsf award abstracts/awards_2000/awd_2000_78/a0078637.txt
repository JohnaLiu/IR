Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on optimization
              and scale-up of an aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) field emitter technology
              that could be used for practical applications.  Materials have been identified
              that are very promising to deal with the wide-band-gap for field-emission
              applications.  These materials have low to negative electron affinity.  The
              Phase I project demonstrated various AlGaN compositions that possessed
              different doping levels for field emission properties.  The Phase II project
              will carry out a detailed and systematic parametric optimization using
              closely-coupled theoretical modeling and experimentation to produce rugged,
              low-voltage III-V nitride field emitters.  The project will utilize the
              company's deposition chamber and will demonstrate the effects of composition,
              doping, ion implantation, substrate temperature and other parameters.  Effects
              of microstructure and conductivity of grain boundaries will also be
              investigated to develop better understanding of the AlGaN cold cathode
              technology.

The commerical potential for this technology is a compact
              addressable X-ray source.  Additional applications will include electronic
              coolers, electron guns, solar-blind UV detectors, large-area lighting and
              flat-panel displays.
