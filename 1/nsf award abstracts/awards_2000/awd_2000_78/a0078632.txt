Abstract    :
              Philip Pechukas of Columbia University is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to explore analytical and computational aspects
              of quantum dynamics in many-body systems.  Equilibrium time correlation
              functions, which contain all the information needed to describe the dynamics of
              systems sufficiently close to thermal equilibrium, are difficult to calculate. 
              In the first project, imaginary time calculations will be extended with the aim
              of enabling accurate evaluation of quantum time correlation functions.  In the
              second project, development of a quantum analog of the Smoluchlowski equation
              will be explored.  Also, an entire class of quantum Brownian motion models will
              be examined.  In the final two projects, the effects of various kinds of
              correlated initial conditions on system dynamics will be studied, and a quantum
              approach to the fluctuating barrier model will be initiated. 

The
              description and simulation of complex chemical processes at very accurate
              levels requires the application of quantum mechanics, specifically the quantum
              dynamics of many-body systems.  This research addresses a number of issues in
              the basic theory of quantum dynamics, including rates of decay to chemical
              equilibrium and kinetic processes inside a fluctuating protein.
