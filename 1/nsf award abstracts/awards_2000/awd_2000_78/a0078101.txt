Abstract    :
              This project, sponsored by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
              continues research on utilization of  sol-gel derived xerogels for chemical
              analysis.  The research, conducted by Dr. Frank V. Bright and his students at
              SUNY-Buffalo, focuses on the behavior and performance of enzymes, antibodies,
              and signaling proteins that are sequestered in xerogels.  These  protein doped
              xerogels are used as platforms for developing discrete and distributed
              biosensors.  The experimental aproach first develops a fundamental
              understanding of how the analytical performance of xerogel entrapped proteins
              is influenced by the the choice of xerogel host matrix chemistry, co-dopants,
              and preparation protocol.  The next step determines precisely how the xerogel
              host matrix chemistry, co-dopants, and preparation protocol affect 1) the
              biorecognition element's dynamics and 2) the environment around the sites
              within the biorecognition element that are responsible for producing 
              fluorescence in the presence of the target analyte.  Finally, the project uses
              results from the steps above to produce biosensors and distributed biosensor
              arrays that are more robust, stable, and reliable than those that are currently
              available.  

Use of the sensors developed by this project could result in
              faster, more reliable, and less costly clinical analyses.
