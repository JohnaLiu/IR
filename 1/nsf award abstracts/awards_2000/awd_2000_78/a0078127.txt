Abstract    :
              When humans reach to grasp an object, many different combinations of
muscles
              and joints can be used than are strictly necessary to achieve
accurate hand
              motion and final hand placement.  Thus, when reaching to
the same location,
              two general strategies are possible: a) choose one
set of joint motions and
              use the same set every time, or b) use a range
of different joint motions,
              each of which takes the hand to the same
location.  Using multiple, equivalent
              (i.e., in terms of the goal),
joint combinations confers advantages under
              special circumstances,
such as when a movement is unexpectedly disturbed. 
              Scientists do not
know the extent to which the nervous system uses this
              strategy during
routine tasks.  This project will address this question by
              studying
reaching and pointing to target locations throughout the workspace.
              
Motion of the arm and hand will be measured using high-speed video
analysis.
               The experiments are designed to understand how factors such
as the subject's
              level of skill, the presence or absence of vision, and
the direction and
              curvature of the reach, influence which strategy is
used.  Formal modeling of
              the nervous system's control of reaching will
be used to help explain the
              experimental results and generate
predictions for future work.
