Abstract    :
              Deficits in word finding and language comprehension are a significant problem
              for adult readers with a history of developmental language disorder (DLD;
              Condus et al, 1986; Felton, 1993; German, 1987, 1989; Hyde Wright et al, 1993;
              Rudel et al, 1982). Much of the research designed to study these language
              deficits in children and adults has preferentially looked for functional or
              anatomical anomalies in the left cerebral hemisphere (LH; Galaburda, Sherman,
              Rosen, Aboitiz, & Geschwind, 1985; Cohen, Campbell, & Yaghmai, 1989; Galaburda,
              1989; Hynd, Semrud-Clikeman, Lorys, Novey, & Eliopulos, 1990). However, in the
              neuropsychology literature, a growing body of empirical work strongly suggests
              that the right cerebral hemisphere (RH) also plays an important role in
              language comprehension (for a review see Beeman & Chiarello, 1998).
              Furthermore, recent pilot work (Atchley, Story, & Buchanan, in review) suggests
              that lexical level processing in the RH is impaired in adult readers who have
              experienced DLD.

This research project applies this new understanding of the
              role of the RH in language comprehension to the study of adult readers with
              DLD. There are two goals served by these studies.  First, to determine the
              underlying functional neuroanatomy that leads to language comprehension
              deficits in adults with DLD. Secondly, to better model how these lexical level
              reading difficulties might contribute to higher order discourse integration and
              sentence comprehension problems. The research will add to our understanding of
              both the behavioral and physiological dissimilarities between adults with a
              history of DLD and adults with normal reading skills.
