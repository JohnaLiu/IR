Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will result in
              the development of two detection systems utilizing Surface Enhanced Raman
              Spectroscopy (SERS) capable of rapidly measuring the concentration of cyanide,
              a highly toxic substance used in large quantities in the extractive metals
              industry. 

A portable system will be well suited for use in the field for
              on-site measurements of cyanide for environmental compliance monitoring. An
              automated system will be useful for the measurement of cyanide levels in
              process control of precious metal extractive processes, and in monitoring wells
              for environmental compliance. Current methods of cyanide analysis give either
              the total amount of cyanide present in all forms, or that of free cyanide in
              combination with cyanide in weak acid dissociable (WAD) metal complexes. Our
              method of cyanide determination will be markedly superior to these methods
              because it will yield the concentration of free cyanide in addition to that of
              WAD cyanide. This has very important practical and economic implications for
              the precious metals extractive industries (e.g., gold and silver mining), since
              it is free cyanide which is of importance in optimizing metal extraction
              efficiency, and it is free cyanide which is the species of primary interest
              from an environmental regulatory standpoint.
