Developmental biology demands the integration of cell
              biology,
genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry.  The exciting progress
              of
the past decade has depended upon bringing together people who work with
              a
variety of organisms, including yeast, worms, flies, and vertebrates
              to
learn about the molecules and principles held in common among
              these
seemingly diverse organisms.  Despite all the excitement in the
              field,
there are relatively few meetings organized to emphasize the
              increasingly
obvious relationships among developmental events previously
              viewed as
distinct.

Our specific objectives are to assemble a group of
              scientists with broad 
expertise in modern molecular analysis of development,
              have a series 
of talks on up to date research, and have about 120 other
              attendees present
posters describing their research.  The meeting will be held
              on the campus
of the University of California, Santa Cruz on July 21st to July
              26th,
2000.

There are two major goals of the meeting.  The first is to
              teach
each other.  The planned program will be a superb course in
              advanced
developmental biology, and help those working with each particular
              organism
to keep abreast of exciting new developments in the study of
              other
organisms.  This will important not just for established investigators,
              but
also for the many students and postdoctoral fellows who will attend
              the
meeting.
