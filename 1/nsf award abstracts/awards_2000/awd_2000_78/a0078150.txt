Abstract    :
              Speciation, the evolutionary process by which one species splits into two, has
              created the staggering biodiversity that we see in the world today.  Behavior
              plays a large role in speciation.  Animals usually have signals - colors,
              songs, or smells - that indicate identity.  Females attend to these signals
              closely when choosing a mate, and avoid mating with males of other species. 
              Understanding how these communication systems regulate reproductive
              interactions is important to understanding why there are so many
              species.

Information from DNA sequences will be used to reconstruct the
              phylogeny - the historical pattern of splitting - that produced the species in
              the frog genus Physalaemus.  The phylogeny will be used to interpret
              differences among species in calls, vocal tract structure, hormone profiles,
              behavioral responses to call differences, and the neurobiology of the auditory
              centers in the brain.  The goal is to deduce how differences in
              species-specific signals and differences in female preferences for these
              signals have evolved.
