Abstract    :
              Recent research has suggested that plasma turbulence and the associated
              transport of particles may also be consistent with a state of self-organized
              criticality (SOC).  However, unambiguous identification of an SOC state for
              turbulence in plasmas has not been made, and existing evidence remains
              primarily suggestive.  The universality of SOC-like systems, the ability to
              explain non-local phenomena and their independence of detailed mode
              characteristics motivate the current research effort.  The primary goal of the
              project is to search for long-range correlation of turbulent transport events
              and to contrast and compare in detail experimental measurements with the
              predictions of complex dynamic theory.  The work will be performed by a
              combined theoretical and experimental team, with experiments being carried out
              on the new Large Plasma Device under construction at the University of
              California, Los Angeles.
