Abstract

Rhythmic motor patterns such as walking, swimming and
              digestion of food are fundamental behaviors in all living animals. These
              behaviors originate in electrical signals produced by complex networks of the
              central nervous system. The underlying mechanisms that generate and coordinate
              these electrical rhythmic patterns are only now beginning to be understood. We
              study rhythmic pattern generation in a small neuronal circuit, the pyloric
              network of the lobster Panulirus interruptus. This network is responsible for
              controlling the muscles involved in chewing and filtering of food in the
              lobster. This network is an ideal model system for understanding rhythmic motor
              activity due to its experimental accessibility and small number of
              neurons.
	We focus on understanding how the pyloric network output is shaped
              by the dynamic behavior of its synapses. We record neuronal waveforms during an
              ongoing pyloric rhythm in vitro. We then play back these realistic waveforms
              into the network in
controlled conditions with the aid of a computer.  The
              synaptic response to these waveforms are analyzed and used to build
              computational models. These model synapses are, in turn, interfaced with the
              biological network in real time and thus tested directly in an experimental
              setting. The goal of this work is to further our understanding of the neural
              basis of behavior by building realistic models that accurately reproduce the
              behavior.
