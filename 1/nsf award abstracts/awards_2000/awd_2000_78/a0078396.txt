This proposal is for the support of the methodological
              training of a cultural anthropologist. Specifically, Stone seeks training in
              crop biotechnology, a first step in a larger agenda for cross-cultural research
              on genetically modified crops (GM crops). Genetically modified crops are
              becoming an important component of crop regimes not only in the industrialized
              countries, but also in the developing world. Anthropologists are seeking to
              make contributions to various debates about GM crops, specifically concerning
              the social and political implications and ramifications of these new crops and
              their agricultural sustainability. The PI is a specialist in agriculture who
              seeks to gain invaluable training in the biological aspects of GM crops. He
              will undertake a traineeship and do directed readings at the International
              Laboratory for Tropical Agricultural Biotechnology at the University of
              Missouri, as well as work with Professor Ralph Quatrano, Chairman of the Dept.
              of Biology, Washington University.
