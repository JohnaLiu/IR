Abstract    :
              Simulation of the propagation of intense optical pulses in gas and plasma media
              is undertaken using a previously developed code WAKE.  The research is done in
              collaboration with some ongoing experiments in dielectric capillaries using
              ultra-intense, ultra-short laser pulses at the University of Maryland.
