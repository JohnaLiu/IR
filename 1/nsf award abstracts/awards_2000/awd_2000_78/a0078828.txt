Abstract    :
              With this award to Prof. Jay S. Siegel of the University of California, San
              Diego, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support
              of annual Workshops in Physical Organic Chemistry, which have taken place since
              1981.   The workshops in this three-year cycle will be chaired in turn by Dr.
              Siegel, Dr. Barbara Imperiali of M.I.T. in Cambridge, Mass., and by Dr. Jeffrey
              Moore at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champagne.   The purpose of the
              workshops is to bring together leaders in the field and young faculty early in
              their careers, to discuss their latest ideas and results in research and
              education in an informal setting, with lots of opportunities for interaction
              and discussion.   The meetings are intentionally kept small (ca. 20
              participants), and blocks of unstructured time made available to maximize
              interactions.   Attendees are selected by the Chairs to represent a spectrum of
              research interests, and  sizes, types and locations of institutions, and to
              include both women and underrepresented minorities.   In order to give as many
              people as possible the opportunity to participate, no one is invited more than
              once or twice in any 10 year period.

Subdisciplines represented at the
              workshop include organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis,
              photochemistry and the chemistry of reactive intermediates, synthesis,
              bioorganic chemistry, and theoretical organic chemistry.
