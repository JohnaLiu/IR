Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
              a rapid, sensitive and highly specific method for monoclonal antibody
              production and hybridoma cell line development by combining single
cell gel
              microdrop (GMD) encapsulation technology, a novel protein capture format, and
              fluorescence activated cell sorting.  Using insulin as a model antigen, Phase I
              studies demonstrated that individual cells,
which comprised a 1%
              sub-population of a heterogeneous population, could be rapidly isolated based
              on both secretion level and antigen specificity of the secreted antibody. 
              Phase II research will optimize the assay format by permitting simultaneous
              analysis of other antibody properties, including antibody isotype and blocking
              properties.  Using newly fused hybridomas, Phase II research will isolate and
              enrich productive
clones and compare results with conventional methods which
              require use of time consuming and labor intensive limiting dilution
              cloning.

Monoclonal antibodies are widely used as research, therapeutic,
              diagnostic, and imaging reagents, and are increasingly used in the emerging
              field of proteomics for discovering new drug targets and locating disease
              specific markers. The GMD method will reduce production time and costs, improve
              antibody quality and yield, and permit isolation of rare cells.
