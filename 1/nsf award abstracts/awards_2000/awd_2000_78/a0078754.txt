This Small Business
              Innovation Research Phase II project advances the development of an improved  
              catalytic reactor, based on a novel catalyst substrate design, for the
              preferential oxidation (PROX) of carbon monoxide in a hydrogen rich feed.  The
              Phase I objectives were fully met and demonstrated the viability of this
              catalyst substrate for substantial reductions in the size, weight and cost of
              the PROX component and also identified parameters for designing a full scale
              PROX reactor.  This Phase II effort will focus on catalyst optimization and
              integration of a PROX reactor based on the catalyst substrate in a fuel
              processor system for automotive fuel cell applications.

This potential
              breakthrough could significantly advance fuel processing technology for
              automotive fuel cell applications.  The proposed technology has the potential
              to provide near-order of magnitude improvements in fuel processor volume,
              weight and cost, with a broad range of potential spin off applications to other
              catalytic reactors.  Success with the PROX reactor would lead to exploring use
              of this substrate for other components in the fuel processor, including the
              reformer and the Water Gas Shift reactors.
