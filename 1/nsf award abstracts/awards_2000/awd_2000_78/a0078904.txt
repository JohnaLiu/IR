Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will integrate a
              novel, inexpensive device to measure tool dynamics with a general purpose
              analysis program that will optimize the use of high speed machining centers as
              a routine shop floor practice.  High speed machining is often limited by
              chatter conditions.  These conditions depend on system dynamics and cutting
              conditions.  The product to be developed will provide an integrated
              hardware/software solution to assist users in selecting optimal spindle speeds
              and tool depths without the intervention of experts or specialized equipment.
              The product will handle general tool geometries, tool paths and in-process part
              geometries working in conjunction with an industrial grade NC verification
              program.  The program will specifically provide recommendations under low tool
              immersion (light cut) conditions that are commonly used to avoid tool wear in
              hard materials.  Novel aspects include: (1) the study of chatter under
              transient conditions; (2) sculptured surface parts; (3) a new analytical
              solution that provides important physical insights under low tool immersion
              conditions; (4) a new simulation model that is not restricted to
              uni-directional feed; and (5) the extension of a new measurement device to
              provide full tool dynamic data.
