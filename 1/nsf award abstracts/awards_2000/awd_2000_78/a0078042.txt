Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at South Dakota State University
              will upgrade its mass spectrometer control and data systems. This equipment
              will enhance research in a number of areas including a) environmental chemical
              studies of organic contaminants; b) organic geochemistry; c) organic synthesis
              of dendrimeric materials and novel macrocyclic ligands; d) structural
              elucidation of natural products; and e) the total synthesis and asymmetric
              synthesis of natural products.  

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used
              to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions
              of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The
              results from these studies will have an impact in a number of areas including
              materials chemistry, environmental chemistry and geochemistry.
