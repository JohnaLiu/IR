Abstract    :
              The goal of this effort is to relate the composition of acetylene plasmas to
              processing variables used in depositing plasma-polymerized acetylene films. 
              These films are then investigated as adhesives for rubber-to-metal bonding. 
              Plasma composition is also correlated with such film properties as adhesion,
              durability of adhesion, and corrosion inhibition.  Plasma-polymerized acetylene
              films are deposited onto steel substrates in a microwave reactor using argon or
              other inert gases as carrier gases.  The composition and morphology of the
              films are controlled through external variables such as power, pressure,
              monomer flow rate, and RF bias of the substrate.  Plasma composition is
              determined by residual gas analysis (RGA), optical emission spectroscopy (OES),
              and time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (TOFMS).  Films are characterized using
              reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIR), X-ray photoelectron
              spectroscopy (XPS), variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), and
              atomic force microscopy (AFM).  Film properties are determined with
              electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), fracture mechanics tests, and
              industrial test methods.

This is a collaboration involving the University of
              Dayton (plasma characterization), the University of Cincinnati (plasma
              polymerization and film characterization), the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company
              (film properties), and the Autonomous National University of Mexico (corrosion
              inhibition).
