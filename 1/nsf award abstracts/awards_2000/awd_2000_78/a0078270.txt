Abstract    :
              The objectives of this proposal are to develop informatics tools to characterize
              the voids, pockets and tunnels that characterize protein surfaces and to
              construct a database of protein surface maps.  The topographic of the protein
              helps to define the binding regions essential for the protein's functions. 
              Understanding protein surface properties is basic to understanding interactions
              with other proteins as well as other small ligands.  Such information may
              provide a way to identify active sites.  The tools generate not only the maps
              of the surface, with area and volume measurement, but also measure the
              accessibility of binding pockets from the outside of the molecule and the
              texture of the surfaces.  The description can be computed also at different
              levels of resolution. This research has the potential for linking structure
              with function by providing information about the possible sites of interaction
              between and among molecules.  In addition, the work will provide an educational
              resource for understanding protein geometry.
