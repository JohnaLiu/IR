Abstract    :
              This project has as its goal the development of effective and general catalysts
              for the asymmetric Heck reaction.  Work in this direction focuses on the use of
              elaborated BINAP-phosphine ligands where significant enantioselectivity was
              demonstrated in an acyclic substrate.  Possible transition states of this class
              of phosphine ligand in asymmetric cyclization were suggested to aid in the
              rational design of additional catalysts.  Application in alkaloid synthesis and
              the use of solid supported palladium complexes in asymmetric catalysis will
              also be investigated.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Program's Organic Synthesis Program supports the research of Professor Duy H.
              Hua of Kansas State University.  Professor Hua studies a particular type of
              reaction known as the Heck reaction, which has many potential applications in
              the synthesis of pharmaceutical molecules.  However, one weakness of this
              reaction is its inability to govern the three-dimensional aspect of molecular
              assembly.  Professor Hua has made strides in this direction, and will continue
              to do so with the support of the Organic Synthesis Program.
