Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project focuses on the
              improvement of spatial resolution in microwave microscopy, reducing in
              particular the measurement sampling area over which sheet resistance and
              dielectric permittivity at 1 GHz - 20 GHz can be determined with numerical
              accuracy.   A particular focus will be on proprietary semiconductor
              applications and on the imaging of dielectric properties.  Modifications of the
              existing prototype as required for this goal will lead to additional
              applications in fields of economic and academic importance, including the
              non-contact measurement of the electric field dependence and the frequency
              dependence of the dielectric permittivity at microwave frequencies.  Work at
              Neocera will include instrument modifications, test sample preparation, and a
              thorough analysis of the probe-sample interactions. Numerical simulations,
              semiconductor sample preparation, and comparison to an instrument based on a
              different feedback mechanism will be per-formed through a subcontract with the
              University of Maryland.  

The result of this Phase II SBIR will be an
              instrument developed for a particular (proprietary) semiconductor application,
              leading to a multi-million dollar market. In addition, the technology will be
              available for various research applications, with universities being potential
              customers.
