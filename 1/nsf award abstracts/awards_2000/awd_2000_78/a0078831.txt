Abstract    :
              With this award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports a
              proposal by Dr. Devens J. Gust from Arizona State University to provide travel
              funds to help junior U.S. scientists to attend the XVIII IUPAC Symposium on
              Photochemistry, to be held in Dresden, Germany from July 22-28, 2000.   The
              IUPAC Symposium, held biennually, is the major international meeting of
              photochemists.   It provides a forum for the dissemination of the latest
              scientific developments and concepts in photochemistry, a venue for interaction
              of photochemists from all over the world, and opportunities for new
              international contacts and collaborations.Travel to international meetings is
              difficult for junior scientists, particularly at the assistant professor level,
              because they lack sufficient funds for such travel.   This award will make it
              possible for seven junior scientists to attend and present papers or posters.  
              The selection of travel fund recipients will be based on a vita and an abstract
              of the proposed presentation from each applicant.   Selection will be made by a
              committee consisting of Dr. Gust, Prof. Silvia Braslavsky, the Conference
              Organizer, and Dr. Heinz Roth of Rutgers University.   Drs. Gust and Roth are
              the two U.S. members of the International Scientific Committee.
