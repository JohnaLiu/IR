              Abstract  9808327  Ecker   This research is providing new information about how
              plants perceive and relay signals from the plant hormone ethylene.  Ethylene
              plays an important role in plant development and is a major component of a
              plant's  response to stress. The role of ethylene is being elucidated using
              genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches.  Mutants of ethylene responses
              have been identified in Arabidopsis seedlings. This research is examining two
              mutants: EIN2 which encodes a membrane protein with similarity to putative ion
              transporter proteins, and EIN 3 and EIN-like genes encoding a family of nuclear
              proteins.  This research will look at these genes and proteins which interact
              with them during ethylene signaling.  The EIN3 genes are proposed to be
              regulators of transcription. Proteins which interact with these genes will be
              identified and their function in signaling examined.  This research will
              provide important information about the signal transduction pathway of the
              ethylene responses in plants.
