Abstract    :
              9724066  Childs    Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is produced mainly by pituitary
              gonadotropes or growth hormone cells.  All pituitary cell types have receptors
              for EGF as well, which suggests that this growth factor is an important
              regulator in the pituitary.  This study will focus on possible regulator roles
              for EGF in the reproductive system, specifically in controlling pituitary
              gonadotropes.  The first objective will be to test the hypothesis that EGF
              regulates cell division in gonadotropes.  This will be done with cell growth
              assays on cultures of purified gonadotropes (enriched to 90-95% gonadotropes). 
              Cytochemical assays will also be used to prove that the gonadotropes are
              dividing.  The second objective will be to learn if EGF affects differentiation
              of gonadotropes during diestrus as the cells are being prepared for the
              enhanced secretory activity needed for ovulation.  Studies for this second
              objective will also test EGF effects on the gonadotrope expression of estradiol
              receptors.  EGF receptors appear on 60% of gonadotropes before the estradiol
              receptors.  The PI will test the hypothesis that EGF works trough the EGF
              receptors to stimulate theh expression of estradiol receptors.  Progress in the
              field has already shown that EGF is important to the reproductive system as a
              growth factor.  It promotes the development and function of cells in both the
              gonads and the hypothalamus.  Little is known about its role in the pituitary,
              however.  This study is one of the few studies in the world that will define
              its role in the regulation of pituitary gonadotropes during the estrous cycle.
