Abstract    :
              Inelastic behavior of polymers under multiaxial compression 

0072195
The
              objective of this program is to investigate the inelastic response of polymeric
              materials under multiaxial compression, with pressures in the range of 1 GPa.
              Polycarbonate, polymethylmethacrylate and polyethylene are take to be examples
              to be examined. These polymers exhibit significant pressure sensitivity in
              their elastic, inelastic and viscoelastic response. These are also technically
              very important polymers, very much in commercial use. The main innovation
              presented in this proposal is a new experimental scheme of confined
              compression, where all the strain and stress components are carefully measured.
              The resulting deformation is macroscopically homogeneous and geometrically
              stable. Preliminary experiments have shown that the configuration works as
              expected. With this configuration, it is proposed to examine the pressure
              dependence of the initial modulus, yielding and inelastic behavior under
              multiaxial loading, and linear viscoelastic behavior of the three polymers
              listed above. It should be noted that the proposed experiments are "clean"
              experiments in the sense that no assumptions regarding the material behavior
              are embedded in interpreting the experimental results. Thus, the results can be
              used to provide checks on the many mechanistic as well as phenomenological
              theories of polymer behavior.
