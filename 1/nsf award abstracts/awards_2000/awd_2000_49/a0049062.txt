Abstract    :
              The goal of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is to apply utility
              theory to engineering design, including the consideration of uncertainty.  An
              aim is to address computational complexity using an efficient simulation
              technique referred to as Optimal Computing Budget Allocation.  This algorithm
              seeks to identify the optimal design under uncertainty through the elimination
              of undesired designs with minimal information, thereby obviating the need to do
              extensive computations on all design alternatives.

If successful, this
              method should provide a design framework that is flexible enough to address a
              wide variety of engineering design situations, and the method should provide a
              new set of design tools that explicitly incorporate uncertainty, while taking
              advantage of advancements in modeling and computing technology.
