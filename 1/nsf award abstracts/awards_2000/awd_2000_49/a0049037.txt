Abstract    :

This project will explore several fundamental questions in the area
              of noncommutative algebra: a general theory of quasideterminants,
              noncommutative flag and Plucker coordinates and their applications,
              noncommutative symmetric functions, continued fractions, applications to graph
              theory, and noncommutative integrable systems.

These areas find applications
              to automata theory and theoretical physics. Contemporary theoretical physics
              depends on algebraic systems that are not necessarily commutative like
              familar
algebraic systems.
