Substituting heart valve prostheses (HVP) are expected to
              function in human recipients for at least 10 years under normal physiological
              conditions.  Categorized as Class III medical devices, USFDA requires that HVP
              must be tested in a pulse simulator for 600 million cycles before the
              pre-market approval (PMA) can be considered.  HVP manufacturers have used
              accelerated testers of various designs to achieve this number of cycles on
              their products.  At the accelerated rate, the sample valves are subjected to
              excessive force load, and the test results are often misleading.

The goal of
              this research is focussed on the development of a new testing methodology that
              consists of: (1) an accelerated testing system based on engineering similarity
              laws and (2) a stochastic model and analytical capabilities that can be applied
              to predict the cyclic failure of the HVP.
