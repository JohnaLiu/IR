The Principal Investigators will analyze and interpret time series
              of major ions, insoluble microparticles, and methanesulfonic acid (MSA) from a
              new 300-foot long ice core from the Devon Ice Cap, Devon Island, Canada.  This
              is a collaborative project with the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) and
              Nagaoka Institute of Snow and Ice Studies.  Oxygen isotope analyses,
              direct-current solid electric conductivity (ECM)  and the percentage of annual
              melt layers will be analyzed by scientists at GSC.  The results will be a
              continuous, high-resolution (subannual to decadal) multivariate record of
              Holocene change of the high Arctic.  The results will also complement those
              from the Penny Ice Cap core (Baffin Island).  Snowpit studies that were done
              while coring the first Devon ice core will provide critical information on the
              modern characteristics of both the glaciochemical species and insoluble
              microparticles.  This new core is necessary to validate or refute those
              incongruous findings found in the previously drilled Devon Island ice core with
              other cores drilled around the Canadian High Arctic.

Analyses of all the
              major soluble and insoluble components of the atmosphere as preserved in the
              Devon ice core will enable the Principal Investigators to determine the
              composition of the paleoatmosphere in the eastern Canadian Arctic.  The results
              should provide important information on the timing and cause of climatic change
              during the Holocene and the regionalization of that change.  The results will
              also allow the Principal Investigators to establish a positive relationship
              between sea salt species and recent sea-ice extent to provide important data
              needed to reconstruct relative sea ice extent and the rapidity of changes in
              that extent over the last 10,000 years.  These data may be used to gain a
              better understanding of how human populations were impacted by sea ice extent. 
              This high-resolution core is critical as major episodic events such as volcanic
              eruptions and large biomass burning events, which are evident in ice cores, are
              factored into the analyses.  These findings should contribute to the evaluation
              of spatial variability of anthropogenic emission deposition in the Arctic.  The
              compilation of all the data sets from circum-arctic ice cores will make a major
              contribution in understanding the impact that the Arctic may have on global
              change.
