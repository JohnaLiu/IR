Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop test procedures for synchronous
              sequential  circuits to produce high quality solutions taking into account the
              size and  complexity of modern circuits. Quality is measured by the fault
              coverage, the  defect coverage, and the test sequence length. To handle size
              and complexity,  high quality solutions are being derived using limited run
              time and memory. New  heuristics and techniques for test generation, test
              compaction and  design-for-testability to address this need are being explored.
