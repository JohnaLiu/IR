Abstract    :
              The mass media in contemporary society has an important role in shaping people's
              cultural identity.  This project involves a beginning academic anthropologist
              from Syracuse University, studying the role played by the Latino-oriented
              advertising industry in the creation of generic ethnic labels to encompass
              peoples of diverse Latin American heritage in the US.  The hypothesis to be
              tested is that the advertising industry is contributing to a
              reconceptualization of a common identity which spans race, class and
              nationality for Hispanics.  The research will consist of a twelve month
              ethnographic study of the New York City Latino-oriented advertising industry,
              focusing on producers of advertising imagery and consumers, recipients of such
              messages.  The investigator will  interview participants about the processes
              through which Latino identity is conceived, constructed and disseminated.  The
              research is important because it will advance our understanding of processes of
              commodification and globalization of cultural identity.  By illuminating how
              ethnic differences and similarities are actively marketed in US society, the
              research will provide valuable information for planners and policy makers
              concerned about ethnic relations in a multi-ethnic world.
