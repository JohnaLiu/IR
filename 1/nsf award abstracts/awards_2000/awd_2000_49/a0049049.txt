Abstract    :
              9706699  Kusky    A long standing problem in plate tectonics  relates to how
              mafic-ultramafic complexes  become incorporated into  subduction melanges.
              Several such bodies are particularly well exposed and preserved in the Kenai
              Penninsula, Alaska. The Alaskan bodies are even more intriguing because they
              represent pieces of broken up lower crust. This project will address this issue
              of the origin of ultramafic rocks by the multi-faceted approach of field work,
              structural analysis, geochemistry, and geochronology.  The results will reveal
              to what extent  large scale klippen can be involved in hundreds of km of
              transportation in an overthrusting event that brings such rocks to the surface,
              or whether they were part of the subducting oceanic slab that were caught up in
              the malenge.
