Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with efficient algorithms for combinational
              optimization, both more efficient algorithms for polynomial time solvable
              problems and approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems.  In addition the
              project is concerned with related problems; submodular functions and flows,
              network flows, network design and connectivity and approximate LP solving.
