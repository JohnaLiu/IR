Abstract    :
              OCE-9631759    This project will examine variations in ocean circulation and 
              climate in the subpolar North Atlantic on timescales of 1000-10,000  years
              (suborbital).  Three time slices, each covering a single  glacial/interglacial
              cycle, will be studied, each chosen to  represent climate states under
              different conditions of solar  forcing:  Stage 11/12 (the 100K world during an
              extreme warm  climate) Stage 33/34 (typical 41K world), and the mid-Pliocene 
              (extreme warm pre-glacial world).  Analyses will include planktic  and benthic
              isotopes, SST estimates from planktic forams, and  abundance of ice-rafted
              detritus, all at 250-yr intervals.
