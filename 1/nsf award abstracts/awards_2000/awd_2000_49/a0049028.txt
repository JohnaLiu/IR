Abstract    :
              The use of female circumcision is typically seen in the West as a traditional
              rite of passage that is doomed to disappear with modernization and cultural
              development.  Some studies have shown that the rite has been seen by local
              societies as a form of resistance against colonial authority.  This project
              studies the recent adoption of female circumcision and the integration of this
              ritual into the female initiation ceremonies of a society in Chad. The
              researcher will provide an interpretive account of the recent adoption of the
              rite by situating the event within its historical context; study how female
              circumcision relates to shifts in the meaning of rites of passage and of
              womanhood for the local culture as well as the local society's relationship to
              higher political authority; and document local varieties of support and
              resistance for the practice. The research design includes cases studies in
              three villages with unique histories of exposure to female circumcision.  The
              PI will use participant observation, semi-structured interviews and surveys as
              well as in-depth interviews with initiated women and other key players in the
              initiation ceremonies.  This study will advance our understanding of female
              circumcision in non-Islamic, sub-Saharan populations, and will advance
              theoretical discussions about the role of female circumcision in the larger
              social and cultural setting. It will also add to our knowledge about this
              important region of the world
