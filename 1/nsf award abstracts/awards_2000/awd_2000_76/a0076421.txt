Abstract    :
              This study will examine the circulatory system of the head in extinct
              (dinosaurs) and living (birds and crocodilians) members of the Archosauria. The
              research holds significance beyond basic anatomy in that the inference of
              vascular "devices" will shed light on the behavior and physiology of extinct
              organisms.  For example, warm-blooded vertebrates have countercurrent heat
              exchangers in their cephalic circulatory system, which heat or cool important
              structures in the head such as the brain.  The major objectives of the research
              are (1) to document the anatomy of the head vessels in birds and crocodilians,
              (2) reconstruct vascular structures in extinct archosaurs (e.g., dinosaurs),
              (3) examine the evolution of the vascular system, and (4) formulate hypotheses
              on functional/physiological significance of vascular arrangements.  Data on
              birds and crocodilians will be obtained via gross anatomy, histology, and a
              novel X-ray technique.  Data on dinosaurs will be attained by identifying
              vascular traces in fossils. This project will be the first to compare head
              vasculature in crocodilians, birds, and other vertebrates, and to reconstruct
              vascular structures and patterns in extinct archosaurs.
