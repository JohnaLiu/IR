This is an instrument development award from the
              Instrumentation for Materials Research program to the University of California
              Santa Barbara (UCSB). Investigators at UCSB will develop a scanning microprobe
              short wavelength (3.1 A - 0.31 A, photon energy 4 keV - 40 keV ) x-ray
              microscope capable of multiple imaging modes with 50 nm - 500 nm spatial
              resolution at the Advanced Photon Source (APS).  The microscope will allow
              co-localized determination of elemental distribution and chemical states by
              x-ray fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy.  Using a combination of K and L
              shell fluorescence, it will be possible to map the spatial distribution of all
              elements in the periodic table with detection sensitivity approaching
              parts-per-billion (ppb), surpassing by orders of magnitude the current level
              set by charged-particle microprobes. Spectroscopic micro-imaging will be
              accomplished by spatially resolved X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES)
              measurements, which provide definitive information on the local oxidation
              states of heavy metallo-ions vitally important in many biological (e.g.
              cellular development) and environmental (e.g. contaminated soil remediation)
              studies.  The microscope will be constructed at UCSB and installed at the APS
              accessible by the broader user community through the 25% of total beam time
              allocated to general users.  At a later stage, a second generation microscope
              will be installed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. This
              instrument development provides excellent opportunities for the training of
              graduate and undergraduate students. The project will also contribute to
              enriching of science education for local K-12, and community college.
