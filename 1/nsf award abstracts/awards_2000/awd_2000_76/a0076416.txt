Abstract    :
              
Somatostatins (SS) are a diverse family of peptide hormones that
              control
animal growth, development, and metabolism.  Despite the importance of
              this
hormone family, little is known about the basis of its
              multi-functional
nature.  In particular, it is not known how the hormones and
              their
receptors interact to elicit a specific effect in a particular target
              cell
or how the structural heterogeneity of the SS family influences
              such
interactions.  With this proposed work, the unique situation in
              teleost
fish such as rainbow trout, which possess multiple SSs, will be
              exploited
to examine fundamental aspects of SS-receptor interactions.  The
              hypothesis
that rainbow trout possess multiple SS receptors with differential
              ligand
selectivity that are differentially expressed will be tested in
              four
experimental phases.  In phase I, multiple mRNAs encoding distinct
              SS
receptors will be characterized.  In phase 2, the binding
              characteristics
of expressed SS receptors will be examined.  In phase 3, the
              distribution
and abundance of SS receptor mRNAs will be determined.  In phase
              4, factors
(e.g., nutritional state, insulin) that control the expression of
              SS
receptor mRNAs will be identified.  While this work pertains
              specifically
to fish, it will provide important new insight regarding linkage
              between SS
receptor type to a specific biological action and have broad
              relevance to
understanding the multi-functional nature of SS.
