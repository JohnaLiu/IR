The Mouse Molecular Genetics
              Conference will be held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories August 30-September
              3, 2000. The use of the mouse as a model system for understanding normal
              development has increased rapidly over the last few years. This conference will
              bring together a diverse group of scientists studying various molecular and
              genetic aspects of mammalian development and provide a format for the exchange
              of ideas and information among both junior and senior scientists.
