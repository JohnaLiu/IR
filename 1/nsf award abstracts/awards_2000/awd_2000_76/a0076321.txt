This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
              Massachusetts provides instrumentation to significantly improve the navigation
              capabilities of the manned submersible Alvin, a shared-use vehicle operated by
              WHOI under a memorandum of understanding among NSF, ONR and NOAA.  The
              instrumentation supported here, including a laser doppler instrument and
              attitude sensors (accelerometers), will allow major improvements in "dead
              reckoning" by tracking bottom and correcting for errors caused by near-bottom
              currents.  The improvements in positional accuracy will be of substantial
              advantage to marine scientists using the submersible in their research during
              2001 and future years.
