This IMR grant supports the acquisition of an extensional
              rheometer in the Chemical Engineering department at Clemson University.  The
              instrument will support the research of two young and two midcareer scientists
              in the investigation of extensional viscosity in polymers and polymer blends. 
              The study facilitated by this instrument will allow a more complete
              characterization of a broad class of materials and lead to the development of
              new materials engineered with particular extensional properties. The rheometer
              will also enable current and future students to study extensional properties
              and investigate the influence of these properties on materials processing. 
              Examples of materials to be studied are highly entangled polymer solutions and
              melts, polymer blends, composite materials and suspensions.

Plastics and
              rubbers have extraordinary properites when they are squeezed or stretched. 
              Pulling them apart involves measures such as extensional viscosity which play a
              vital role in the mechanical properties of these materials.  The instrument
              acquisition supported by this grant is to help study the mechanical propertis
              of these technologically critical materials.
