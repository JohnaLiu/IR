Abstract    :
              Bruce Berne of Columbia University is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop an accurate polarizable force field
              for water and aqueous solutions based on the principle of electronegativity
              equalization.  This model will be used to achieve theoretical understanding of
              solvent effects on chemical reactions, solvent dynamics, spectral line shapes,
              and energy transfer in classical and quantum many-body systems through a
              combination of analytical and numerical studies.  The numerical effort will
              involve development of methods in molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and quantum
              Monte Carlo for application to chemical systems.  A special focus of this
              project will be on development and application of analytical and new simulation
              techniques to treat the problem of sampling rough energy landscapes and quantum
              dynamics. 

The development and employment of new computational methodologies
              in this project will lead to insights that impact the understanding of new
              materials development, complex environmental processes, and the thermodynamics
              and conformational states of biological molecules.
