The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide
opportunities for joint research, and
              the use of unique or
complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental
conditions abroad.

This award will provide Dr. Christopher
              Klausmeier with support for 12 months to work 
with Drs. Peter Bossard and
              Elena Litchman at EAWAG/ETH Limnological Research 
Centre in Kastanienbaum,
              Switzerland, Dr. Tadeusz Kawecki at the University of Basel, 
and Dr. Ulf
              Dieckmann at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis 
(IIASA)
              in Vienna, Austria.  The topic of his research is the theoretical approach to
              
understanding the structure of ecological communities.

The goal of this
              project is to develop flexible theoretical techniques which would allow
              
community structure to self-organize from a range of potentially interacting
              species.  
These approaches have been pioneered by Dr. Dieckmann's group at
              IIASA for use in 
evolutionary studies.  With collaborators at EAWAG, Dr.
              Klausmeier will apply these 
techniques to mechanistic models of a particular
              kind of ecological system:  lake 
plankton communities.  He will determine how
              community structure depends on 
environmental parameters such as nutrient
              loading, then test these predictions against 
data from a range of lakes.  He
              expects to develop new general mathematical techniques 
for studying community
              assembly.  By applying them to lake plankton communities, he 
hopes to expand
              understanding of how the structure of these communities depends on
              
environmental parameters and how they will respond to human impacts.
