Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to determine the role of mineral and metal ion
              catalysis in the formation of 3',5'- versus 2',5' -phosphodiester bond
              formation and in the template-directed synthesis  of RNA.  These studies will
              provide insight into the possible role of montmorillonite catalysis in the
              selective prebiotic synthesis of RNA.  The use of catalysts to limit the
              structural diversity of the RNA formed in prebiotic reactions will result in a
              greater population of those structures able to initiate life. These RNAs would
              have the structure capable of both serving as ribozymes and as genetic
              information storage sites in the proposed RNA world.

With this renewal
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research of Dr. James P. Ferris of the Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute.  Professor Ferris will focus his work on exploring the
              role of catalysis in prebiotic synthesis.  The experiments, if successful, will
              provide a major advance in the understanding of life on Earth.  The findings of
              this work will be of great interest to both the scientific community and to the
              general public as well.
