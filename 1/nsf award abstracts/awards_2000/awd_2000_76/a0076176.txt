The importance of RNA sorting, targeted mRNA transport, and
              local protein synthesis has become evident as a result of the convergence of
              information from studies focusing on a variety of molecular, cellular and
              developmental questions.  Through these diverse efforts, it is now clear that
              the targeting of mRNAs to particular intracellular locations plays a key role
              in biological processes that include the establishment of oocyte polarity,
              early embryonic differentiation, somatic cell polarization and function,
              synapse growth, and plasticity in the vertebrate nervous system.  The goal of
              the proposed conference is to bring together researchers with a wide range of
              backgrounds and perspectives who study RNA sorting and localization using a
              variety of experimental approaches.  It is the intent to explore common themes
              and questions including:  (i) The role of RNA localization in the establishment
              of embryonic cell lineages and axial polarity in invertebrates and vertebrates;
              (ii) the nature of the cis-acting signals and trans-acting factors that target
              mRNAs to particular intracellular locations; (iii) the nature of the delivery
              systems that are involved; (iv) the mechanisms that anchor localized mRNAs once
              they research their proper destinations; (v) definition of the nature and
              number of different destinations that reside within individual cell types; (vi)
              the extent to which mRNA translocation and sorting is regulated by
              extracellular and intracellular signaling processes; (vii) the mechanisms
              involved in transport of RNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and in some
              cases from the cytoplasm to the nucleus; and (viii) the multiple ways in which
              RNA sorting plays a role in cellular function such as translational regulation.
