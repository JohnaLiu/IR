Neurogenesis, or the process by which new nerve cells
              are formed, is an
unusual phenomenon in adult vertebrates. The proposed work
              focuses on the
regeneration of the nervous system, particularly on the
              neurogenesis that
occurs after tissue loss or damage. Holothurians or sea
              cucumbers will be
used to study the formation of new nerve cells, or neurons,
              in adult
organisms. First, the work aims to explore the regeneration
              capacities of
the main nervous system and the associated events of cell
              division and
conversion of the dividing cells into neurons. Second, it studies
              the
regeneration of the enteric nervous system, or the component of
              the
nervous system associated with the digestive tract. Finally, it
              studies
genes coding for proteins known to be important in regenerative
              and
embryological processes. Cellular, histological and molecular
              techniques
will be used to achieve these aims. 

Neuron loss is associated
              with mental and motor diseases, learning
impairment, memory loss and many
              other nervous system-related problems.
Echinoderms are well known for their
              amazing regeneration capacities.
Studying regenerative neurogenesis in these
              animals, which are closely
related to vertebrates, will provide basic
              information on the
understanding of how neurons are formed and
              regenerated.
