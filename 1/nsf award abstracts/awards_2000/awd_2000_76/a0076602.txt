Proposal Title: Space Weather Predictions at Big Bear
              Solar Observatory

Principal Investigator: Haimin Wang, NJIT 

The
              investigators will use Big Bear Solar Observatory (California) and the Huairou
              Solar Observatory (China) vector magnetographs to measure shear properties of
              the photospheric magnetic field. The main effort is to derive the shear
              properties from data acquired, and to make the information widely available on
              a web site for use as a flare predictor. The investigators will also implement
              a 24-hour high-resolution and high-cadence network (California, China, Austria)
              to observe the Sun in the spectral line H-alpha, developing automatic
              monitoring for flux emergence and on-disk filament eruptions. These results
              will also be made available on a web site for use in space weather forecasting.
              This network will also be used to improve the classic "Bear Alerts" and make
              them more complete. Any of the three stations will be able to initiate an alert
              - yielding a duty cycle over 80%. The investigation will include a statistical
              study of the relation between filament eruptions and observed geomagnetic
              storms, and comparison of observations with a specific (Chen CME) model.
