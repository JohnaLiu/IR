Abstract    :
              This award will provide partial support for the 2000 Complex Fluids Gordon
              Conference to be held at Salve Regina College in Newport, RI. The conference
              will deal with structures in which external forces exert stress on a soft
              interface to create new structures. For example, sickle cells are red blood
              cells distorted by abnormal aggregation of proteins within the cells which in
              turn exert distorting forces on the cell membrane. The conference will address
              the ongoing need for cross-fertilization amongst soft matter physicists,
              biophysicists, chemists and chemical engineers. International participation
              will be encouraged. Particular efforts are being made to engage the mechanical
              engineering community in the discussion of force transduction in complex media.
              The award will provide specific support for junior participants, both domestic
              and foreign.
