This award provides support for the travel and conference
              registration fees of students and young investigators as participants in the
              conference Signal Transduction by Engineered Extracellular Matrices, Tilton,
              New Hampshire, June 25-29, 2000. 
  
This Gordon Conference discussed the
              converging roles of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and soluble factors for the
              repair or replacement of tissue lost or damaged due to disease or injury. 
              Emphasis was placed on discussion of the state-of-the-art, unpublished research
              in signal transduction, the mechanisms by which growth factors and the ECM
              regulate cell fate, and their application to tissue engineering. Two roundtable
              discussions facilitated close interaction between researchers working in the
              fields of cytokine signal transduction, ECM, and tissue engineering. A workshop
              on career and research funding opportunities in these areas also was held. The
              meeting provided a platform for the development of long term interdisciplinary 
               interactions, and exposed students and young professionals to the latest ideas
              and opportunities at the confluence of signal transduction, molecular and
              cellular biology, and tissue engineering.
