The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Brian C. Moore with support for
              twenty-four months to work with Professor Angel Linares-Solano at the
              University of Alicante in Alicante, Spain on the preparation of a novel
              activated carbon fiber tailored for low pressure methane storage.
The
              objective of this research is to tailor-make activated carbon fibers (ACFs) for
              low-pressure storage of methane.  The PIs hypothesize that the size of the
              pores within the ACFs will play a crucial role in determining methane capacity.
               When natural gas is adsorbed into a pore it has a much higher density than it
              does as
 a gas.  The tendency of natural gas to adsorb in a pore is a function
              of pore width.  ACFs with different pore sizes will be produced and their
              respective methane storage will be measured. The goal is to determine what pore
              sizes correlate with the most methane storage.  Favorable results could allow
              natural gas to emerge as a highly competitive vehicle fuel.  Natural gas is
              usually stored under high pressure in heavy, expensive tanks. 
This study
              could produce an ACF capable of competitively adsorbing natural gas at
              pressures that are considerably lower than those of compressed natural
              gas.
Dr. Linares-Solano and his colleagues at Alicante have been conducting
              activated carbon studies for two decades, giving them considerable expertise in
              this area of research.
