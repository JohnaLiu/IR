Resonance Raman, X-ray crystallographic, and
              computational methods will be used to study three heme proteins, myoglobin
              (Mb), cytochrome c (cyt c), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), in organic media.
                Studies of these systems will be directed toward four specific objectives: 
              1) elucidating the role of bound distal pocket water and the internal H-bond
              network in the redox mechanism of cytochrome c and myoglobin; 2) identifying
              perturbations of the active site structure and function of lyophilized enzyme
              HRP powders and cross-linked enzyme crystals of HRP in nonaqueous media; 3)
              determining the mechanism whereby small-molecule excipients such as
              poly(ethylene glycol) and KCl enhance the catalytic activity of lyophilized
              enzyme powders in nonaqueous media; and 4) elucidating the heme active site
              structural changes in HRP in benzene that result in the change in catalytic
              mechanism for HRP in benzene (from oxidative electron transfer to oxo
              transfer). The research will be divided into three focus areas: 1) resonance
              Raman structural studies of horseradish peroxidase enzyme powders and
              cross-linked enzyme crystals in nonaqueous media;  2) x-ray crystallographic
              study of bound water in cyt c and Mb and the E-S complex of HRP in benzene; and
              3) computational study of heme proteins in nonaqueous media. 

This research
              will  provide insight at the molecular level into the phenomenon of
              biomolecular recognition in heme proteins and enzymes and the mechanism of
              nonaqueous enzymology, a powerful new method of organic synthesis in which
              enzymes are used as biocatalysts in solvents other than water.  Such knowledge
              will deepen fundamental understanding of the function of these proteins in
              nature and expand the utility of proteins and enzymes in biotechnology and
              biocatalysis.
