The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers 
to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards 
provide opportunities for joint research, and
              the use of unique or complementary 
facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will provide Dr. Darren E. Irwin with support
              for twenty-four months to work 
with Dr. Staffan Bensch at Lund University in
              Sweden.


The splitting of a single species into two, or speciation, takes a
              long time to occur and is 
thus difficult to observe directly.  A rare
              opportunity to study speciation  is provided by a 
ring species, in which a
              long chain or interbreeding populations encircle a geographic 
barrier; the
              terminal populations in the chain do not interbreed where they come together. 
              
For two ring species - the Willow Warbler encircling the Baltic Sea and the
              Greenish 
Warbler encircling central Asia - the principal investigator will
              use geographical 
variation around the ring to reconstruct how two species
              evolved from one.  He will work 
with Dr. Bensch at Lund to focus on four
              questions:  1) In the contact zone between two 
forms of the Willow Warbler in
              central Sweden, are there differences in songs between 
the forms and are the
              differences used in mate choice? 2) How do migration patterns vary 
around the
              Greenish Warbler ring? 3) Is there gradual variation in Willow Warbler
              
populations around the Baltic, thereby connecting forms in southern and
              northern 
Sweden?  4) What is the migratory behavior of hybrids in central
              Sweden?  The answers 
will clarify the role of behavioral traits and selection
              against hybrids in speciation.

Dr. Bensch uses novel techniques to study
              migration and to measure genetic differences 
between populations.  Lund
              University has excellent facilities for studying both migration 
and genetic
              variation.
