Good room temperature toughness has been reported based
              on limited, qualitative tests on ruthenium aluminide, RuAl.  This is unusual
              for intermetallic alloys that have the CsCl (B2) type crystal structure.
              Previous experiments suggest that this unusual toughness originates from the
              multiplicity of slip along the <110> and <100> directions which differs
              considerably from that of most other B2 compounds in which the common slip
              directions are either <111> or <100>. Reasons, however, for this unusual
              deformation behavior have not yet been identified, probably due to the
              difficulty in processing single crystals and the exotic nature of the alloy.
              This research effort directly measures the deformation behavior and fracture
              toughness of RuAl using single crystals and multiphase composite
              microstructures of controlled orientations. Preliminary work has shown that
              appropriate materials for testing can be produced by cold crucible Czochralski
              techniques. The primary goal for the research is to explain the deformation
              behavior of RuAl and to correlate the similarities and differences with that of
              other B2 compounds. With this knowledge, the underlying mechanisms for
              deformation and fracture can be identified and modeled which will lead to
              design strategies for improving the toughness of semi-brittle materials. 
              
%%%
Intermetallics are often considered candidate materials for high
              temperature structural applications due to the high melting temperature and
              good oxidation resistance of many intermetallic compounds. However, problems
              with brittleness have not been solved for intermetallic alloy systems that are
              to operate above the use temperature of the superalloys.
