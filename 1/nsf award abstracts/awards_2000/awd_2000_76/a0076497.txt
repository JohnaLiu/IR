This award to the University of Memphis provides support for
              the acquisition of a scanning nanoindentation testing system for the
              characterization of bone materials at the nanoindentation scale. A scanning
              nanoindenter, which combines the load-displacement transducer of a nanoindenter
              with the image scanning capabilities of an atomic force microscope, will be
              used to determine the mechanical properties and image surface microstructure
              and topography of bone materials. It will constitute a major advance in our
              ability to understand bone tissue mechanics on a scale much closer to the
              cellular level. Knowledge of such mechanical properties and structural
              characteristics are a key step towards predicting the behavior of whole bone
              and determining the extent to which aging and disease processes alter the
              strength of bone. This new instrument will enhance the research infrastructure
              of the University of Memphis and will also serve as a focal point for the
              introduction of state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation into several
              engineering courses.
