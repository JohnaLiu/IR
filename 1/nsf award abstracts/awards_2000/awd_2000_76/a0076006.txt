Abstract    :
              
Recently there has been a growing body of evidence indicating ATP plays a
              significant role as an extracellular messenger in a number of biological
              processes, including cell volume regulation. Extracellular ATP exerts its
              influence by acting as an autocrine/paracrine signal, binding to specific cell
              surface receptors known as purinoceptors. Purinoceptors have been subdivided
              into two main categories: P1 receptors that recognize nucleosides, such as
              adenosine, and P2 receptors that bind ATP and other nucleotides. The P2
              receptors have been further subdivided into two main subtypes: P2X
              (ligand-gated ion channels) and P2Y (receptors coupled to a G-protein). Initial
              studies have shown that RVD in Necturus red blood cells (RBCs) depends on K+
              efflux through an ion channel that is activated during cell swelling by
              extracellular ATP (Light et al., Am. J. Physiol., 277 (Cell Physiol. 46):
              C480-C491, 1999). The objective of this project is to identify the purinoceptor
              used by Necturus RBCs to regulate cell volume in hypotonic solutions
