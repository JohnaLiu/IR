This
              project continues research on extremal surfaces and related
geometric
              variational problems, with applications to
low-dimensional topology and the
              natural sciences.  The principal
investigator will work on (1) existence and
              uniqueness of
surfaces minimizing the Willmore bending energy,
              (2)
determination of the moduli spaces of complete constant mean
curvature
              surfaces (CMC) with finite topology, (3) geometric
analysis of brownian motion
              and potential theory on properly
embedded minimal surfaces with infinite
              topology, and (4) the
existence and geometry of energy-minimizing knots and
              links.  In
addition, the principal investigator will work at GANG with
senior
              scientist N. Schmitt on the approach to constructing CMC
surfaces using
              monodromy of flat (loop) SU(2)-bundles over a
Riemann surface; this will
              include an experimental aspect
(computation and visualization of families of
              examples), as well
as a theoretical aspect (relationship between integrable
              systems
and the functional/ geometric analysis methods).

While the
              motivation for most of this work is primarily
aesthetic, it should be noted
              that minimal, CMC and Willmore
surfaces arise in physical situations as
              interfaces between
fluids, and thus their geometry may have some value in
              predicting
the behaviors of certain natural and synthetic materials. 
              For
example, vast resources are wasted when automatic soldering of
electronic
              microcomponents results in short- or open-circuits:
some of the principal
              investigator's work on CMC surfaces has
direct application to this problem; he
              has freely shared his
ideas (at NIST and elsewhere) with people trying to
              solve it.
The principal investigator's recent work on ropelength of knots
and
              links (some published in the general science journal, Nature)
represents the
              first careful effort to mathematically investigate
-- and, in certain
              instances, correct -- claims in the literature
about the geometry of long
              polymeric chains (such as DNA); he is
actively collaborating with natural
              scientists around the world
on this topic.  Schmitt's visualization work on
              new CMC surfaces
has been documented in the recent GANG film "Surfaces, Flows
              &
Holonomy," scenes of which are available at www.gang.umass.edu.
