	The study of organismal phylogeny provides a basis for
              taxonomic classification and also a way to measure the earth's tremendous
              biological diversity. This project by Prof. Rytas Vilgalys at Duke University
              and colleagues Dr. Jean-Marc Moncalvo and Dr. James Johnson at Cameron
              University focuses on phylogenetic systematics of gilled and fleshy mushrooms,
              in the order Agaricales, and the analysis of biological diversity in this group
              based on molecular phylogenetic trees. Mushrooms and related fungi are
              estimated to include over 10,000 species and they are often essential
              components of terrestrial ecosystems, playing important roles as primary
              decomposers of organic matter, as mutualistic symbionts of plants, but also as
              agents of plant and animal disease. The unique biochemical pathways of fungi
              also represent a largely untapped source of novel metabolites and potential
              drugs. The project extends current research to incorporate additional sequenced
              genes from both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, as evidence to infer
              phylogenetic relatedness among fungal taxa and to reclassify these fungi into
              an estimated 25-35 families. This molecular phylogenetic framework in turn
              permits evaluation of morphological features associated with reduced and
              enclosed ("puffballs") forms of agaric fungi and also the mycorrhizal habit, to
              understand the apparently multiple and independent cases of convergent
              evolution in spore-producing and root-infecting structures. The project will
              develop a comprehensive DNA sequence database for quick identification and
              accurate classification of agaric fungi. The study will also develop a
              theoretical framework for measuring biodiversity based on DNA evidence, which
              may prove useful for comparative studies and for making conservation decisions
              based on measures of genetic diversity within geographic areas.
