The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Andrew J. Crawford with
              twenty-four months of support to work with Dr. Federico V. Bolanos at the
              Universidad de Costa Rica and Dr. Eldredge Bermingham at the Smithsonian
              Tropical Research Institute in Panama.
This project involves conservation
              genetics of tropical frogs, important in understanding this decade's global
              decline in frog populations and species.  The goal of this research is to
              estimate the spatial scale and temporal rate at which the processes of genetic
              erosion and faunal collapse affect fragmented populations of Neotropical frogs.
              It will answer the following questions: 1) How far may habitat fragments be
              reduced and isolated before the following are affected: a) frog abundance, b)
              frog diversity, c) phenotypic variation, and d) genetic variation within
              populations? 2) How quickly do the above variables decline over time?  The PIs
              will use DNA "fingerprinting" and DNA sequencing to resolve evolutionary
              histories of populations.  This will provide an analysis of the long-term
              survival prospects of a tropical frog fauna.
Dr. Bolanos is an authority on
              the current status of amphibians in Costa Rica and has been monitoring
              populations for over a decade.  Dr. Bermingham is a specialist in genetic
              studies of tropical vertebrates.
