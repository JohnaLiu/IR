Abstract    :
              This project represents a major effort to apply global technologies to the
              analyses of specific acclimation processes in cyanobacteria.  It would make it
              possible to identify genes that are controlled under a number of different 
              environmental conditions and elucidate networks of control that link the
              responses of the cell to diverse environmental signals.   Specifically
              microarray analyses is being used to identify genes that become active during
              acclimation of Synechocystis PCC6803 to high light and nitrogen limitation. A
              whole genome chip is available. These analyses will provide clues concerning
              light and possibly redox control of metabolic processes. It may also be
              possible to identify the regulatory elements associated with high light and
              nutrient limitation responses since the transcription of regulatory genes in
              prokaryotes is often controlled by the environmental condition to which the
              regulator is sensitive. Microarray technology will be used to analyze one
              regulatory mutant, dspA, that has been shown to be altered in control of many
              high light regulated genes in Synechocystis PCC6803; the DspA protein appears
              to be involved in acclimation of the cells to high light. The information
              generated in this initial study will be used to exploit microarrays to dissect
              global regulation in cyanobacteria.
