This is a RUI grant to support theoretical research on systems
              far from equilibrium.  The selection of states in non-equilibrium systems is
              poorly understood despite the vast array of such phenomena occurring in
              everyday life and technologically important processes.  Examples include
              everything from coffee stains on a napkin and frost on a window pane to vortex
              flow patterns in superconductors and cellular interfaces in directional
              ordering, solidification and viscous fingering experiments.  While it is
              unlikely that a single variational method can be developed to encompass all
              such phenomena (as the Boltzmann principle does in equlibrium) it may be
              possible to develop methods for specific classes of phenomena or behavior.  The
              goals of this research are to characterize state selection in a number of
              important physical systems and to develop a variational principle for a
              relatively simple class of non-equilibrium systems.
