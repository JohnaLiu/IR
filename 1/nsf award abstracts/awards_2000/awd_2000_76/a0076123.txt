Abstract    :
              The advent of the Internet will have a profound impact on the way commerce is
              transacted.  Since the rise of Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP), all eyes
              are now on how this paradigm will be transferred to the Web. Unfortunately,
              there are significant problems with ERP that must be addressed before it can
              realize the full potential of the Internet.  Within ERP is the older model,
              Manufacturing Resources Planning  (MRP II) that was built upon a simple model
              known as Material Requirements Planning (MRP).  MRP, being developed more than
              30 years ago, made several simplifying assumptions in order to make the
              computations feasible.  One of these was that lead times are an attribute of
              the part in question, not the condition of the facility.  This assumption leads
              to inflated planned lead times which, in turn, leads to long flow times.  This
              artifact has been perpetuated to the present day and lies at the heart of the
              materials management module of the most popular and comprehensive ERP systems
              today.

The conference will address these and other issues involving ERP,
              including:  (1) Integrating material and capacity planning.  (2) Effect of
              supply chain structures.  (3) Integrating web based ERP with central data
              warehouses.  (4) Cross-functional integration with marketing and finance.  (5)
              Scalability issues.   (6) Lead-time and inventory reduction.  (7) New issues
              such as remanufacturing and process industry ERP.
