Abstract    :
              Gan is operating a national high-energy physics conference that the Division of
              Particle Physics holds once every two years.  The cost of operating this
              Conference is shared between DoE and NSF.  The proposal seeks support for
              graduate students and post docs who would otherwise cannot afford to attend.
