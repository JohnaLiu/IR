Abstract    :
              This project explores new strategies and methods for the total synthesis of a
              variety of structural types of natural products.  The emphasis of the project
              is on cycloaddition chemistry, and the focus is placed upon those that can be
              rendered asymmetric.  In this way, polycyclic products will be produced as
              single enantiomers.  The targets selected for synthesis are taken from the
              broad palette of naturally occurring structures that includes terpene,
              alkaloids, and other complex systems containing both carbocyclic and
              heterocyclic frameworks.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program (Organic Synthesis) supports the research of Professor James
              D. White of Oregon State University.  Professor White is involved in the total
              synthesis of natural products, wherein specific molecules that have been
              isolated from some natural source are replicated in exact detail through a
              series of chemical reactions.  The strategies and tactics that one employs in
              this endeavor determine the efficiency with which these molecules are prepared
              in a laboratory setting, and this often will determine whether or not a
              particular substance can be mass-produced for pharmaceutical or other use.
