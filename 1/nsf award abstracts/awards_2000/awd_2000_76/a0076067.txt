This project will investigate institutional centers of
              scholarly, religious and social life in India, the matha. These caste-based,
              community oriented institutions work to bind together and empower the members
              of their caste to achieve various political and economic rights promised by the
              state. In Karnataka, the largest and most powerful matha-s are affiliated with
              the three dominant castes, the Brahmans, Lingayats, and Vokkaligas. These
              matha-s have become politically powerful and also oversee the social welfare of
              their constituents (schools, hospitals, etc.).  The researcher hypothesizes
              that the matha-s are reconfiguring hierarchical Hindu society around the matha
              (trans-regional, caste based) institution itself, and that this is a response
              to urbanization and the expanding market economy. The project will center on
              the activities, authority, and mobilization efforts of one matha from each of
              the three dominant caste groups. Methods include participant observation,
              structured interviews, and audio-visual documentation. The project will
              contribute to our understanding of the role of these Hindu institutions in
              constructing contemporary Indian social structure and the modern Indian
              State.
