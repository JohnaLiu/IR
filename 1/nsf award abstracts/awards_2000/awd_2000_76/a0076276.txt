This award to the University of Washington is for the
              development of high fields solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR)
              console for biomaterials research and student training. A common challenge in
              the molecular bioengineering field is the characterization of biomolecules at
              material surfaces. SSNMR has the potential to fill a particularly crucial gap
              in our knowledge by defining the secondary structure of proteins adsorbed onto
              material surfaces, determining protein dynamics at surfaces, and by providing
              high-resolution structural maps of protein-surface interactions. This award
              will allow the University of Washington to upgrade a 500 megahertz, 15 years
              old solid state NMR console. The new console will dramatically expand the
              biomaterials program at the university by enabling scientsists to perform NMR
              studies of biomaterials at high magnetic fields and at reduced temperatures.
              The NMR console will also be equipped with a refrigeration system for cooling
              samples to temperatures as low as 200K. The console will also be capable of
              performing SSNNM experiments at Larmor frequencies as high as 1,000 MHz.
