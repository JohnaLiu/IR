This is an award to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for the
              acquisition of a digital imaging system for Transmission electron microscopy
              (TEM). The instrument will be fitted on an existing JEOL 2010 TEM to develop
              two new techniques, super-resolution TEM, (SRTEM) and selected reflection
              imaging (SRI). This will make it possible to develop a simple but an effective
              model to extend the resolution of TEM micrograph through post image processing.
              The first method only involves Fourier transform and image summation. With this
              method, images with 0.15 nanometer resolution are routinely obtained with this
              method. The second technique consists in selected reflection imaging for
              nanostructured materials characterization.  This technique uses a single ring
              in the electron diffraction pattern to form the image.  A small aperture and
              illumination tilting are used to achieve the experimental set-up in a
              conventional TEM.  Preliminary results obtained using conventional JEOL 2010
              TEM indicate that this technique has the advantage of easy operation, and
              instant results.  Measurement of nano-particle size, phase identification and
              volume fraction measurement in dual phase materials will be possible.

This
              grant is to support acquisition of a digital imaging system,  a sophisticated
              system which will be a tremendous improvement in terms of resolution, as well
              as ability to record the images and later analyze them, over the current
              facilities.  The instrument is best suited for research at the small
              nanotechnology scale.
