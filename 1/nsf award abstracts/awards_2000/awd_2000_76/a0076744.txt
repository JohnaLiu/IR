This project will investigate health and nutritional status
              in three hurricane-affected areas of Honduras. It will focus on how those
              involved in reconstruction after a major disaster cope with sickness and
              healing, examining variation between several sites. It is hypothesized that
              health and nutritional status will be worse in large urban resettlement areas
              than in affected zones of a small, regional city ("urban disadvantage"); it is
              anticipated that this will persist despite greater investment in the larger
              zone in reconstruction resources. It is also hypothesized that local and
              household food security directly shape overall health and nutritional status.
              Relationships between health status and household income, demographic factors,
              educational levels, and hygiene will also be tested. Methods include
              participant observation, household surveys, and the collection of
              anthropometric and epidemiological data from sample households.  The project
              will contribute to our understanding of the various forces that shape disaster
              recovery and public health after disasters.
