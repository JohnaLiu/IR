Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Northwestern
              University supports an interdisciplinary research program on materials with an
              emphasis on the nanoscale.  The theme of the MRSEC is "Advancing Materials
              Research and Education to Improve the Quality of Life".  Research is carried
              out in four interdisciplinary research groups, with appropriate seed projects. 
              Within IRG 1 the Center focuses on nanostructured materials for chemical and
              biological sensing with the aim to develop and characterize new materials for
              use in making chemical and biological sensors for environmental applications.
              Within IRG 2 complex oxides are investigated to use materials design and
              synthesis in order to develop new thin film ceramic materials required for
              advanced photonic applications.  The work in IRG 3 uses and interdisciplinary
              approach to develop a scientific basis for the synthesis and processing of new
              types of environmentally benign polymers.  Finally, IRG 4, which is concerned
              with the architecture, transport, and binding in molecular crystals,
              polyelectrolyte nanocomposites, and nanoscale structures, is focused on new
              materials and the design of new molecular assemblies with ultimate potential
              applications to batteries, fuel cells, and molecular electronics.  The Center
              features a strong pre-college educational program,  including the widely
              disseminated Materials World Modules (MWM), as well as outstanding
              undergraduate and graduate educational opportunities.  Of particular interest
              is the Master's Materials Technology Program which prepares graduates to teach
              materals science concepts at the community college level.

Participants in
              the 4 IRG Center include 33 senior investigators, 6 postdoctoral associates, 17
              graduate students, 15 undergraduates, and 6 technicians and other support
              personnel.  Professor R.P.H. Chang directs the MRSEC.
