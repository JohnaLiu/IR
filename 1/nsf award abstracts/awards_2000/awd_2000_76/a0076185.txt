The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Allan T. Gulledge with support
              for 24 months to work with Dr. Greg Stuart at the John Curtain School of
              Medical Research at Australian National University in Canberra,
              Australia.
Pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex receive information from
              other cortical areas on distal dendrites. This project will investigate whether
              dendritic conductances amplify these inputs.  To study how distal synaptic
              inputs are integrated within individual dendritic trees in the mammalian
              cortex, three hypotheses will be tested.  1) Layer I synaptic input is
              sufficient to induce Na+ and/or Ca+ spikes in the apical tufts of these
              neurons; 2) Layer I excitatory inputs modulate the pattern of action potential
              generation in these neurons by interacting with back propagating somatically
              evoked action potentials; and 3) Dopamine, a prominent neuromodulator in the
              prefrontal cortex inhibits the propagation of layer I excitory postsynaptic
              potentials toward the soma of these layer V cells.
The host, Dr. Stuart has
              extensive experience in the field of synaptic integration in cortical neurons. 
              He pioneered techniques for recording from dendritic processes of neurons in
              brain slices.
