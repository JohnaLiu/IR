Abstract    :
              
	Researchers examining evolutionary divergence in locomotion
              characteristically rely upon a model of initial behavioral modification
              followed by secondary morphological change.  Yet, studies of gliding
              performance in frogs suggest that concomitant changes in morphology and
              behavior may be required, making the behavioral precedence model untenable. 
              Arboreal squirrels provide a perfect system to test the model since a
              transition from leaping to gliding likely occurred in this group.  The
              objective of the proposed study is to determine whether the sequence of
              evolutionary changes from leaping to gliding is consistent with the behavioral
              precedence model.  The study examines variation in three arboreal squirrels
              (flying squirrel, tree squirrel, chipmunk) and a close arboreal relative
              (dormouse) at the following levels: 1) Morphology; 2) Biomechanics; 3)
              Locomotor behavior; and 4) Ecology.  The synthesis phase employs multivariate
              statistics to summarize variation in these levels and to identify significant
              trait differences among species.  Traits are subsequently mapped onto the
              phylogeny to test behavioral precedence.  
In addition to testing the model,
              the study provides the first comparative examination of mammalian arboreal
              leaping outside of primates, and the only detailed description of mammalian
              gliding.  Biomechanical descriptions of leaping and gliding locomotion may have
              important implications for those intending to use animals as model systems in
              engineering design.
