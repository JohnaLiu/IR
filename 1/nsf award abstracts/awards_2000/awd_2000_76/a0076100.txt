Abstract    :
              This study will examine the role of red imported fire ants in reducing the
              reproductive performance, and thereby in affecting the social and mating
              system, of eastern bluebirds. Previous work has shown that the reproduction of
              bluebirds in Athens, Georgia, where the ants are established, is depressed
              compared to the reproduction of the same species in Clemson, South Carolina,
              where the ants have been absent.  Now the ants are invading Clemson; this
              natural experiment will be used to test the hypothesis that the fire ants are
              the cause of decreased reproduction.  Bluebird reproduction and social behavior
              will be monitored in the two sites.  The Athens site will serve as a control
              for other kinds of environmental variation.  If fire ants are the cause of
              lowered reproduction in Athens, then as they invade Clemson, bluebird
              reproduction should decline there, as well.

A new species invasion is like a
              stone thrown into a pond.  How far do the ripples go, and how many distant
              relationships do they affect?  This study will contribute to the general answer
              to this big question.  It may be that the tendency of a male bird to guard his
              mate, and the rate at which his mate engages in extra-pair matings, is
              influenced by an invading ant species.
