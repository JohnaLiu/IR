Abstract    :
              Partial support is provided for the second Gordon Research Conference on Thin
              Film Mechanical Behavior.  The meeting will explore research frontiers in
              deformation and failure of thin films, their adhesion and delamination, the
              stress evolution during film growth, and issues in modeling and
              characterization of these films.  The target audience includes highly qualified
              and currently active researchers as well as graduate students and post doctoral
              researchers from diverse groups.
