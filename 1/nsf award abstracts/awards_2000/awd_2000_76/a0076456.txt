This is an award for the acquisition of a
              scanning X-ray microbeam system. The system will be equipped with a X-Y
              scanning stage, a temperature controller, and an electromagnet.  The system
              will be added on to an existing Rigaku RTP360RC with a 12 kW X-ray source. This
              attachment will focus the X-ray beam down to a 10 x 10 micron square spot and
              will allow spatially dependent diffractometry with localized high flux of X-ray
              for characterizing combinatorial libraries and composition-spread samples, as
              well as confined samples of organic and inorganic macromolecules. Work
              performed with the instrumentation requested will complement and expand already
              existing efforts in the study of composition-spread samples, nanometer
              structured materials and spatially confined materials at the University of
              Maryland College Park. The instrument will provide new and much needed
              capability at the institution. It enables one to obtain spatially dependent
              structural information and distribution of various materials phases within
              individual samples. It is particularly instrumental in investigating formation
              of various compositional phases at different sites on combinatorial libraries
              and mapping the structural changes and phase distribution across
              composition-spread samples. Students with diverse background and origin will
              benefit from research program based on this equipment.
