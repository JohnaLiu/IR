This is a proposal for a planning visit to Lake Tai, China
              by Dr. Wayne Gardner, the University of Texas, to discuss a cooperative
              research project with Mr. Yang Longyuan, the Nanjing Institute of Geography and
              Limnology. This visit involves planning a  research project between the
              University of Texas Marine Science Institute and the Nanjing Institute of
              Geography and Limnology and visiting the research sites.  The goal is to
              develop a proposal to study nitrogen fluxes, transportation and sinks in
              Meilang Bay, Lake Tai and to compare the results to those obtained in Texas
              coastal waters.  The Chinese Academy of Science and the NSF will jointly
              sponsor this visit.
