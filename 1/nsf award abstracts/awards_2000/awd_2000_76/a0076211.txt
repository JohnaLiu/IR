The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Dror Seliktar with support for
              24 months to work with Professor Jeffrey A. Hubbell at the Swiss Federal
              Institute of Technology (ETH) and the University of Zurich in
              Switzerland.
This project will focus on the development and in vitro testing
              of specialized synthetic hydrogels that are used to regulate the injury
              response after balloon angioplasty. Hydrogel biomaterials will be developed
              with functional components (polypeptides) designed to promote both endothelial
              cell adhesion and endothelial cell-mediated enzyme (MMP-2) activation, while
              exhibiting susceptibility to the activated MMP-2 enzyme.  Testing the
              functional characteristics will be done in vitro using a set of carefully
              designed cell culture experiments.
The host, Professor Hubbell has a large,
              active group at one of the strongest research centers in the world in this area
              of research.
