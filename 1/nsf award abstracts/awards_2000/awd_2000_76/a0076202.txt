The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Alicia S.
              Schultheis with support for twelve months to work with Dr. Jane Hughes at
              Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia.
This one-year study will use
              molecular techniques developed by Dr. Schultheis to determine how adult
              dispersal and differences in life history affect the genetic structuring of
              Australian stream insect populations. They will address whether 1) adult flight
              operates as an effective large-scale dispersal mechanism across areas of
              fragmented adult (terrestrial) habitat?, and 2) are fine-scale patterns of
              genetic differences among larval populations of stream insects the result of
              limited in-stream movement and patchy oviposition?  Besides leading to a better
              understanding of the effects of genetic structuring, it will also provide
              valuable information about whether fragmentation of the surrounding forest
              affects stream insect populations by disrupting adult dispersal.  The study
              will provide a framework in which to begin studying similar processes in
              streams throughout the world, including temperate streams of North
              America.
Dr. Hughes and her colleagues have generated a unique set of data
              regarding dispersal and genetic structure of stream insects that is not
              available elsewhere.  Their data provide the only system in which effects of
              life history of these insects can be studied.
