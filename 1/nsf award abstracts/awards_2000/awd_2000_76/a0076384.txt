Abstract    :
              Howard Reiss of UCLA is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
              Program to investigate molecular theories of nucleation using statistical
              mechanics methods.  This research is divided into four projects:  maintenance
              of rigor and consistency in molecular theories of nucleation; development of a
              theory for the kinetics of nucleation; formulation of the thermodynamics of
              solid interfaces with application to the dependence of deliquescence pressure
              on particle size; and development of a theory for heterogeneous nucleation, in
              connection with systems of atmospheric interest such as the formation of
              sulfate aerosols.

Nucleation is one of the most ubiquitous phenomena in all
              of science and technology.  Despite its importance, the theory of nucleation
              has until recently been phenomenological.   The formulation of a coherent,
              consistent theory of molecular nucleation has important consequences for many
              practical applications in atmospheric science, crystallization, metallurgy, and
              nanophase chemistry.
