Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of low temperature methasis routes to new
              and novel metastable superlattices containing alternating layers such as metal
              sulfide/metal oxide, metal nitride/metal oxide or metal oxide/metal oxide
              composites.  The primary goal is to develop a generic rational synthetic
              strategy for preparing composite superlattice materials with interesting
              phenomena that include metallic/magnetic superlattices as magnetic memory or
              magnetoresistive materials, dielectric/superconducting superlattices exhibiting
              interlayer tunneling behavior and proximity effects, and
              ferrimagnetic/superconducting superlattices.  Strategies to be developed
              include:  1) Metal Oxide/Metal Chacogenide Superlattices through Soft
              Chemistry, and 2) Metathesis Chemistry with Layered Nitride Halide Compounds. 
              Collaborations with the Center for Suerconductivity Research at the University
              of Maryland will provide a wealth of new structure-property correlations that
              will be of interest to the solid state/condensed matter community as a
              whole.
%%%
This project involves the development of new materials synthesis
              and processing tools to optimize the search for high performance materials such
              as electronic and magnetic materials.  Due to the strong collaborations that
              have been arranged with the Center for Superconductivity Research at the
              University of Maryland, the education component of this project is particularly
              strong in that it will provide excellent training for undergraduate, graduate,
              and postdoctoral fellows interested in working in industry.
