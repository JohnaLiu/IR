Abstract    :
              	The Twenty-Second Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at Northwestern
              University from October 20-21, 2000. This colloquium series has become an
              important regional meeting. It attracts participants primarily from the greater
              Midwest probability community. It has a strong tradition of encouraging
              graduate students and other young investigators to attend and interact with
              specialists.
