This award from the instrumentation for materials research
              program in DMR will allow Leghigh University to acquire a multipurpose
              high-power fiber optic system, which can be operated in the CW or pulsed mode
              and capable of producing picosecond or femtosecond pulses. The system will
              significantly enhance present research capabilities and broaden the impact of 
              a recently acquired GOALI research grant. The Lehigh facility will be expanded
              and developed to op a full-scale, state-of-the-art Fiber Optics Laboratory.
              This laboratory will serve: (1) to uncover the relationship between the glass
              microscopics and optical nonlinearities and provide a the necessary link
              between fundamental glass research and fiber optics; (2) to train PhD level
              graduate students in photonics (these are in very short supply at the present)
              who understand optics as well as materials; (3) as a link between the
              university and industry; (4) as a pole for experimental studies in materials
              for integrated optics and optical communications at Lehigh.
