Abstract    :
              This research will contribute to learning how a novel allatostatin (AST) peptide
              affects heart rate.  Studies will be conducted to determine which part of the
              peptide is required for its effect, how the peptide interacts with other
              molecules to cause its activity, and where and when the peptide is present in
              the brain and gut in order to understand how AST acts.
	Environmental and
              physiological factors influence the brain to release peptide hormones that
              affect activities essential to the development and well being of an animal. 
              The role of peptide hormones as messengers and modulators of critical functions
              makes it important to delineate the mechanisms by which they act. 
              Understanding how a peptide acts and where it exists in an animal provides
              important basic science that can lead to applied science applications.
