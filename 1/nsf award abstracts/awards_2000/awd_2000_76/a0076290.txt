Abstract    :
              This project, sponsored by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
              continues research to develop a better understanding of solvation in condensed
              phases. Conducted by Drs.Sarah C. Rutan, Sally S. Hunnicutt and Donald D.
              Shillady and  students from Dr. Rutan's research  group at Virginia
              Commonwealth University, the research uses  chemometric methods in conjunction
              with electronic and vibrational spectroscopies to study mixed solvents,
              solvated surfaces, and solutes in contact in these phases. The project targets
              three specific areas for study: 1) use of electronic and vibrational
              spectroscopies along with chemometric curve resolution approaches for the
              characterization of mixed solvent systems, 2 )use of previously developed
              chemometric/solvatochromic methods to characterize a broad range of C18 and C8
              based liquid chromatographic stationary phases, and 3) combinationation of ab
              initio and reaction field techniques to estimate and rationalize transition
              energies for the solvated UV-visible probes used for the chromatographic
              characterization studies. 

Results from this research could lead to  more
              reliable medical diagnostic procedures, improved sorbents for remediation of
              environmental  pollution,  and more efficient  industrial processes.
