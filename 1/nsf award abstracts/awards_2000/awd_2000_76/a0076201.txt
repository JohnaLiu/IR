The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Caleb E. Gordon with 12 months
              of support to work with Dr. Juan Francisco Ornelas at the Instituto de Ecologia
              in Xalapa, Mexico.
Dr. Gordon will investigate biodiversity persistence under
              five coffee cultivation systems in Veracruz, Mexico.  He will sample birds and
              beetles as biodiversity indicators in cultivation systems ranging from low to
              high alteration of the original forest.  The potential compatibility between
              the cultivation of a major cash crop and native biodiversity represents an
              important opportunity to develop management plans that satisfy both the
              socioeconomic needs of developing nations and the needs of biological
              conservation. To design such plans, it is necessary to understand the effects
              of different coffee cultivation strategies on biodiversity.
Central Veracruz
              is an ideal arena to examine this question of biodiversity persistence under
              different coffee cultivation regimes, as it is one of the country's major
              coffee production centers and has a high level of diversity. Dr. Ornelas has
              expertise in bird ecology, natural history, and vocalization.
