Abstract    :
              Reptiles and amphibians in the northern portions of their ranges in North
              America may spend as much as half of their lives hibernating.  Some overwinter
              on land, but many hibernate under water.  Aquatic species avoid freezing by
              hibernating underwater, but they then must switch from aerial to aquatic
              respiration, with its attendant physiological challenges.  However, there have
              been few detailed physiological/ecological studies of naturally hibernating
              aquatic reptiles and amphibians.  The PIs propose to study hibernation and
              overwintering in northern reptiles and amphibians, starting by expanding their
              previous laboratory studies on turtles to include additional turtle species,
              frogs, and wintertime field studies.

The field physiology and behavior of
              naturally hibernating painted turtles, map turtles, snapping turtles,
              softshelled turtles, and bullfrogs from known northern populations in New
              England and Wisconsin will be studied by radiotelemetric tracking. 
              Concurrently, laboratory studies of physiological responses to simulated
              hibernation will be conducted with all species.  Data should allow
              generalizations about physiological/ecological strategies employed during this
              major portion of the life cycle of freshwater reptiles and amphibians, lay the
              groundwork for future studies, and supply information crucial to conservation
              efforts.
