The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Harper L. Simmons with support
              for twenty-four months to work with Dr. Andrew Weaver at the University of
              Victoria's School of Earth and Ocean Sciences in Victoria, Canada.
The PIs
              will work to determine the impact of increased ocean stratification on ocean
              thermohaline circulation and ultimately upon climate variability and stability.
              Specifically, they will implement a known analytical sub-model of small scale,
              but climatically relevant, oceanic overflow processes into a climate model that
              cannot directly simulate such processes.  The analytical model will be driven
              by variables that are resolvable within the context of a climate model, namely
              the large-scale exchange of both moisture and heat between the ocean and
              atmosphere.
An expected result is enhanced dependence of deep water formation
              climate upon Arctic processes, with a concomitant suppression of climate
              sensitivity to more southern open convective processes.  The theoretical
              understanding and modeling technology developed through the course of this
              project will benefit U.S. and international climate modeling activities and
              programs.
The University of Victoria's Climate Modeling Group has expertise in
              the role of the Arctic in climate.  They have a seasoned team of researchers
              and the equipment necessary to carry out this research.
