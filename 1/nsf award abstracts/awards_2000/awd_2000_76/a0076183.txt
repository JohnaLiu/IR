The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers 
to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards 
provide opportunities for joint research, and
              the use of unique or complementary 
facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will provide Dr. Mark A. Jordan with support
              for eighteen months to work 
with Dr. William Jordan at the Zoological Society
              of London in the United Kingdom.  
They will study gene flow as a constraint
              on adaptive evolution, a test in a polymorphic 
population of
              lizards.


Theory predicts that gene flow should constrain local adaptive
              evolution.  The principal 
investigator proposes to test this hypothesis using
              a population of Galapagos lava lizards 
that is polymorphic for traits
              associated with locomotor performance.  He will use 
microsatellite DNA
              markers to determine the amount of gene flow within the population.  
High
              levels of gene flow will suggest that natural selection must be severe to
              maintain 
microgeographic variation in performance.

Dr. William Jordan and
              his colleagues at the Institute of Zoology have extensive 
experience in the
              application of molecular techniques for the analysis of microsatellites in
              
natural populations.  The principal investigator will also travel to Ecuador
              and will 
involve students from there to help with his fieldwork.  This
              research will benefit 
ongoing conservation efforts in the Galapagos.  This
              project will allow estimates of 
population structure and effective population
              size:  measures that are critical in making 
informed management decisions.
