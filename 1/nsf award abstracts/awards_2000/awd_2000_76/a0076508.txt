This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research
              program to Tuskegee Institute, George Washington Carver Foundation is for the
              acquisition of two new instruments, a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (DMA) and a
              Thermomechanical Analyzer(TMA).  The DMA and TMA will establish new research
              capabilities at Tuskegee University and will be very useful in characterizing
              structure-processing- property relationships of advanced materials that are the
              focus of both current and future research.  Polymers and polymer-based
              composites are primarily studied at Tuskegee.  Several students in a newly
              established doctoral degree program in materials will benefit significantly
              from the use of these instruments in their dissertation research, with an
              additional eight (8) M.S. and six (6 ) undergraduate students in Chemistry,
              Mechanical and Chemical Engineering also using the instrumentation.  Use of
              these instruments will not only enable students to enhance the quality of their
              research, but will also allow them to strengthen the principles learned in the
              classroom with actual "hands-on" experience and significantly broaden their
              exposure to physical characterization of polymers and polymer-based composites.
              Undergraduate students involved in these projects will use their research to
              satisfy their senior project requirements.
