Abstract    :
              Plasmas in which the kinetic energy exceeds the magnetic energy by a significant
              factor are common in space and in the laboratory.  Such plasmas can convect
              magnetic fields and create null points in whose vicinity first the ions become
              unmagnetized, then the electrons.  This project focuses on the detailed study
              of the transition regime of these plasmas.  Experiments within the project will
              address three topics:  1) reconnection at three-dimensional null points
              produced by nonlinear magnetic vortices; 2) small-scale structures such as
              current sheets below the electron inertial scale length; and 3) magnetic
              turbulence and anomalous electron transport.
