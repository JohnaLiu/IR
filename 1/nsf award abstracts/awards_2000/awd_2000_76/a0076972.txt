Abstract    :
              Color vision is an aspect of the visual world of humans and many animals but our
              understanding of the neural processes mediating color vision remains
              incomplete. Normal humans, rhesus monkey, and goldfish all have three cone
              types (trichromacy) and can discriminate the color of light at detection
              threshold intensity. Dichromatic ('color blind') humans have only two cone
              types (dichromacy) and cannot discriminate the color of light at detection
              threshold intensity. This suggests that either trichromacy is necessary for
              high color vision sensitivity or that dichromatic humans have a deficit in
              color vision sensitivity because dichromacy is an abnormal condition in humans.
              To decide between these two possibilities behavioral color discrimination
              thresholds will be measured in normally dichromatic ground squirrels using food
              reward. If ground squirrels cannot discriminate the color of spectral lights at
              threshold intensities this will suggest that trichromacy is necessary for high
              color vision sensitivity. On the other hand if ground squirrels can
              discriminate the color of spectral lights at threshold intensities this will
              suggest that dichromatic humans have a post-receptoral color vision deficit and
              that high sensitivity is one of color vision's evolutionary advantages in both
              normal dichromats and trichromats.
