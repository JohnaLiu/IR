This award provides support for graduate students,
              postdoctoral fellows and young faculty members to attend the Spring Materials
              Research Society Symposium BB: The Granular State.  The symposium will be held
              in San Francisco, CA, on April 24-26, 2000.  

The past decade has seen an
              explosive growth of interest in the physics of the granular state.  Granular
              media are comprised of macroscopic objects with internal degrees of freedom. 
              Granular assemblies exhibit phenomena that cut across the properties of
              traditional solids, liquids and gases.  Hence, one can think of the granular
              state as a unique state.  In many ways, the granular state is a generalized
              state of matter.

The symposium will provide and interdisciplinary forum for
              the discussion of recent advances in granular materials research.  The
              fifty-seven presentations are distributed among researchers in physics,
              mathematics and mechanical, civil, and chemical engineering.  Participants come
              from universities, national laboratories and industry, and from twelve
              countries.
