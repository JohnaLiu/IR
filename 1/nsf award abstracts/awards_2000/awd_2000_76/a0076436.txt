Abstract    :
              The ecological and evolutionary success of bony fishes, the most speciose group
              of vertebrates, is associated with extensive diversity in feeding biology that
              is facilitated by versatile systems of prey capture and processing.  This
              research will elucidate mechanisms of function in the pharyngeal jaw apparatus
              of ray-finned fishes, the primary device used in manipulating, chewing, and
              transporting prey during feeding.  The pharyngeal jaw apparatus is a poorly
              understood, complex system of modified gill-arch muscles and bones that has
              underdone extensive modification during fish evolution.  Using recordings of
              muscle activity and a new method for visualizing skeletal motion inside the
              skull, sonometric-ultrasound, this research will test models of pharyngeal jaw
              function in several major groups of fishes in order to establish the mechanisms
              of jaw action and its evolution within the largest group of living vertebrates.
                                                                 This research will address
              basic questions about how the muscle-skeleton linkage system of the pharyngeal
              jaw apparatus functions, and how it has been modified during evolution to
              produce novel function and diversity in feeding biology.  The complexity and
              diversity of this system will provide the raw material for exposing general
              principles of neuromuscular evolution.
