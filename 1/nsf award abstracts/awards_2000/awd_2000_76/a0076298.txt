Abstract    :
              The Arctic is predicted to be the first place to sense global warming due to the
              climate feedbacks created from melting of snow and ice cover at high latitudes.
               This project establishes an office that will facilitate collection of
              information from a multidisciplinary group of Arctic researchers who have
              individually determined that a significant warming of the Arctic environment
              has been underway for at least a decade.  The office will gather information
              and conduct planning activities for the Study of Environmental Arctic Change
              (SEARCH) project in order to assess the cause and effects for a warming of the
              Arctic that may be related to initiation of greenhouse warming.  The SEARCH
              office will serve as the focus for scientific planning of a research program
              that will be designed to support a coordinated, interagency effort to gather
              enough information to assess the causes of the current warming and predict the
              likely progress of the warming trend and its potential impacts on the
              environment and society.
