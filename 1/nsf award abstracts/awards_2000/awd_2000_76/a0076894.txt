Abstract    :
              This project is in support of the 2000 Gordon Research Conference on Solid-State
              Chemistry.  The invited speakers represent Academia, Industrial Laboratories
              and National Laboratories.  World-class scientists who represent a broad
              cross-section of currently active areas of the field have been invited, and
              many younger scientists are included in the program, promising to make the
              presentations and discussions representative of new directions in the field. 
              NSF support will enable graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty
              from undergraduate institutions to attend the conference.

Solid-State
              Chemistry continues to have a direct impact on technological advances in areas
              such as photonic, thermoelectric, and superconductory materials for devices,
              all of which are included as topics in this conference.
