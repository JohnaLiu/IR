Abstract    :
              Professor Thomas DeVore of James Madison University is funded by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental studies on
              chemical reactions occuring during the industrial process of chemical vapor
              deposition (CVD).  These reactions have been difficult to study in the past due
              to the high pressure conditions (1 mbar to ambient pressure). The PI will study
              the chemical reactions of several first row transition metal 2,4-pentanedionato
              complexes under CVD conditions.  Both the kinetics of the thermal decomposition
              of these complexes on heated glass substrates and their reactions with water or
              molecules produced by the thermal decomposition will be studied. Evolved Gas
              Analysis - Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy will be used.  The mechanism
              of thermal decomposition will also be studied using differential scanning
              calorimetry.  The PI then proposes to perform parallel studies on transition
              metal acetates.  A successful outcome of this proposal would be a model to
              predict the chemical reactions that could occur during CVD processes.  
              

Chemical vapor deposition is an industrial process used to coat objects
              with thin films of material and to produce ultra-pure chemical compounds. 
              Optimization of these processes require some understanding of the chemical rate
              constants involved in the reactions.  This study will gather kinetic data and
              will attempt to explain the data in terms of mechanisms and energetics of the
              processes.  James Madison University is an undergraduate institution, and
              several undergraduate students are actively involved in this work.
