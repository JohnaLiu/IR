Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Miami University  will acquire a
              stopped-flow UV-VIS spectrophotometer.  Research will focus on the following
              studies: a) chemistry of carcinogenic esters derived from heterocyclic aromatic
              amines; b) oxidation-reduction reactions of oxyhalogen species and ozone in
              aqueous solution; c) kinetic mechanism of metallo-beta-lactamases; and d) study
              of glyoxalase II.  

Stopped-flow spectroscopy is critical for the study of
              rapid chemical reactions, as it enables the detection of ultraviolet or visible
              light-absorbing short-lived intermediates.  These studies will have an impact
              in a variety of areas including environmental sciences and biochemistry.
