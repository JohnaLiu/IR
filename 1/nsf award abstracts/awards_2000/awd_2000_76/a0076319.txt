Abstract    :
              This is funding to subsidize travel and housing expenses of a select group of US
              graduate students to attend the ACM International Conference on Autonomous
              Agents (AGENTS 2000), to be held June 3-7 in Barcelona, Spain.  This is the
              premier conference devoted entirely to agents research, an area of artificial
              intelligence which is central to the success of the World Wide Web and the
              Internet revolution.  Attending the conference will allow a diverse group of
              graduate students whose research spans a range of topic areas and methodologies
              to present their work to and receive feedback from the agents community.   The
              students will be selected by a committee, and special mentoring activities will
              be planned for them with the goal of fostering interactions with senior
              researchers.   This, in turn, will help set the directions of future research
              in the field, and guarantee continued growth and development of agents
              technology.
