Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington
              will acquire ultrafast lasers and other equipment for an ultrafast optical
              spectroscopy center. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including a) the characterization of optical and nonlinear optical phenomena in
              condensed matter materials; b) studies of energy transfer and electron transfer
              by which plants and photosynthetic bacteria capture the energy of sunlight; c)
              investigation of the dynamics of halogen-containing compounds; and d) studies
              of the twisting and bending dynamics of various linear and circular DNAs and
              DNA/protein complexes.  

Ultrafast spectroscopy allow scientists to
              investigate chemistry that occurs in the picosecond (10^-12) and femtosecond
              (10^-15) time regimes.  On these extremely short timescales, atoms move and
              bonds between atoms are broken or formed.  Ultrafast optical techniques allow
              for the investigation of chemical reaction dynamics during the course of the
              reaction itself.  The detailed picture of chemical reaactivity provided by
              ultrafast spectroscopy has allowed researchers to explore how plants harvest
              solar energy, to create new and more efficient optoelectronic materials, and to
              understand the fundamental steps in many environmental processes.  In short,
              ultrafast spectroscopy holds the promise of unraveling the microscopic details
              of chemical reactivity.
