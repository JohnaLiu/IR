Abstract    :
              The Archbold Biological Station has proposed to conduct a planning workshop to
              develop the interdisciplinary capability and conceptual breadth of NEON, the
              National Ecological Observatory Network. The workshop will be held from 10-12
              January 2000. Workshop facilitator is Dr. Martyn Caldwell of Utah State
              University. The goals of the workshop are to:

develop some broad ecological
              concepts that can be addressed by NEON,

determine the types of
              infrastructure needed for observatories in NEON, 

address management issues
              for NEON infrastructure,

discuss coordination of research within and among
              NEON sites, and

provide advice on the challenges of overcoming the
              sociological and institutional barriers associated with colaborative research
              that is multi-institution, large-scale, and broadly
              interdisciplinary.

Introductory sessions and reports by breakout groups will
              be broadcast on the world wide web. The workshop will result in a report
              submitted to NSF.
