Abstract    :
              
This is an instrument development award to Texas Tech university for
              Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) research.
              Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) devices generally range from a few
              microns to a few millimeters in size. This area of technological development
              that has gone from generating curiosities such as wobble motors and
              micro-robots, to its current phase in which practical devices of common usage,
              such as accelerometers and pressure-sensing transducers, are being manufactured
              and used. This has created a need for improved characterization of MEMS
              materials to better optimize the MEMS design process. The objective of this
              research is to design and build a tensile tester for MEMS materials. The tester
              will be used to determine the elastic properties of MEMS material specimens.
              The tester will allow simultaneous loading of specimens in two perpendicular
              directions. It will also accommodate specimens of different sizes; allow
              alignment of the specimen; apply and measure the load on the specimen; monitor
              specimen deformation; and permit continuous data acquisition. Several projects
              related to MEMS materials characterization benefit from the development of this
              micro-tensile tester. Additionally, the proposed development of the
              micro-tensile tester will enhance research facilities in the Departments of
              Electrical and Mechanical Engineering at Texas Tech University. Also, it
              provides the required infrastructure for a student, who previously worked on a
              related capstone senior design project, to commence his graduate degree.
              Furthermore, the existence of this micro-tensile tester will allow potential
              interaction with the MEMS research facility at Sandia National
              Laboratory.
