Abstract    :
              Computer graphics has made great advances in producing realism and detail in
              synthetic scenes, yet these techniques have not been applied to scientific
              visualization. A realistic-looking 3D scene is immediately and viscerally
              apprehended, which promotes understanding of its contents. Fidelity of shading
              is important to a person viewing an already-familiar architectural environment.
              Such fidelity is even more important for a person viewing the complicated and
              unfamiliar geometry of isosurfaces and field lines that reveal the features in
              a dataset resulting from computational simulation or from physical measurement.
              This project will develop global illumination techniques for isosurfaces and
              field lines in 3D data, with applications to medical data and engineering data.
