Abstract    :
              This proposal is aimed at creating TCP autotuning so the TCP applications  take
              full advantage of the available bandwidth without the need for off-line manual
              tuning by the experts. Part of the work is to the design of 
TCP Management
              Information Base (MIB) first for identifying where the performance bottleneck
              is (receiver, transmitter or the network path itself) and then use that
              information for performing automatic and dynamic TCP tuning at the level of the
              user process (autotuning). The primary application focus of this effort is on
              the scientific bulk data transfer using FTP. Implementation of an optimized FTP
              code is part of this work.  In parallel with the development effort the project
              will also pursue substantial user support services and vendor liaison. The
              development will be based on the commodity Intel hardware and Linux OS,
              however, the goal is for other OS vendors to adopt and incorporate TCP
              autotuning in their kernels.
