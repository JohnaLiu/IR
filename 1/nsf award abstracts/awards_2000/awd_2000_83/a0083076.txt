              ABSTRACT

OCE-0083076

Scientists at the Bermuda Biological Laboratory for
              Research will convene a workshop to organize the several ocean time-series
              activities currently operating in the Sargasso Sea in the vicinity of Bermuda
              into a cooperative scientific confederation.  These include the U.S.JGOFS
              Bermuda Atlantic Time Series Station (BATS), the Bermuda Testbed Mooring, the
              Deuser-Conte Ocean Time Series (OTS), and a number or related activities. 
              These activities collectively constitute one of the most intensive and
              internationally utilized -- and acclaimed -- ocean observation systems in the
              world.  Hundreds of scientists at the leading oceanographic institutions in
              North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia have either participated directly in
              the field activities of these facilities (especially BATS) or else have
              utilized the open data sources that they provide.

The workshop, planned for
              autumn 2000 in Bermuda, will have several objectives:  (1) to provide the
              opportunity for the principals of the component activities to meet one another;
              (2) to identify common needs and goals; (3) to articulate the means for
              achievement of these goals; (3) to lay the groundwork for a more formalized
              organization; (5) to develop an organizational and leadership structure; (6) to
              identify and develop linkages to and methods for data exchange with relevant
              international marine research activities; and (7) to establish linkages with
              other time series programs, especially in the North Atlantic.
