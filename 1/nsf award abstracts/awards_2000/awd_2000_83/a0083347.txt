Abstract    :
              The PI and his team will explore solutions to the problem of access to computer
              graphics for blind users by combining a limited number of sensors and
              stimulators with the very high human capacity for fine movement control and
              spatial localization.   He will conduct experiments to determine performance
              with a large number of skin stimulation points (by means of linked
              photosensor-to-vibratory stimulator units) on the hand, thus permitting
              individual finger motion (e.g., finger spreading) as well as total hand motion.
                Both the PI's own prior work and sensorimotor studies by others, along with
              concepts of the role of motor outflow brain signals in determining precise
              spatial localization, have led him to the hypothesis that a haptic system - as
              opposed to one which is strictly tactile, because the fingertips actively scan
              the display - can convey important spatial concepts from 2D and 3D images on a
              computer monitor.   The PI's approach is based on concepts of brain plasticity
              underlying his prior sensory substitution studies, which have demonstrated that
              blind persons can obtain complex visual information in real-time through TV
              cameras leading to tactile interfaces.  The current project will result in a
              tool for perceptual, electrophysiological and brain imaging (e.g., transcranial
              electromagnetic stimulation) studies on sensory substitution and late brain
              plasticity, and to practical applications for science education of blind
              students as well as for increasing their vocational opportunities in
              information technology.
