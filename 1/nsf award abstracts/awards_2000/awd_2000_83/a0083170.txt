Abstract    :
              The 5th International Symposium on Radiative Corrections (RADCOR-2000) will be
              co-hosted by the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics and the Stanford
              Linear Accelerator Center.  The conference will be held from September 11-15,
              2000.  The conference will bring together theorists and experimentalists in
              elementary particle physics in a highly interactive format to confront the
              Standard Model of the elementary particles and basic forces, and its possible
              extensions, with a wide range of observational data.  The unifying theme of the
              conference will be small effects which can be predicted with some precision,
              and so can serve to test the Standard Model and to search for new physics
              beyond it.  Such effects have already taught us a great deal about the Standard
              Model and about possible new physics.  A conference to consider the recent and
              future study of such effects will be very worthwhile.
