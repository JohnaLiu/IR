Abstract    :
              This study will refine and use a new index of calcite dissolution to reconstruct
              vertical carbonate dissolution gradients through the mid-depth regions of the
              Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans over the last glacial - interglacial
              cycle.   The new index is sensitive to dissolution above and across the
              foraminifer lysocline.  The improved information on carbonate ion content and
              gradients will provide constraints on model results of past oceanic carbon
              budgets and thus test model inferences about past atmospheric pCO2 changes
              during glacial-interglacial cycles.
