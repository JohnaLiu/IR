This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
              Massachusetts provides technical personnel and hardware to support and extend
              the existing SeaNet program to provide Internet and other computer
              communications capabilities between vessels conducting oceanographic research
              at sea and facilities on shore.  SeaNet is a development bringing enhanced
              communications protocols to research vessels of the U.S. academic research
              fleet.  This capability substantially enhances efforts for outreach and K-12
              educational activities, in particular, for researchers combining real-time
              research projects at sea with public and elementary education activities. 
              SeaNet also offers vessel operators substantial benefits in managing shipboard
              communications, including both electronic mail and large data file transfers,
              on behalf of scientific users of the vessel, and it provides common protocols
              and high-speed access to satellite communications.  Already implemented on six
              academic research vessels, the present award will provide for addition of four
              new systems as well as support of operations, maintenance of hardware and
              software, and some enhanced communications capabilities.
