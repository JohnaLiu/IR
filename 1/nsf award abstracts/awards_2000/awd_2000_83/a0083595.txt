Abstract:
This Biocomplexity incubation activity
              proposal will study the emergent properties of ecological systems by applying
              new techniques from algebraic combinatorics, as well as methods from
              mathematical logic and statistical physics.  Based on these methods, we will
              develop an integrated conceptual framework to analyze global properties arising
              from the connectivity structure among species and their constraints.  Within
              this framework, the researchers will analyze specific ecosystems, by employing
              a set of formal mathematical/combinatorial tools.  

To accomplish these
              goals the project includes the following activities: regular meetings of
              project personnel and visitors to collaborate and create a common knowledge
              base; a four-day international workshop hall on "The mathematics of network
              dynamics in biological, social, and economic systems;" and simulation and
              analysis of specific systems. The results of these simulations will be used to
              refine our theoretical approach.
