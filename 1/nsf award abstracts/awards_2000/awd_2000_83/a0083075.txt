Abstract    :
              This study will develop empirically grounded models and theories of the social
              processes, technical system configurations, organizational contexts, and
              interrelationships that give rise to open software. "Open software", or more
              narrowly, open source software, represents a new approach for communities of
              like-minded participants to develop software systems that are intended to be
              shared freely, rather than offered as commercial products. While there is a
              growing popular literature attesting to open software, there is little in the
              way of careful systematic empirical study that informs how such communities
              produce software; how they coordinate software development across different
              settings; and what social processes, work practices, and organizational
              contexts are necessary to their success. Thus, to the extent that science
              research communities and commercial enterprises seek the supposed efficacy of
              open software, they will need better grounded theories of use to allow
              effective investment of their resources. This study investigates four
              communities engaged in open software. Field study methods will be employed to
              examine each community from both a technical and social viewpoint. Studying
              both social and technical arrangements allows the examination of the continual
              emergence of both within a joint social-technical ecology. Case study methods
              will be used to compare across communities.
