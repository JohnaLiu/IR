Biological invasions, acting in conjunction with climatic
              variability and spatial heterogeneity, are generating rapid ecological and
              evolutionary change in native ecosystems.  Understanding how spatial and
              temporal dynamics shape the invasion process requires multiple integrated
              approaches.  This project is designed to develop a consortium of natural and
              social scientists to advance our understanding of the current and future state
              of ecological systems in California.  The consortium will combine two
              approaches.  First, museum collections and historical data on invasions and
              climate will be analyzed and synthesized.  Second, the group will coordinate
              monitoring and replicated experiments on the ways in which landscape context
              and climatic cycles shape the pulsed structure of invasions, rapid evolution
              within communities, food web and ecosystem dynamics, and regional patterns of
              biotic change.  This research will lead to a practical and predictive
              understanding of environmental change and be of significant value to policy
              makers and resource managers.
