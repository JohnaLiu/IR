It is well known that urbanization results in severe
              degradation of urban streams, particularly headwater streams.  Various
              scientific and engineering groups are studying the problem, but there remains
              to be an organized project with sufficient funding to combine the talents of
              scientists from various disciplines (such as biology geomorphology, and
              sociology), with engineering specialists in ecologic hydraulics and urban
              drainage to develop an approach to urban stormwater management that will result
              in ecologically sustainable streams and lakes in the urban environment.

This
              Incubation Activity proposes to combine the talents of scientists and engineers
              at Colorado State University, in partnership with two rapidly growing cities in
              the front range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, to lay the groundwork for a
              larger project, which is to develop and test a "Sustainable Urban Stream and
              Reservoir Model" that can be used to design urban drainage systems that will
              result in ecologically sustainable urban water resources for cities in the arid
              west.  The algorithm should be transferable to eastern climates, which have
              more precipitation, and more evenly distributed seasonal precipitation.  As
              currently envisioned, the model to be developed will combine 1) An urban runoff
              model; 2) An urban stream geomorphologic model; and 3) A water quality/ecologic
              model for streams and lakes into a single model or linked models that can be
              used by scientists, engineers and planners to assess the ecologic impact of
              proposed urban development, and/or aid in the design of urban stormwater
              drainage facilities to prevent ecologic degradation.  In the arid west, we
              believe that we can actually ecologically enhance existing natural streams
              because of the increase in stream baseflow that generally accompanies
              urbanization of a watershed.
