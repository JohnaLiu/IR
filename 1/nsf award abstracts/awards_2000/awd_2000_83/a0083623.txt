Global changes are affecting ecosystems worldwide, and some of
              the strongest effects are in the arid lands of the southwestern US.  In
              response to recent droughts, trees have died in large numbers and harmful
              insects have expanded to record levels.  How these changes impact plants,
              animals and microbes may change the way entire ecosystems function, thereby
              affecting human populations living in arid areas.  We have assembled a team of
              researchers in ecology, genetics, physiology and soil science who have studied
              the soil microbes that help plants acquire nutrients from the soil, the insects
              that attack drought-stressed trees, and the importance of birds and mammals in
              one of the largest forest types of the southwestern US.  We propose to hold a
              workshop and virtual meetings so that these experts may develop new
              collaborations and determine areas of future research that will best meet the
              challenges of global change in arid environments.  The goals of this workshop
              are to expand our understanding of complex ecological processes by
              incorporating other disciplines and technologies, like computer modeling and
              stable isotope analysis, to predict the likely impacts of global change on
              ecological and genetic systems.
