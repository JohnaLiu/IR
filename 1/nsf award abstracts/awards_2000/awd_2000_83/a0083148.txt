Abstract    :
              The goal of this collaborative research project involving Christos Faloutsos and
              Ngai Hang Chang at Carnegie Mellon (award 0083148) and Tara Madhyastha at U of
              Cal Santa Cruz (award 0083130) is to develop and apply statistical and
              datamining tools to analyze bursty time sequences, with emphasis on I/O traffic
              optimization. The interdisciplinary team includes researchers in computer
              science, computer engineering and statistics, and industry collaborators. The
              approach has three parts: (1) advanced statistical tools using the ``ARFIMA''
              method; (2) wavelets and the related ``80-20 law'' to model disk traffic; and
              (3) incorporation of these models
inside the so-called ``Active Disks'', with
              the goal to build self-tuning, adaptive disk subsystems.
The results will
              advance data mining and statistics as well as disk design. An easy-to-use
              toolkit "T-REX" will aid in I/O and systems design, handling bursty traffic,
              and better buffering and prefetching. The theory behind the T-REX toolkit will
              be based on new data mining algorithms and statistical methods that model
              self-similar time sequences (like web and network traffic,
in addition to I/O
              traffic). The research team has strong ties with database, data mining and disk
              manufacturing industrial groups, and this will aid in testing the research
              toolkit and its technology transfer. It can be expected that the T-REX system
              will significantly aid the design of disk sub-systems with beneficial impact on
              the storage industry.
