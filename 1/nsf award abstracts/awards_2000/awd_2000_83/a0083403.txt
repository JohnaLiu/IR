FSML Housing for Visiting Researchers and
              Students at Friday Harbor Laboratories

The Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL)
              of the University of Washington has initiated a program to invite up to 8
              research groups/year, each group made up of an independent researcher plus
              her/his graduate and post-doctoral colleagues and 5-8 undergraduate
              apprentices, to conduct research at FHL for a 3-month period. Four such groups
              were selected and invited to FHL in 1999, and 6 in 2000, with FHL providing
              laboratory and field facilities plus full salary to the faculty, graduate
              research assistants, and support personnel (computer staff, marine and
              instrumentation technologists, administrative staff), and stipends to the
              student participants. FHL will expand this program to incorporate groups from
              around the US and abroad.  FHL plans to provide an increased, intense, academic
              year opportunity for research people and undergraduate apprentices to take
              advantage of FHL field, laboratory and housing facilities, and to focus upon
              current, important research opportunities in marine sciences.  In order for the
              station to be able to accommodate more national/international participants, FHL
              will build two new duplex housing units with financial support provided by this
              award and the University of Washington.

FHL is located at the junction of
              Juan de Fuca and Georgia Straits, at a site of unusual biological diversity.
              FHL supports research from molecular and cell biology along a scale of
              increasing spatial dimensions to animal behavior and community ecology and has
              traditionally encouraged innovative and cross-cutting original research by
              eminent scholars, researchers, and students in wide ranging fields, including
              zoology, oceanography, botany, and basic biomedical sciences.
