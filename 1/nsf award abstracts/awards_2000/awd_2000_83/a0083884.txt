Rivers are currently viewed as linear segments where
              materials spiral downstream in relation to catchment setting and water yield. 
              This project is designed to shift science toward a non-linear, more dynamic
              view that emphasizes energy dispersion and materials retention as the primary
              organizing elements of river ecosystems.  This research is conceptually based
              on the view that alluvial flood plains are regional centers of ecological
              organization, owing to dynamic, non-linear processes linking water and
              materials flux and retention to interactive landscape-forming processes.  This
              interaction creates a complex, dynamic array of resource patches and
              interfaces, thereby producing a regional hot spot of biodiversity (including a
              very wide array of migratory species).  Important modifiers of system dynamics
              include drought, wildfire, flow and geomorphic regulation (dams and revetments)
              and invasions of nonnative species.  The interdisciplinary team will develop an
              expert system derived from available empirical data describing the structure
              and function of alluvial flood plains.  The team will use an existing, novel
              simulator that routes water during specified flows through a large flood plain
              in western Montana.  A primary task is to develop a tactical plan for refining
              the model to allow it to be driven by remotely sensed data.
