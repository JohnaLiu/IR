Abstract    :
              This institute will be operated under the auspices of the Department of 
              Mathematical Sciences and the Center for Nonlinear Analysis  at Carnegie 
              Mellon University.  The institute is a seven-week summer program for 
              
undergraduate students.  Minority and female students are targeted for
              recruitment into the institute.  The primary goal of the institute is to 
              prepare students for and interest them in pursuing graduate work in applied 
              mathematics.  Secondary goals are to acquaint students with modern application
              areas of mathematics and to give them some understanding of the  work involved
              in studying in these areas at the graduate level.  The  institute has operated
              successfully since 1994 under this format.
