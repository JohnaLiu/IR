Peatlands are wetlands that have accumulated significant
              amounts of soil organic matter.  Northern peatlands are an important component
              of the global carbon cycle and contain one-third of the global soil carbon
              pool.  Under a warmer climate, this soil carbon may be oxidized and emitted to
              the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and/or methane, two important greenhouse
              gases, and thus exacerbate human-induced climate change.  Therefore, it is
              important to predict the response of peatlands to climate change.  
The
              objective of this incubation proposal is to bring together two research groups
              that have developed separate models of peatlands which display complex
              behaviors.  One model focuses on feedbacks between carbon accumulation and
              hydrology, whereas the other model focuses on feedbacks between plant
              communities and nutrient availability.  A framework will be developed for a
              comprehensive simulation model that can both (i) simulate the initiation and
              development of peatlands over thousands of years and the resulting pattern of
              different peatland ecosystems that form on the landscape, and (ii) explore
              their shorter term response to climate change.   This model will provide great
              insight into the complex behaviors of these unique ecosystems and will be
              invaluable in predicting the effects and potential feedbacks of climate change
              on peatlands
