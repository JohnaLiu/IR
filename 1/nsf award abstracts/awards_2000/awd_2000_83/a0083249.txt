Abstract    :
              This award is for a project that involves coring and initial analysis of
              sediments in a deep, long-lived bog in the heart of the glaciated Sierra
              Nevada.  The bog is unique in western North America because of its mountain
              location, depth, and potential to preserve sediments that date through most if
              not the entire last glacial cycle (~70,000-120,000 years).   The location is
              particularly crucial, because the bog should record changes in sedimentology,
              slope stability, sediment geochemistry, paleomagnetism, and paleoecology in an
              environment that heretofore has not yielded a continuous record that dates past
              the last glacial maximum (~20,000 year B.P.)  The investigators propose to
              drill through the Tioga outwash in the bog and into the underlying sediments
              recovering continuous core.  They will then do basic analyses of the core
              sediments and obtain enough radiocarbon ages to demonstrate the kind of
              paleoclimate record that is potentially available from the bog.
