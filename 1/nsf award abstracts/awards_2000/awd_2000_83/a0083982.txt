This one-year award supports the participation of 25 U.S.
              junior faculty in the third global engineering education workshop, Educating
              the Engineer for the 21st Century, in Aachen, Germany, October 18-20, 2000, and
              in post-workshop visits to research laboratories in Aachen, Grenoble, France,
              and Lausanne, Switzerland. The organizers of the workshop are Virginia
              Polytechnic Institute and State University, the Institut National Polytechnique
              de Grenoble (INPG), France, the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPF)
              in Switzerland, and the Rheinisch-Wesfalische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) in
              Aachen.  The workshop is a forum of new ideas and concepts for future
              engineering education and will address such issues as the internationalization
              and interdisciplinarity of engineering practice and the impact of information
              technology.  Education versus training, lifelong learning, interaction between
              engineering education, research and industry, and best practices are other
              workshop topics.  Participants will also visit with potential research partners
              at institutions near the partner hosts of the workshop.  The goal is to develop
              future collaborations.  Some areas of interest are information technology,
              communications, transportation, materials, and bioinformatics.  The conference
              organizing institutions propose to track progress in matching researchers of
              like interest.  The workshop website will feature the visit reports of these
              research visits which eventually could be used to determine an institution's
              particular strengths and weaknesses.

The project takes advantage of
              expertise in three world class research and education institutions.  INPG, EPF
              and RWTH offer rigorous engineering education and research programs.  In
              addition, the workshop will lead to sustained institutional ties with these
              European schools and future research collaborations.
