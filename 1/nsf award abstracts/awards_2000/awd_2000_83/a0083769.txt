Abstract    :
              This is a Biocomplexity-Incubation Activity Award in the area of Complex
              Systems.  Complexly organized systems constitute a vital frontier that crosses
              virtually all boundaries of scientific domains.  Progress in exploring this
              realm will require a multi-disciplinary, multi-form approach, involving
              investigators from a range of disciplines.  The Complex Systems Group at Lehigh
              has formed around the central issues of multi-scale and multilevel dynamics,
              emergence, self-organization, and cross-level causation.  This award will
              provide resources to nurture this Group and to assist in the development of a
              full Biocomplexity proposal.
