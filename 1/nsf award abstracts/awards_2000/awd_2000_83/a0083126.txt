Abstract    :
              Recently, a novel approach for runtime verification of complex superscalar
              processors has been proposed. In this approach, every computation is
              dynamically verified by hardware using a form of complete induction. This
              project focuses on extending the notion of inductive dynamic verification to
              the general case of parallel distributed systems. The principles of dynamic
              inductive checking for parallel semantics are investigated. This includes an
              understanding of the characteristics and properties of systems, where the
              approach can be used effectively. The initial vehicles used for developing such
              techniques are the problems of cache coherence and support for sequential
              consistency in shared-memory multiprocessors. As a natural extension of this
              research, the project formulates a method for state machine abstraction, which
              can be applied in the general case. This method rests on the separation of
              architected state from additional implementation state, and the identification
              of that subset of state transitions that correspond to changes in the
              architected state only.
