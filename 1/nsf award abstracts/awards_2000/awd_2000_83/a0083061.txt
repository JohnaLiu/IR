              ABSTRACT

OCE-0083061

Boron isotopes, sensitive to the carbonate system,
              may be an important tool in understanding coral chemistry and has the
              intriguing possibility of tracking changes in pCO2, whether it be global
              changes over long time scales or a record of internal 'carbon pool' conditions
              mediated by the coral itself.  For this reason, the PI will determine the boron
              isotopic composition for two separate sets of cultured coral samples to
              increase our knowledge on the uptake and fractionation of boron isotopes.  One
              suite of coral samples cultured under controlled light intensity and nutrient
              conditions will address whether the interpretation of observed seasonal
              variation in the boron isotopic composition of a natural coral is correct.  The
              second set of corals grown under specified temperature and pCO2 levels, will
              address the influence of these two parameters on the boron isotopic
              composition, as well as specifically answer the question as to whether boron
              isotopes in corals can be used as a paleo-pH proxy.  The potential application
              of boron isotopes as a proxy for pH may provide further insights into our
              understanding of global changes in pCO2 over glacial/interglacial time scales,
              and thus ocean-atmosphere interactions and global climate change.
