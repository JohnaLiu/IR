Abstract    :
              Recommended project for Pb isotopic analysis of olivine-hosted melt inclusions
              from mid-ocean ridge baslats (MORBs) from a geochemically anomalous segment of
              the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), with a goal of examining the origin, amplitude,
              and scale lengths of chemical heterogeneity of the MORB source mantle. 
              Analysis will occur by an innovative, new technique using the ion microprobe to
              analyze melt inculsions that are 40 um or large in size, examining melt
              inclusion isotopic heterogeneity that occurs within individual olivine
              crystals, within individual samples, and within an individual ridge segment. 
              About 50 melt inclusions will be analyzed from a number of individual lavas to
              examine within-flow heterogeneity.  The samples to be analyzed are from 12-16
              degrees N on the MAR, where a range of PB isotopic composition occurs in host
              samples, and include individual samples showing great diversity in their melt
              inclusions compositions.  This data will be used to test and calibrate models
              of mantle melting and melt transport associated with slow spreading ridges such
              as the MAR.
