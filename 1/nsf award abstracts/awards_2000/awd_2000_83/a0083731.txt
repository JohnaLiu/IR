The "paradox of the plankton" was postulated in 1961 to
              emphasize how little we understand about the factors which promote great
              plankton diversity in apparently featureless pelagic regions.  In 1982, the
              supply ratio hypothesis was presented and served as an important contribution
              for understanding how species could coexist on limiting nutrients.  Recent
              modeling and experimental results suggest that very short time scale
              fluctuations, either caused by external forcing factors (nutrient pulses) or
              internal oscillations (chaos) inherent in nutrient-competition or predator-prey
              dynamics, may greatly increase diversity at the base of food webs.  A series of
              interdisciplinary workshops and a symposium will gather researchers to examine
              how temporal and spatial patchiness interacts with food-web oscillations to
              promote diversity.
