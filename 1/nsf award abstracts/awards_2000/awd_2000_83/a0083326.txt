International
              Conference Award:  NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Green Industrial
              Applications of Ionic Liquids


This award supports partially the
              participation by American researchers in the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on
              Green  Industrial Applications of Ionic to be held in Crete, Greece, from April
              12 to 16, 2000. This workshop will deal with an exciting new area of chemistry
              that offers an alternative to toxic and volatile organic solvents for use in
              various types of industrial processing, the use of room-temperature ionic
              liquids.  It will bring together about 50 or so researchers from Europe and the
              US.  Both academic and industrial researchers will participate in sessions on
              separations, electrochemistry, catalysis, chemical syntheses, and other
              industrial applications of ionic liquids.
 
The major funding for the
              workshop is coming from NATO, but this organization has certain
              representational guidelines that limit US participation.  Minor support from
              NSF will be used to pay conference fees and partial travel expenses for US
              participants not covered by NATO funds, including some younger faculty and
              students.  Also, the funding will be used to insure adequate participation by
              industrial organizations. The communication resulting from this conference will
              stimulate the development of ionic liquids and their industrial applications as
              well as promote scientific cooperation between Europe and the U.S.
