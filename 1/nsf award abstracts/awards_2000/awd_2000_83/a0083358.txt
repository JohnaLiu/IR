Abstract    :
              This workshop by the Net@EDU Project within EDUCAUSE and the follow-on
              information dissemination activities are designed to generate an analysis of
              voice-over-IP (VoIP) options, strategies, and best practices.  The results will
              be made available to the community of universities and parties involved in NGI,
              Internet2, and other related initiatives.  VoIP promises to be an important
              technology on emerging, advanced networks.  One of Net@EDU's special interest
              groups has already been working these issues.  They will be 
involved in these
              workshops and already have some useful work done that should help to jump start
              and accelerate this workshop activity and the quality of the proceedings.
