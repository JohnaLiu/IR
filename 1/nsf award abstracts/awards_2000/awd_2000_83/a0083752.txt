 Faculty from the University of Alabama and the University of
              
New Mexico will coordinate development of a Biocomplexity 
research proposal
              that (1) advances our current, limited 
understanding of how droughts are
              initiated and maintained; and 
(2) provides assessments of impacts of drought
              in river basins in 
the contrasting mesic and semi-arid climates of Alabama
              and 
New Mexico.  We will develop a new, quantitative understanding 
of
              biological, hydrological and atmospheric interactions that control
              
initiation, duration, and consequences of drought.  Our ultimate 
goal is to
              understand biotic response to drought well enough to 
make estimates of
              climate feedback and contribute to better 
predictive climate models.  The
              planning proposal will fund 
analyses and integration of relevant data sets
              from both regions, 
travel for faculty exchanges, and full-group workshops to
              facilitate 
preparation of a biocomplexity and other interdisciplinary
              research 
proposals appropriate for this theme.
