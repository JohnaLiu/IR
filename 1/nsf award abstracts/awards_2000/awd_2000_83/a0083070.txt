Abstract    :
              0083070  Farrell  The objective of this research is to investigate the
              mechanisms involved in reductive dechlorination of chlorinated organic
              compounds by metal cathodes.  The kinetics and reaction mechanisms for
              hydrocarbon reductive dechlorination will be investigated using rotating disk
              electrodes.  The catalytic effectiveness of three electrode materials, iron,
              nickel, and palladium, selected to span a range in hydrogen storage capacity,
              overpotential for hydrogen evolution, and metal work function, will be
              investigated.  The reaction rates, reaction byproducts and Faradaic current
              efficiencies for a suite of chlorinated organic compounds, tetrachloroethylene,
              trichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane,
              will be determined for the three electrode materials as a function of electrode
              potential. ***
