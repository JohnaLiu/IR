Abstract    :
              Over the last several decades, the Arctic has experienced unprecedented climate
              change, with dramatic reduction in sea-ice coverage and the warming of both
              lands and oceans.  The driving forces for these changes are currently believed
              to be greenhouse warming and cyclic oscillations in the atmospheric
              circulation.  Ecosystem structure in the more-southerly Bering Sea has been
              dramatically altered and a few scattered observations suggests that alterations
              in food-webs are occurring elsewhere in the more isolated Arctic.  Few
              comprehensive studies of the ecosystem structure and function have been done in
              the enclosed Arctic, yet it is straightforward to expect dramatic and
              non-linear biotic changes.  In this Incubation Activity, the P.I. proposes to
              develop a research plan for studying Arctic environmental change and its impact
              on the ecosystem and society. This proposal would establish a multidisciplinary
              team of experts which would lead 2 workshops over 24 months to develop a
              strategy for evaluating biological and societal impacts of the physical
              environmental changes.
