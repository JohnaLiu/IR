Abstract    :
              This collaborative project involving Drs. A. Robock and D. Robinson of Rutgers
              University and Dr. K. Vinnikov of the University of Maryland will explore the
              connection between snow and soil moisture anomalies and the timing and strength
              of the Indian summer monsoon.  This analysis will include examining the links
              among snow, soil moisture, rainfall and circulation anomalies, and sea surface
              temperatures using special observations and the NCEP reanalysis data.  The
              principal investigators (PIs) will exploit a newly available data base of soil
              moisture observations, with more than 400 stations covering most of Eurasia,
              including the former Soviet Union, Mongolia, China, and India, along with an
              updated data set of snow extent and snow water equivalent observations.  A
              critical part of the activity will be the PIs' careful assessment and quality
              control of the diverse observations that make up the data set.  The data set
              will be made available to the wider community via the web.
