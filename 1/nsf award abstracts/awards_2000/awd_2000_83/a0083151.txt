Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative investigation involving experimental geochemistry and
              microbiology to quantitatively assess the relative roles of microbial activity
              and geochemical mass transport processes in low temperature hydrothermal
              environments.  The study entails both closed and open-system experiments, with
              and without chemolithotrophic thermophiles, cultured at temperatures from
              approximately 70 to 100 degrees Centigrade, and 250 bars.
