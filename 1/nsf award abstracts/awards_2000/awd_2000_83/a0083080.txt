Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop the design methodology, software
              tools and programming environment for the automated synthesis of
              Mission-specific Processors (MSPs) based on the Morphosys architecture
              developed at UC, Irvine. Because their hardware design is not tailored to the
              application(s), generic embedded processor architectures make inefficient use
              of area and power. ASICs on the other hand cannot be updated to accommodate
              different algorithm improvements. By allowing a set of target applications to
              dictate the architecture, MSP designs incorporate the necessary components and
              interconnections to optimize the performance of a specific suite of programs.
              The synthesized architecture is dynamically reconfigurable and supports a
              retargetable compiler to incorporate algorithm enhancements or changing task
              specifications. The proposed approach relies on the compilation of a program
              expressed in a high-level algorithmic language into a data-flow graph (DFG)
              format and from that format into VHDL. This technology has been developed as
              part of the Cameron Project at Colorado State University. A new MSP design
              framework will be developed to incorporate constraint-based MSP synthesis and
              estimation as well as compilation support for the synthesized architecture.
