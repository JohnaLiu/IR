Abstract    :
              
The major issues to be addressed by the life scientists of the 21st Century
              will
require both the admixture of life science disciplines that have
              traditionally been separate
and the inclusion of disciplines that have
              traditionally fallen outside the life sciences.
Achieving these goals is
              largely a matter of social engineering: getting isolated scientists
to
              interact with one another, shifting the training of pre-and post-doctoral
              students from
an oligodisciplinary to a multidisciplinary mode,instituting
              mechanisms for the sharing
of scientific resources, forming interactive
              scientific communities around major topics or
problems,and so on. For some key
              communities, this social engineering is already well
underway,but for others
              it is not. For this reason we propose a series of 'incubation
activities' for
              a potential community we will name 'evolutionary and ecological
              functional
genomics'(EEFG). The proposed incubation activities have two main
              goals:
1. Physical coalescence of this potential community
2. Strategic
              planning by this community,which will identify its scientific,
programmatic,
              and educational goals; and formulate workable structures for achieving
ongoing
              interaction and attaining these goals.
The two goals of the incubation
              activities would be achieved first by a
planning/organizational meeting to be
              held at the National Science Foundation, and then
by a series of outreach
              meetings that would be embedded in the annual meetings of
existing scientific
              societies on an international scale.
