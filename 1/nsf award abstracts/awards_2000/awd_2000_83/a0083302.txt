Abstract    :
              Conflicting trends in the requirements for system design and testing are leading
              to a crisis in existing design-for-test methodologies. The need for design cost
              reduction motivates design approaches which raise the design abstraction level,
              including high level core-based paradigms. While the design abstraction level
              rises, the currently accepted fault model is the single stuck-at model at the
              gate-level. Behavioral fault models are needed which enable both test and
              validation of complex systems. In addition, test approaches are needed target
              high-level fault models and achieve good validation and test coverage. This
              work examines how to use component-specific testability information to target
              pseudo-random resistant (PRR) faults. Since only a few pseudo-random resistant
              faults are typically the source of a disproportionately large fraction of test
              overhead, targeting these faults is a cost effective DFT approach.
