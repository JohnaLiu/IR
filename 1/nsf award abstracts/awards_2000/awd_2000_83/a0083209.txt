Abstract    :
              Surround perception is crucial for an immersive sense of presence in
              communication and for efficient navigation and surveillance in robotics. To
              enable surround perception, new omnidirectional systems
provide a new impetus
              for us to rethink the way images are acquired and analyzed. This project will
              be focused on two fundamental issues: the intrinsic geometric properties of
              catadioptric omnidirectional sensors and the space-variant signal analysis of
              omnidirectional images with non-uniform resolution. The PI has proven in the
              preliminary work that every catadioptric system can be shown to be equivalent
              to a generalized stereographic projection from a virtual sphere to the real
              image plane. He intends to develop a unifying framework for all catadioptric
              systems,  where conventional perspective cameras will be just a special case,
              and exhaustively study invariants of the projections on reflective urfaces as
              well as efficient representations for reconstruction and
motion estimation.
              Catadioptric designs need a new signal-theoretic treatment
              since
shift-invariant processing does not apply in the non-uniform resolution
              of omnidirectional images. This research will make use of integral transforms
              that map the 2D signal to
the spatial-frequency domain of a plane with
              virtually uniform resolution. The investigation will be extended from the
              simple edge detection to template matching and to the computation of optical
              flow in omnidirectional images.
