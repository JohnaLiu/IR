Abstract    :
              This project will perform fundamental investigations of the strenghts and
              limitations of the low-level human visual system.  It will seek to identify
              image properties that people can see quickly, to test how those properties
              interact with one another, and to determine how to harness those properties. 
              Understanding how we perceive the world around us will benefit many research
              areas including information display, image generation, image analysis, and the
              simulation of vision.  This project will apply this knowledge to an important
              area of computer graphics:  the visualization of large, complex,
              multidimensional datasets.  The goal in this area is to design visualizations
              that support rapid and accurate exploration and analysis of such complex data. 
              To do this, the project must display all of the data without overwhelming the
              viewer's visual system.  It will solve this problem by constructing a
              perceptual visualization architecture, which will inclued a "visualization
              assistant".  This assistant will use artificial intelligence search techniques
              to help viewers choose perceptually optimal methods of converting their data
              into effective visualizations.
