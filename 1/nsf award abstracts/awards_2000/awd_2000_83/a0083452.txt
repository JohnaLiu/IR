This project will investigate how processes such as water flow,
              fire, wind, and other disturbances interact in a forested landscape.  The work
              will involve an exploration of how parts of landscape (elements) are linked
              together by these processes.  The results will be used to develop a general
              framework to analyze and predict the behaviors of landscapes.  This framework
              will separate processes that occur in a place versus those that link places.
              The latter set of processes can be used to define landscape versus ecosystem
              behavior.  The framework will change perspectives of scientists and managers
              from one in which landscapes are viewed as patterns of elements to a
              perspective in which landscapes are viewed as places where interactions among
              processes vary according to the arrangement of landscape elements.  The former
              view emphasizes pattern, whereas the latter emphasizes processes.  This project
              will not only advance scientific understanding of the biocomplexity of
              landscapes, but will also allow land managers to manage natural resources at
              appropriate scales and in a sustainable manner.
