Abstract    :
              The conference "Strings 2000" will be held at the University of Michigan July
              10-15, 2000.  This will be a major conference devoted to superstring theory and
              its M-theory generalizations, which hold promise of unifying all the
              fundamental forces of nature.  There has been significant recent progress in
              this area, including the discovery of "duality relations" showing the
              equivalence of seemingly unrelated theories.  This conference, at which many
              leading scientists in superstring theory will exchange ideas, is very important
              to further progress.
