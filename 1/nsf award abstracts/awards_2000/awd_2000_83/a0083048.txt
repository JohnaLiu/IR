Abstract    :
              This project will develop a multiresolution numerical methodology for solving
              the partial differential equations of fluid dynamics on the sphere, and apply
              it to practical atmospheric-flow simulations.  Its starting point is the
              spectral-element method (SEM), which retains the spectral accuracy of
              spherical-harmonic transform methods, without the latter's problems near the
              poles.  Observing that the spatial discretization via SEM and via multiwavelets
              (on the finest scale) are the same, the researchers will develop an adaptive
              multiresolution multiwavelet solver, and test it using standard atmospheric
              simulation benchmarks.

Although it is well understood that atmospheric
              phenomena involve strong multiscale interactions, today there are no adaptive
              multiresolution solvers.  The necessary mathematical tools that take the
              multiscale nature of the problem into account have appeared only recently, and
              form the foundation for this research.  The success of this project will have a
              significant impact on both the speed and the accuracy of atmospheric
              simulations and weather prediction.
