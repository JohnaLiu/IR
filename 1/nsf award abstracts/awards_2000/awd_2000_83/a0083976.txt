Abstract    :
              The processes that govern the population dynamics of nearshore benthic species ?
              larval production and transport, larval settlement, local disturbance,
              predation, competition for space, etc ? are each complex.  For example, larval
              settlement depends not only upon the rate of arrival of larvae but also the
              availability of free substrate, larval behavior, and small?scale hydrodynamics.
               Each of these processes is nonlinear and has been studied separately. The
              principle investigators have already been successful in identifying some of
              these processes. But because each one is complex and operates at a different
              temporal and spatial scale, little progress has been made in coupling them
              together. This project should increase understanding of these processes using,
              a combination of observational and mathematical techniques. The following will
              also be investigated: whether alongshore differences in recruitment, larval
              transport, and larval dispersal result from the differences in local
              stratification, and whether the behavior of the larvae interacting with the
              local stratification results in differences in larval transport.
