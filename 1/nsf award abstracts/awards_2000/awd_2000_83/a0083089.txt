Abstract    :
              A state-of-the-art H.323 video communications network will be built to promote
              systemic reform in research in Louisiana.  The network will interconnect eleven
              institutions of higher education and the Board of Regents and offer linkages to
              other networks and campuses.  Specifically, a state-of-the-art
              desktop-to-desktop video conferencing research system will be developed at
              institutions that provide leadership of state-wide research and educational
              programs such as the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
              (EPSCoR) or the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP).  The
              network will:  (1) provide Louisiana researchers with tools for participating
              in inter-institutional scientific sharing and strategic planning session; (2)
              showcase EPSCoR's strategy for enhancing the state's research competitiveness;
              and (3) build a prototype statewide H.323 network in Louisiana.  The project
              will upgrade existing audio/video network from H.320 to H.323 and install sixty
              H.323 desktop endpoints, 5 at each of the 12 sites.  A Multipoint Control Unit
              will be purchased to create a Network Operations Center that allows for network
              management from remote sites.  The network will reduce geographical barriers so
              inter-institutional collaboration can figure strongly into the state's systemic
              plan to enhance academic research competitiveness.  The initiative will become
              a component in a regional network being built on a robust Abilene/vBNS
              connection to Southern Crossroads.
