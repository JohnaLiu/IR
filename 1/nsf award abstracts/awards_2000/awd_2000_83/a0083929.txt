An interdisciplinary collaboration will apply recently
              developed techniques for analyzing computer networks to the study of complexity
              in large food webs.  The focus of the research is the scaling of complexity
              with diversity, especially the statistical relationships between the numbers of
              nodes and links in Internet, WWW, and ecological networks.  The strikingly
              robust patterns in the way network complexity scales with diversity along with
              the ability of this scaling relationship to underpin successful network models
              form the scientific basis of the collaboration.  Recent insights into these
              scaling relationships have made fundamental advances in understanding networks.
               This project synergistically integrates scientists responsible for several of
              these advances to increase the scientific productivity of biocomplexity
              research.  The project will use insights into the scaling of complexity to
              predict the relationship between diversity and the structure and function of
              ecological networks.  Workshops will gather several researchers to exchange
              data and analytical methods to use computers to study both networks and models
              of networks as well as the effects of losing nodes and species on networks.
