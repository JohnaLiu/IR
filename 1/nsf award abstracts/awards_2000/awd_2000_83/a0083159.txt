Abstract    :
                   This Small Grant project proposes to organize an international conference
              for presentation and discussion of models of partnership between universities
              and small manufacturing companies in the US and around the world that have
              proven to be efficient and effective. While major corporations have long been
              involved in such partnerships for research and development of new technologies,
              it makes even more sense for smaller manufacturers to do so, because they often
              lack R&D capabilities themselves; because smaller firms as a whole now hire
              more new graduates than larger companies; and because smaller firms are often
              more community oriented. The Advanced Manufacturing Institute of Kansas State
              University through its Manufacturing Learning Center and support from NSF, NIST
              and the Society of Manufacturing Engineers has developed an innovative model
              that integrates education and training, research, and economic development in
              partnership with a large number of small-to-medium-sized manufacturing
              companies. Other models of such partnerships exist elsewhere around the world.
              This conference will provide a forum for presentation and discussion of both
              the Kansas State activities and other successful working partnerships from
              around the world, thus publicizing the results of earlier NSF-supported
              research and extending the prior effort.
