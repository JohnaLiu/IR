Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the problem of recovery, representation, and
              recognition of shapes in images. The PI 
proposes to use the symmetry map, the
              shock graph of an edge map, as an intermediate-level representation for 2D
              shape. Deformations of shape are then expressed as a sequence of symmetry
              transforms which correspond to the inherent instabilities of skeletons (shock
              transitions). The optimal deformation path between two shapes is found using an
              edit distance approach to finding the least action sequence of  transforms, or
              edits, on the shock graph. The cost of this path is used as a dissimilarity
              measure for indexing into image databases. This approach also allows for shape
              modeling and design, the construction of morphing sequences, and deformable
              templates. In 3D, The PI proposes to reduce the three-dimensional skeleton to a
              shock scaffold consisting of 1D space curves on which the 3D skeleton can be
              analytically constructed, leading to significant savings in recovery and
              storage of complex shapes, e.g., Michelangelo's Pieta, human lungs, etc. The
              research is generic and can potentially significantly impact a number of
              industrial and medical applications, including shape-based retrieval and
              construction of computational atlases.
