Abstract    :
              
Trace elements, especially those that may be used as paleoproxies, behave as
              lattice impurities that regulate biomineralization and provide critical
              information on crystal growth history.  For example, incorporation of Mg2+ has
              been shown to modify the morphology, solubility and polymorphic expression of
              CaCO3 biominerals.  In addition, Mg2+ is the principal inhibitor of calcite
              growth in natural waters, thereby influencing the size and reactivity of the
              biogeochemically significant carbonate reservoir.  However, the fundamental
              mechanistic interactions of Mg2+ with calcite surfaces remain controversial. 
              For this reason, the PI will use an experimental approach that integrates
              techniques from aqueous geochemistry and surface sciences to quantify the
              kinetic and thermodynamic controls on Mg and Sr contents of calcite grown in
              0.1 M NaCl and synthetic seawater solutions.  The PI also will determine the
              mechanism(s) by which Mg and Sr modify calcite growth properties and morphology
              and construct a quantitative and mechanistic model of calcite growth that
              provides a baseline for understanding the complexity of the influences of
              biological processes on the elemental composition of carbonate minerals.  
              Results from this research will provide a baseline for understanding the
              influence of trace elements incorporated into calcite.  This information is
              needed to interpret the compositions of biogenic calcite and in understanding
              paleotemperature data.
