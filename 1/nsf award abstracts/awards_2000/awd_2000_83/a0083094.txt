Abstract    :
               

As semiconductor technology strives for higher circuit densities, higher
              bandwidths, and lower power requirements, circuit elements have a higher
              susceptibility to ionizing radiation.  Since the discovery that spallation
              neutrons from cosmic rays and alpha particles from chip packaging materials
              produce electronic upsets, extensive design efforts have been undertaken to
              make electronic devices less sensitive to ionizing radiation.  Immunity to
              "soft errors" or Single Event Upsets (SEU) is listed as a requirement in the
              1997 National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors prepared by the
              Semiconductor Industry Association in the U.S.
	The aim of this research
              project is to undertake extensive experimental, theoretical modeling, and
              computer simulation studies of the physical processes underlying Single Event
              Upset (SEU) phenomena in prototype advanced IC devices.  All of the pieces are
              in place at the University of North Texas (UNT) to accomplish the proposed
              research including (1) the completion of the focused, scanning, heavy-ion
              microprobe, (2) establishment of an extensive user's facility, and (3)
              identification of an industrial partner  that has made a commitment to the
              charge diffusion and collection measurements and simulation research.
