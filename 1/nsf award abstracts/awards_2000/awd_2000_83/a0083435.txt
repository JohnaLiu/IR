Abstract    :
              In this project, a mobile gas analyzer for the detection of NO, NO2, and
              aromatic hydrocarbons at the ultra trace (ppt) level will be developed. The
              instrument is based on resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization time of flight
              mass spectrometry (REMPI/MS) and will feature highly selective real-time
              detection, direct sampling of air at ambient pressure, and a temporal
              resolution shorter than one second. Solid state laser technology and fiber
              optics will be used, making the instrument rugged and mobile.
