Abstract    :
              Partial support is provided for a meeting to be held at the Institute for
              Theoretical Physics during May 2000.  The focus of the workshop is on
              evaluating the prospects for advancements in the field of astrophysical
              turbulence.  The talks are organized along several parallel themes:
1.
              Observational properties of astrophysical turbulence, from the Solar atmosphere
              to the interstellar environment.
2. Physics of turbulent processes, with
              special emphasis on nuclear burning fronts, magnetic reconnection, thermal
              conduction and radiative fluids.
3. Techniques for numerical modeling of
              turbulent flows.
4. Transport of angular momentum via turbulent flows.
5.
              Instabilities and boundary layer effects in turbulent flow regimes.
6.
              Magnetic dynamos

Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program
              for Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
