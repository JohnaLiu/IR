Suburbanization, the conversion of native forest, range and
              farmland to infrastructure intensive, ecologically simplified landscapes, is
              currently consuming enormous amounts of land, with generally negative impacts
              on biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. The process, however, creates a
              complex feed back system that results in rapid and significant increases in
              stress on human social and economic systems. This Biocomplexity incubation
              award will allow this group to (1) develop mechanisms to facilitate
              communication between collaborative disciplines by defining key variables and
              parameters, and critical linkages among natural and social forcing functions,
              (2) identify existing data and resources, and (3) explore possible modeling,
              model analysis and interpretive approaches to link the dynamics of social and
              natural systems in response to suburbanization
