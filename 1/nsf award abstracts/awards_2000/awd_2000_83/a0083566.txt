Biological systems, from ecosystems to the biosphere, support
              our continued existence on the planet.  From them we derive food and fiber,
              fuel and pharmaceuticals.  Ecosystems mediate local and regional climates,
              stabilize soils, purify water and in general provide a nearly endless list of
              services essential to life as we know it.  The case for the preservation of
              ecosystems and these services is manifestly clear; the essential challenges are
              in the details of how to do it.  The key is in understanding biocomplexity -
              how it arises, how it is maintained, and how it sustains the services we derive
              from it.
 
This project will examine the mechanisms sustaining crucial
              regional and global processes that underlie our life-support systems.  The
              research approach will combine empirical and theoretical work, documenting
              emergent laws of organization, and examining through sophisticated modeling the
              mechanisms that generate and maintain biocomplexity and predictable
