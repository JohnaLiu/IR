Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to investigate the effects of culture conditions on
              recombinant protein production, specifically the effects of cell adhesion on
              yield and glycosylation patterns of recombinant proteins produced in Chinese
              hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The specific goals for the POWRE project are: (1) to
              develop expertise in the techniques for studying protein glycosylation
              including high performance liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis; (2)
              to determine what probes and imaging techniques are best suited for studies of
              the cytoskeleton for suspension and adherent cultures of CHO cells; and (3) to
              obtain preliminary data analyzing the glycoforms of tissue plasminogen
              activator produced under the different culture conditions and determine which
              of the techniques for studying protein glycosylation will be best suited for
              future studies.
