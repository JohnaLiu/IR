Abstract    :
              This is a grant to support a workshop on Algorithmic Issues in Modeling Motion
              to be held at Duke during August 2000.

Representations of motion are central
              to all computational disciplines dealing with modeling the physical world. 
              This grant will support a direction-setting workshop on algorithmic issues in
              modeling motion.   About 20 research leaders from a variety of fields, such as
              computational geometry, computer graphics, robotics, spatial databases,
              molecular dynamics, and computer vision will participate.  Currently, each of
              these fields has its own methods for handling moving objects.   By bringing
              together these experts in different areas, unified approaches and new
              techniques for representing, processing, reasoning, analyzing, searching, and
              visualizing moving objects will be developed.  The workshop will produce a
              final report.
