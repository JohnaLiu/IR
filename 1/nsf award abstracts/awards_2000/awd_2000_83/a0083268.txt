Abstract    :
              0083268    McCartney/WHOI

A moored array will be deployed in the Vema
              Fracture Zone, a deep
channel between the Guiana Basin and the eastern N.
              Atlantic through 
which bottom water from the Antarctic eneters the eastern N.
              Atlantic.
The array of instruments will directly measure the transport and
              lateral 
structure of deep and bottom water flowing through the restricted
              
channel and indirectly measure the degree of mixing and its variability.
              
The instruments will stay in the water for roughly one year.  The moored
              
array will consist of four newly developed profiling moorings together
with
              two more traditional curren meter moorings.  Apart from the science
questions
              that are the focus of the experiment, a by-product will be a
comparison of new
              and traditional approaches to measuring abyssal 
circulation.
