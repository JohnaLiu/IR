Abstract    :
              Growing evidence indicates that activities associated with our increasingly
              urban-industrial society are causing global environment change and may not be
              sustainable.  One of the major impacts is the decline of many animal and plant
              species.  An interdisciplinary group of biologists and social scientists will
              work together to better understand how roads, disease, pollution, war, hunting,
              and other activities affect the long-term survival of endangered species. 
              Computer models and other research tools will be developed in a series of
              workshops to better understand and explain these relationships.  An important
              goal is to build an international network to encourage future research and
              application of these new tools and concepts. 
	
This project has national and
              international significance. To conserve the world's most threatened species it
              is necessary to understand how they can survive in landscapes dominated by
              people.  Historically, biologists studying plants and animals have not often
              worked closely with social scientists.  This project is a valuable opportunity
              for researchers from different disciplines to share their expertise and to
              develop tools that can be used to create effective and sustainable conservation
              strategies for endangered species in the United States and around the world.
