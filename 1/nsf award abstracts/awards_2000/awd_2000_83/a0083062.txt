The proposal
              is an extension of the PI's ongoing work, trying to establish the relationship
              between the bulk properties of metal oxides and the underlying processes which
              take place between their component nanoscale particles.  The latter are
              characterized by such thermophysical properties as surface tension, viscosity
              and diffusion coefficients.  The collision dynamics of such particles will be
              computed by classical molecular dynamics, and their properties chosen so that
              the calculated bulk (continuum) properties coincide with their corresponding
              experimental value.  In this manner, it is possible to predict the properties
              of metal oxides through reliable microscopic models, at ever decreasing sizes. 
              It is proposed in particular, to study silica clusters with 2- or 3 body
              potentials.  Similarly, it is planned to model the coalescence process (i.e.
              sintering) with an atomistic simulation of particle-particle impact.
