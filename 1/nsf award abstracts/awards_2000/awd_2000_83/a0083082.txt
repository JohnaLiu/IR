Abstract    :
              MB-System is a public domain UNIX package for the processing and display of
              swath mapping sonar data.  This project will continue the development and
              maintenance of the MB-System software package.  In addition, new and improved
              documentation will be developed, new functionality added, and new data formats
              supported.
