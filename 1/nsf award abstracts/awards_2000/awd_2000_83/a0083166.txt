Abstract    :
                 The Villafranchian is a European time interval based on the mammals
which
              lived from roughly 3.5-1.5 million years ago, an interval which saw
important
              events in human and faunal evolution. Although this concept was
first proposed
              nearly 150 years ago, there is still uncertainty as to the
timing of the unit
              and subunit boundaries. The PI's will attempt to clarify
the situation through
              reanalysis of one of the major late Villafranchian
mammalian localities, the
              volcanic explosion-crater lake (maar) of Seneze,
in central France. No major
              paleontological collection has been undertaken
at Seneze in 60 years, while
              stratigraphic and dating studies since 1960
have yielded conflicting results.
              Neither the precise location of
productive findspots nor who controls access
              to them is known, and there
may be more than one fossil-bearing horizon.  
  
                The team effort will involve three complementary approaches: 1) to
clarify
              the local geology of this complex site; 2) to utilize a combination
of dating
              methods on the site and its fauna; and 3) to collect mammalian
fossils from
              known points within the revised and dated stratigraphy. New
specimens of
              important mammals such as the terrestrial primate
Paradolichopithecus may
              result from this study. This application requests
funds for a one-week
              exploratory visit in June 2000. If that is successful,
a
              stratigraphic-geochronological season will be attempted in 2001,
              with
full-scale collecting of fossils planned for 2002 and 2003.
