Title:	Biocomplexity: Deeply understanding complex systems
              through relationship analysis

This project is an incubation activity aimed
              at seeding a multidisciplinary group in biocomplexity research.  Through
              preliminary collaborative work, this group has developed an approach for
              analyzing complex relationships in natural (biological and others)
              environments, in a way similar to those for analyzing complex computing and
              information systems.  The goals of this project are to better understanding of
              this new approach and to test its extensibility from a single domain to
              multiple domains.  The project will support the interaction and collaboration
              among several faculty members, graduate students across several institutions. 
              A center piece of the project is the holding of two workshops that bring
              together researchers from various disciplines within the biological, physical,
              and social sciences.  The outcomes of this work will contribute significantly
              to the enhancement of the project team for future research and education in
              biocomplexity.
