ITR:  High
              Density Analog Computing Arrays

This project is investigating an alternate
              model of real-time sensory signal processing based upon a mixture of analog and
              digital computation.  The arrays under study perform analog computations
              directly in modified EEPROM memory cells;  each cell acts as a multiplier that
              multiplies the input signal by an analog value stored on a floating gate. 
              Potential advantages of analog computing arrays include lower latency than
              digital computers, lower power consumption, and parallel processing of many
              analog inputs.  The project encompasses experimental demonstration of analog
              computing arrays, simulation and design tools to make the technology accessable
              to DSP designers, and investigation of the robustness and reliability of the
              technology.  Several single-chip signal processing systems will be developed,
              including adaptive matched filters, a cepstrum calculater, systems for hidden
              Markov models, and a multi-directional filter array.
