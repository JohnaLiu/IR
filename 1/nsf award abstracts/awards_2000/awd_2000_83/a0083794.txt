Abstract    :
              Recommended project is for three years of continued funding of research on
              coupled phase equilibria and trace element partitioning between mantle phases
              and melt at temperatures, pressures and compositions which closely approximate
              those which exist under mid-ocean ridges during partial mantle melting and
              mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) genesis.  This work will build upon previous
              results that determined mineral-melt partitioning at for lherzolite mantle
              compositions at pressures between 1.2 and 3.4 Gpa.  Crystal liquid partition
              coefficients will be determined for the rare earth elements (REE), Hf, Zr, Nb,
              U, Th, and Ba using an ion microprobe.  Analytical charges will be prepared
              that are as close as possible to the peridotite solidus to most closely
              approximate conditions of partial mantle melting.  In this work peridotite
              experimental charges formed at pressures up to 5.0 Gpa will be examined,
              including new studies at lower pressures.  Pyroxenite charges representing
              pressures of 1.0-3.0 Gpa will also be analyzed, to form critical datasets that
              will allow the testing of models hypothesizing garnet pyroxenite (or eclogite)
              in the source of both MORB and plume melts.  Depleted peridotite (harzburgite)
              charges will also be analyzed.  These new data will be incorporated into new
              integrated models of mantle melting that integrate both major and trace element
              compositions.
