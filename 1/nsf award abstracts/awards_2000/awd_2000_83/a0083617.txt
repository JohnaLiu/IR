Recent developments in community ecology reflect a shift from
              equilibrium, niche-based concepts to a more expansive view that incorporates
              species interactions, non-equilibrium dynamics, migration, and evolutionary
              history.  This creates a much more complex perspective of the forces
              determining patterns of species abundance and distribution in communities:
              dealing with the complexity itself has become a major hurdle in conceptual and
              experimental community ecology.  This project is designed to organize a group
              of ecologists, evolutionary biologists, mathematical modelers, and systematists
              to conduct a comparative observational and experimental study of the metazoan
              community inhabiting leaves of the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea.  This
              community is remarkably consistent and widespread across North America and
              provides a model microcosm for experimental studies.  Project activities will
              bring together a working group of scientists to plan a set of coordinated field
              studies to investigate this community, to collect pilot data from these
              studies, to develop macroecological hypotheses that can be tested with these
              data, and to formalize models of community structure based on these data.  The
              long-term goal is the development and execution of a comprehensive set of field
              experiments and phylogenetic studies of ecological and evolutionary
              determinants of community structure from local to continental scales.
