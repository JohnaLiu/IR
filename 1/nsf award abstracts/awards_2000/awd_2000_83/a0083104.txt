Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF) are thought to increase
              the generation of neurons in the Central Nervous System. These factors elicit
              their effect by binding to FGF receptors on the surface of neural progenitor
              cells. The function of each of the four existing FGF receptors during normal
              brain development is unclear. This Project investigates whether FGF receptor 1
              (FGFR-1) controls the growth of the mammalian brain. To study the function of
              FGFR-1 in brain development, mice will be generated that lack the FGFR-1 gene
              only in the brain. These mice are produced by targeting a DNA recombinase
              called Cre to cells of the developing brain. The Cre recombinase will excise
              critical segments of the FGFR-1 gene in these cells. The resulting
              brain-specific FGFR-1 mutants will be studied to elucidate the role of FGFR-1
              in cell proliferation and fate. 
Cognitive functions strongly correlate with
              an increase in the relative size and complexity of the brain. Studying the
              basic mechanisms that construct the brain during early development may shed
              light on the underlying basis for cognitive functions. In addition, because
              neural progenitor cells persist in the adult mammalian brain and may continue
              to use FGF-regulated mechanisms, this research may help understand the role of
              this receptor in brain cell renewal and repair.
