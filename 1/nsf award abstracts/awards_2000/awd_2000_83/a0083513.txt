This incubation activity will lead to the development of a new
              biocomplexity research program. The purpose of this research program is to
              improve the understanding of the extent to which forest ecosystems can be
              managed to maximize the uptake and storage of carbon dioxide from the
              atmosphere. The long term goal is to determine if the uptake and storage of
              carbon dioxide in forests can significantly reduce the rising levels of carbon
              dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere. This multi-institutional research program
              will be built upon six existing forest carbon dioxide research programs of the
              AmeriFlux network. The six programs are located at: Harvard University, Indiana
              University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, University of Michigan, University
              of Minnesota, and Yale University. A seventh institution, The Ecosystems Center
              at Woods Hole, will participate and provide
