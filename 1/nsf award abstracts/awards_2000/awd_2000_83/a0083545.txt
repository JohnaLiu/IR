Biocomplexity: Divergent dynamics: Complex
              interactions of riparian land, people and lakes

Surprises -large, unexpected
              changes from apparently small causes -are common in systems of people and
              nature.  Are these surprises a consequence of the complexity or nonlinearity of
              natural-social systems?  Or can they be explained by simpler processes?  This
              research project addresses this question for systems composed of lakes, their
              riparian vegetation and land use, and social and economic organizations of lake
              users.  The investigators will study the self-organization of lake users and
              associated characteristics of shoreline and lake ecosystems.  The project will
              determine whether thresholds in riparian organization set the stage for an
              important class of surprises:  collapses of economically important game fish
              stocks.  The researchers will also test the possibility that nonlinear dynamics
              can be used to design manipulations that remove invading crayfish from a lake. 
              If successful, this experiment will catalyze a self-sustaining removal of an
              invasive species - a path-breaking ecological restoration.
