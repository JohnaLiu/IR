Abstract    :
              This project is for partial support of the technical program of the US Panel on
              Wind and Seismic Effects during the period from March 15, 2001 through
              September 30, 2001.  This project is co-shared by several other Government
              Agencies.  The National Institute for Science Technology (NIST) will be the
              coordinator for the US Panel of members.  NIST will develop and manage the
              technical program, prepare and distribute reports and proceedings to the US
              members, Agencies, and Japanese counterparts, plan and develop strategies
              shared by the US members.  Through the task committees specific issues will be
              discussed at the meeting.  Issues are: Earthquake hazard reduction, control
              systems, repair and retrofit of structures and wind effects on structures.
