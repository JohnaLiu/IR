Abstract    :
              The PI will pursue research in areas of algebraic geometry,
commutative
              algebra, combinatorics, and their computational aspects,
with emphasis on
              syzygies and their relevance to geometry.  The PI will
study (1) Syzygies of
              Lawrence toric ideals and their relation to
chromatic numbers of graphs, (2)
              Syzygies, the rank variety and the
complexity of Orlik-Solomon algebras, (3)
              Syzygies of symmetric
sheaves, and corresponding obstruction classes in
              derived Witt groups
to the existence of symmetric locally free resolutions of
              such
sheaves, (4) Natural compactifications of configurations of
points in
              projective space and their applications to enumerative
problems.

 Algebraic
              geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but
one which has
              had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. 
The main thrust is
              towards discovering connections 
between the geometry of sets defined by the
              vanishing of
polynomials and the algebraic invariants derived from the
              defining
equations of these sets, for instance syzygies.  Results in
              algebraic
geometry and combinatorics have also found uses in communications,
              
security and robotics.
