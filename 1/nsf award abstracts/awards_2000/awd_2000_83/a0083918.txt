              ABSTRACT

OCE-0083918


For over two decades the Carbon Dioxide Research
              Group at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography has been collecting seawater
              samples with the goal of assaying dissolved inorganic carbon in seawater as a
              means of detecting and understanding long-term changes associated with rising
              atmospheric carbon dioxide.  In this project in an effort to continue and
              update this work, the Scripps investigators will (1) re-evaluate  the
              calibrations of the manometric instrumental measurement systems utilized by the
              Group, (2) complete dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, and 13C/12C
              isotopic analyses of stored samples backlogged over the  years, and (3) adjust
              any past seawater-carbon dioxide Certified Reference Materials and data based
              on the new manometer calibration.   Continued operation of the manometric
              measurement facility is of  great importance to ocean and global carbon cycle
              research.
