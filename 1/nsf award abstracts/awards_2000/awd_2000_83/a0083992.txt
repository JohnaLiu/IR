Projecting change in land use and land cover is often more art
              than science.  This project will explore the intersection of social systems,
              land use, land cover, and the physical environment.  The goal is to better
              understand how human behavior, policy choices, and economic forces affect land
              use, how land use relates to land cover, and how social and ecological systems
              interact in the context of changing landscapes in the Great Lakes region.  The
              approach to exploring this complexity involves: forming interdisciplinary
              working groups; conducting pilot studies to help define and characterize
              drivers of landscape change; assessing existing spatial models that link social
              and biological processes; and formulating conceptual models that express
              relationships between social and biological systems.
