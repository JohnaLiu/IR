Our goal is to search for generalities and common processes,
              or "laws", that govern the co-evolution of biodiversity and the environment
              over geological time scales.  Given that available time series are inadequate
              for our purposes, we will continue to develop our paleontological and
              geochemical databases.  The paleontological database will document the
              occurrences of macroscopic organisms throughout the Phanerozoic (the last 543
              million years), and will include geographic, stratigraphic, paleoenvironmental,
              phylogenetic, body mass, and trophic relationship data.  The geochemical
              database will include the record of the isotopic compositions of organic and
              inorganic carbon from the rock record.  Using these databases we will conduct a
              series of analyses to characterize the intrinsic dynamic properties of the
              evolution of the biosphere.  Further, the paleontological and environmental
              data will be dissected regionally to determine the extent to which intrinsic
              and extrinsic factors mediate local diversity changes.
