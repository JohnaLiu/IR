Restoration ecologists have often generally discussed the
              importance of landscape-level processes, such as flooding and animal movement,
              in determining restoration success, but have rarely used understanding of basic
              ecological processes to provide land managers with tools to prioritize
              restoration efforts. This research comprises an initial assessment of
              population, community, and ecosystem processes that regulate the dynamics of
              riparian forest ecosystem recovery along the Sacramento River, the largest
              river in California.  Incubation activities will include two parts.  First,
              existing data will be used to model linkages between hydrology, riparian
              vegetation, and riparian bird communities.  This model will be used to assess
              the importance of processes at different scales and to prioritize areas for
              future research.  Second, two meetings will be held with additional scientists
              who have experience modeling linkages between hydrology and ecological
              succession and/or have expertise in other areas that would be important in
              linking riparian restoration efforts and ecosystem dynamics, such as fish
              ecology, nutrient cycling and socioeconomic analysis.  This research will: (1)
              address fundamental questions of the scales at which ecosystem dynamics are
              regulated, (2) help to prioritize future experimental and modeling efforts, and
              (3) provide guidance to land managers on prioritizing restoration
              strategies.
