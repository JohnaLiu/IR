TITLE:  ITR: Quality Software by
              Design

ABSTRACT
Quality has always been a concern with respect to software.
              Yet now, with such great reliance on software in every aspect of our lives,
              there is even greater need to address quality in software development. High
              quality software means software whose specifications meet customers'
              requirements and whose implementations meet specifications.  The focus of this
              proposal is helping software developers design quality into their systems,
              which is far more cost-effective than relying solely on post-implementation
              quality evaluation and corrective maintenance. In particular, the proposed
              research encompasses a plan for combining for the first time (1) formal
              architecture and component design models, (2) analysis and testing techniques
              based on these formalisms, together with (3) cognitive-based, design
              environments for critiquing software design. The proposed research explores
              innovative user interface approaches to delivering critical design-related
              quality assessment information to software developers as they interactively
              develop designs. The information to be delivered is based on design heuristics,
              formal analysis and testing, and usage data and feedback. Information is to be
              delivered in a manner consistent with research in human cognition. Finally, to
              ensure that this research has the potential to impact real work, the formal
              architecture and component design models leverage and extend industry
              standards.
