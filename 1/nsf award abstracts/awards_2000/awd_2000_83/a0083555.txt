Funding is requested for a Fourier-Transform Infrared
              (FTIR) microscope-spectrometer system to serve the needs of investigators in
              the Departments of Archeology, Chemistry and Earth Sciences at Boston
              University. This instrument will be used to obtain complete spectra on very
              small (ca. 100-microgram) samples and to analyze very small (>_10-micron)
              features in macroscopic samples.

Specific applications of the FTIR
              microspectrometer will include the analysis of polymer-embedded sediments
              (e.g., from caves) for evidence of prehistoric human occupation, of paint
              pigments and binding materials from paintings, of archeological objects
              currently being uncovered at sites in China; and the detection of volatile
              substances (HZO and CO') trapped under high pressure in volcanic rocks, in
              order to better understand the explosivity and other properties of magma in
              volcanoes. Geological and paint pigment applications exploit existing
              techniques; the archeological applications are novel.

The FTIR
              microspectrometer is a robust instrument which can be used by faculty and
              students alike and therefore will have a significant impact on both our
              research and training programs. It will promote new areas research and
              strengthen developing core programs in archeology and materials analysis at
              Boston University, besides contributing to the understanding of prehistoric
              human behavior, the documentation and conservation of human cultural
              artifacts.
