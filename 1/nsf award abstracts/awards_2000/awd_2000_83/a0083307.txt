Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Society symposium on   Non-Lithographic & Lithographic
              Methods  for Nanofabrication: from ULSI to Photonics to Molecular Electronics
              will address the materials science, chemistry, physics, and biology of micro-
              and nanoscale structures including potential applications areas. In addition to
              the materials science and physics of these nanoscale systems, the symposium
              will  include a discussion of techniques such as self-assembly and lithographic
              methods as fabrication tools for building structures with micron and nanometer
              feature sizes,  and novel and emerging devices that rely on structures with
              submicron dimensions.

Nanostructured materials often display chemical
              and physical properties distinctly different from their corresponding bulk
              materials. Nanotechnology areas such as electronic, photonic and catalytic
              materials nanostructures exhibiting  novel properties for various applications
              are currently viewed as high priorities within industry. Preference for NSF 
              support to participate in this symposium will be given to students,  postdocs,
              and faculty who are early in their careers who may otherwise find it difficult
              to to travel to this conference.
