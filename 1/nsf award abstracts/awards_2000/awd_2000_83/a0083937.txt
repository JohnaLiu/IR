Recognizing and solving environmental problems are becoming
              major research priorities in the United States and across the world.  Solving
              environmental problems involves understanding how human activities interact
              with complicated natural environments, including impacts dealing with climate,
              oceans, lakes and streams, and watersheds.  Natural environments can be
              extremely dynamic over periods of years to centuries and such natural
              variability can complicate our understanding of environmental changes triggered
              by humans.  The proposed research aims to develop a new scientific method for
              integrating across a range of scientific disciplines in the study of
              environmental problems dealing with streams and rivers.  The research will
              develop quantitative tools that explicitly account for natural dynamics of
              environmental systems, and how human activities alter those dynamics in space
              and over time.  The new approach will include the use of computer simulation
              models and new parameters that describe the full suite of watershed attributes
              and how those attributes change over time due to natural processes and human
              activities.
