Abstract    :
              Surfaces abound in advanced scientific analysis and computing. The basic
              geometry of virtual environments, the isosurfaces of volume data, and the
              subdivision surfaces of synthetic environments are some examples. Effective
              utilization and data management of surfaces requires the ability to query
              archives of surfaces to look for particular surface shapes and features.
              Central to this capability is an efficient means to measure the distance
              between two surfaces. The objective comparison of algorithms that produce
              surfaces requires a similar precise and quantitative measure of the surfaces
              with each other or with an ideal. This project will develop a new methodology
              for computing the distance between two surfaces. It will also develop efficient
              basic techniques and algorithms that will bring this technology into everyday
              use in areas of searching databases of surfaces and comparing algorithms on
              surfaces.
