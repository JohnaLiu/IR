Abstract    :
              This CONACyT research project will enable a research group at the University of
              South Carolina to cooperate with a research group at the Instituto Politecnico
              Nacional in Mexico City, Mexico. Together they will develop a methodology that
              enables software agents with different ontologies to interact and exchange
              information. The objectives are to increase the ease with which such software
              can be produced and its robustness. Under this approach, software development
              would consist of choosing among "volunteers" (agents from an active repository)
              and assembling them into a problem-solving team, instead of debugging lines of
              code. Software development would be more like coaching and less like
              traditional programming. The research will explore 1) how independently
              constructed autonomous agents reach mutual understanding, 2) what categories of
              software are suitable for team-oriented programming, and 3) how team behaviors
              can be analyzed and validated. Groups of students will assemble agent-based
              software systems and compare the resulting systems for robustness with software
              developed conventionally. The two resarch sites will collaborate through online
              meetings, the exchange of graduate students and mutual visits to each other's
              research centers.
