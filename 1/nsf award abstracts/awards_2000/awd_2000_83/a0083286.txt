Friction, lubrication and adhesion are fundamental processes
              with many technological applications.  Traditional engineering approaches to
              these phenomena start from macroscopic continuum equations that rely on
              phenomenological inputs.  The goal of this research is to improve our
              understanding of how molecular level processes control macroscopic properties
              and how behavior changes as dimensions approach the atomic scale.  The primary
              tool will be molecular dynamics simulations, coupled to continuum theory at
              large scales.
