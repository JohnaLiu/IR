Abstract    :
              The specific resistance of ohmic contacts to n- and p-type GaN, AlGaN, and
              
GaInN are very important for many device properties such as power
              
efficiency, amplification, noise, device heating, and reliability. In this
              
work, a fundamentally novel approach to low-resistance ohmic contacts to
              
AlGaN, GaInN, and GaN will be developed and investigated. The contacts are
              
based on the employment of the strong spontaneous and piezoelectric
              
polarization fields occurring in GaN and related compounds. The polarization
              
fields in the near-surface layers of metal-semiconductor contacts will
              
enhance the tunneling probability of carriers thereby reducing the ohmic
              
contact specific resistance. The theory and modeling pertaining to tunneling
              
probability, contact formation, and specific contact resistance will be
              
developed. Polarization-enhanced contacts will be demonstrated and reduced
              
contact resistances will be verified. In addition, the role of polarization
              
fields in AlGaN-GaN superlattices will be investigated and the superlattices
              
will be optimized for ohmic contact applications.
     An integral part of
              the work will be the incorporation of the 
polarization-enhanced ohmic
              contacts in optoelectronic and electronic 
devices. Light-emitting diodes
              (LEDs), in particular LEDs used for 
high-power illumination applications, are
              in need of low resistance ohmic 
contacts in order to reduce device heating
              and improve device efficiency and 
reliability. GaN/GaInN LEDs with
              polarization-enhanced ohmic contacts will 
be demonstrated.
              Polarization-enhanced ohmic contacts will also be realized 
in lasers and
              transistors and improved properties of these devices will be
              
demonstrated.
