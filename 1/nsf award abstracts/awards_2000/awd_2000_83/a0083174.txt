The Colloquium "Links between Recombination and
              Replication: Vital Roles of Recombination" will be held from Nov. 10-12, 2000,
              at the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center in Irvine, California. Attendees will
              include geneticists, biochemists, physical chemists, and molecular biologists.
              Recent examples in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided
              increasing evidence that links between recombination and replication are
              widespread. It is now clear that replication forks frequently stall or break,
              and that recombination enzymes forestall cell death by rescuing those forks.
              These findings have important implications for biology, medicine, industry and
              agriculture. A full understanding of the functions of recombination in the
              repair of damage to DNA will provide further insights into cell division, the
              multifarious response to DNA damage, and the mechanisms that limit
              carcinogenesis. Clues may be found as well for the biotechnology of gene
              targeting. In bacteria, the repair of collapsed replication forks has a
              dramatic impact on viability, the further study of which may suggest new
              targets for therapy directed at bacterial infections. The goal of the
              Colloquium is to stimulate further research on the connections between DNA
              recombination and replication, and to increase awareness of this developing
              area among colleagues and students throughout the biomedical community. Toward
              the achievement of that goal, an entire issue of the Proceedings of the
              National Academy of Sciences will be devoted to research reports emanating from
              the Colloquium.
