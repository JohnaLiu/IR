Recommended project is for acquisition and instrumentation
              costs for two Advanced Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kits (A-CORKs) that will
              be installed on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 196.  These will be used for
              sustained observations of subsurface fluid pressures in three stratigraphic
              regions of the Nankai Trough subduction zone- the oceanic basement of the
              subducting plate, the decollement between the accretionary wedge and the
              subducting crust, and in major faults within the accretionary wedge.  The
              advanced CORKs use multiple packer strings to independently seal off several
              regions of the borehole, in contrast to the original CORK design that
              integrated fluid pressure measurements over the entire borehole length.  The
              A-CORKs will also allow for eventual sampling of in-situ fluids.  This proposal
              is part of a larger, multi-national effort that includes Canadian and ODP
              resources in designing and fabricating the A-CORKs, installation of the A-CORKs
              and associated, Japanese-funded instrument strings by the ODP JOIDES Resolution
              drillship, and related logging-while-drilling (LWD) occurring in conjunction on
              the same cruise. Ship and submersible operations for follow-up data recovery
              and instrument servicing will be funded by the Japanese technology agency
              JAMSTEC.
