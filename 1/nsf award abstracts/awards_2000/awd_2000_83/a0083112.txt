This research project focuses on the development of metrics for
              comparing various evolutionary multiobjective optimization methods that may be
              applied to the design of environmental systems, as part of a larger study for
              developing decision-making tools for environmental remediation.  The main
              objective of this project is to advance the knowledge on evolutionary
              multiobjective optimization by (a) assessing the most common metrics currently
              in use, (b) developing new metrics, (c) conducting a comprehensive study of
              metrics in a real-world application and (d) conducting a sensitivity analysis
              of the existing and newly proposed metrics. The research developed as part of
              this project will make contributions to both computer science and operations
              research in the areas of evolutionary algorithms and multiobjective
              optimization, and will have important implications in decision making for
              environmental remediation.  This project involves collaboration of the PI with
              Dr. Carlos Coello at the National Laboratory for Advanced Informatics (LANIA,
              Xalapa, Mexico) and Dr. Carlos Mariano at the Mexican Institute for Water
              Technology (IMTA, Cuernavaca, Mexico).  The collaboration will take the form of
              communication via internet, biannual meetings of the investigators and the
              exchange of graduate students. This project will lay the groundwork for a
              long-term collaboration between Michigan Technological University, LANIA and
              IMTA. ***
