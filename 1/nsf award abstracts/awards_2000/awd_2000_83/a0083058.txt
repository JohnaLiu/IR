0083058

A magnitude 7.2 earthquake occurred on November 12, 1999 in
              the area of Duzce-Bolu, Turkey, 70 km east of Adapazari and 170 km northwest of
              Ankara, resulting in extensive damage, injuries and loss of life.  This
              earthquake occurred along the North Anatolian fault, a strike slip fault that
              has many similarities to the San Andreas fault in California.

This action
              provides partial support for a reconnaissance team that was dispatched shortly
              after the earthquake to document the geotechnical, engineering
              geology/seismology, and tsunamigenic features of this earthquake in as much
              detail as possible.  This team coordinated with other reconnaissance teams from
              Turkey, Japan and the United States.

As with all post-earthquake
              reconnaissance investigations, it is expected that vital records and data will
              become available as a result of this earthquake in Turkey.  From a scientific
              viewpoint, these large earthquakes act as full-scale experiments that cannot be
              duplicated via controlled experiments in the laboratory or in the field.  It is
              through quick response reconnaissance efforts that the mostly-ephemeral data
              from these events can be recovered and used to further advances in earthquake
              hazard mitigation.  The results from this investigation are expected to yield
              information and data that will help the profession to understand the effects of
              large-scale strike slip fault systems on urbanized and industrial
              areas.

This is a multi-institutional award involving the University of
              California at Berkeley and the University of Southern California.
