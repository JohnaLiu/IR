This grant for Research at an Undergraduate Institution
              (RUI) provides support for theoretical research on the statistical mechanics of
              directed polymers in random media (DPRM) and domain-walls in impurity-stricken
              magnets.  Because of common technical aspects, the DPRM has been christened a
              baby-version of the spin-glass problem.  As such, the T=0 DPRM is a matter of
              global optimization, exhibiting an ultrametric tree structure reminiscent of
              those found in river delta basins, capillary blood vessel networks, and
              neuronal arrays in the brain.  A Hopf-Cole transformation maps the DPRM to the
              far-from-equilibrium dynamics of  Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) stochastic growth
              models.  A final payoff follows from the blood relation of KPZ and noisy
              Burgers equations, the latter relevant to nonequilibrium kinetics of driven
              lattice gases.  An important goal at hand is further exploration of this rich
              KPZ triumvirate: DPRM, kinetic roughening, and driven lattice gases.  With the
              DPRM becoming a classic problem of ill-condensed matter, however, future
              research will focus on diverse, general issues concerning geometric complexity,
              including scaling of extremal trajectories and networks in geomorphology,
              evolutionary biology, and other multidisciplinary statistical mechanics
              contexts.

              to their intrinsic fundamental interest.  The research involves extensive
              undergraduate participation.
