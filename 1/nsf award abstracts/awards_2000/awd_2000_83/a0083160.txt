Abstract    :
              The long term goal of this research is to explore the molecular mechanisms that
              bacteria use for inter-cellular communication. This proposal focuses on a study
              of quorum sensing in the model bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi.
              V. harveyi has two quorum sensing circuits (Signalling System 1 and Signaling
              System 2) that converge to regulate light production (Lux). Each system is made
              up of a two-component sensor-autoinducer pair; LuxN/AI-1 for System 1 and
              LuxQ/AI-2 for System 2. Both sensors transduce information to a shared
              phosphorelay protein called LuxU, which in turn conveys the signal to the
              response regulator protein LuxO. Phospho-LuxO is indirectly responsible for
              repression of luciferase production at low cell density, because it activates
              the expression of a negative regulator of Lux. A transcriptional activator
              protein called LuxR is also required for expression of the luciferase
              structural operon. Results suggest that V. harveyi uses Signaling System 1 and
              AI-1 for intra-species communication and Signaling System 2 and AI-2 for
              inter-species communication. LuxO and RpoN are required for the repression of
              the expression of luminescence at low cell density. The hypothesis that both of
              these proteins are required for the activation of a repressor X at low cell
              density will be tested by isolating and characterizing mutations in the
              putative repressor gene.
