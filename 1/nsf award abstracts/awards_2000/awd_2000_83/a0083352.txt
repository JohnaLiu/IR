This award supports a National Science Foundation Dissertation
              Enhancement award to Dr. Kyungsik Kang of Brown University, Providence.  Dr.
              Kang's student, Mr.David C. Dooling will conduct his Ph. D. dissertation
              research on investigations in flavor physics. 

Mr. Dooling requests fund to
              travel to South Korea and per diem for carrying out his Ph.D. dissertation work
              at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) for 12 months, while his
              thesis advisor Prof. Kang visits KIAS on a sabbatical.  The research project
              concerns one of the major unsolved mysteries of particle physics, that of
              fermion masses and flavor mixing. The proposed research to be conducted at KIAS
              also concerns the experimental mysteries of the fermion masses and mixings. 
              Mr. Dooling wishes to investigate simultaneous explanations of the quark and
              lepton sectors, as well as to take into account the possible role of gravity in
              explaining the observed values of these parameters.
