Abstract:
Recently, systems and fields ranging
              from physics to Meteorology, from chemistry to biology, and even from
              psychology to economics and political science have been recognized as having
              common features which identify them as complex systems.  Complex systems have
              structure and behavior on multiple scales of time and space.  However, complex
              systems methods are lacking a formal multiscale methodology,.  This project of
              formalizing multiscale descriptions of complex systems is a stage in the
              development of a unifying approach, which will be useful to solve important
              problems.  In this incubation activity the researchers will develop
              collaborations and core research that will enable implementing this formalism
              for problems of hurricane prediction, the sign of robust computer networks, and
              the analysis of high throughput data generation in biology.

This incubation
              activity will lay the groundwork for this generally useful methodology to be
              pursued by a community that includes selected members of the faculty of
              Brandeis University, Boston University, Harvard University, MIT, Tufts
              University, University of Massachusetts, Yale University, and other academic
              institutions.  Interdisciplinary supervision will be integrated through a core
              program developing the multiscale methodologies.
