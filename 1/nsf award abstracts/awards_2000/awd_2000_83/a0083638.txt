Abstract    :
              The grant address the evolution of so-called "infinite-dimensional" traits in
              natural populations.  Many highly complex traits, such as morphological shapes,
              developmental trajectories, and phenotypic responses to continuous
              environmental variables (like temperature, photoperiod, or rainfall) are
              "infinite-dimensional" because their complete description would require, in
              general, an infinite number of measurements.  The project will involve the
              joint development of specialized mathematical models, identification of
              critical statistical issues and methods (including experimental design,
              parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and prediction), and evaluation of
              field and laboratory empirical approaches that can be used to study
              infinite-dimensional trait evolution in natural systems.

Understanding the
              evolution of highly complex (i.e., infinite-dimensional) traits is one of the
              most important and challenging problems in biology.  Although holistic
              quantitative approaches to study infinite-dimensional trait evolution were
              first proposed over a decade ago, current methods lack many developments
              required for practical implementation in empirical studies of natural
              populations.  These incubation activities will enable development of a research
              proposal that would, when implemented, provide practical and powerful
              quantitative tools and empirical systems for investigations of complex trait
              evolution.
