Abstract    :
              This grant will be used to pay student travel expenses to the annual conference
              of the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology (SBN) in August 2000.   The
              SBN fosters research and education concerning how hormones act on the brain and
              body to influence behavior.  SBN is unique in its attention to student members.
               For example, last year's annual SBN meeting drew136 student attendees, 85
              competitors in the student poster competition, and 42 competitors for the
              student travel awards.  Students typically have limited financial resources,
              and thus, we set membership dues at $10, and consistently provide affordable
              accommodations.  This year's annual meeting in Madrid, Spain will offer special
              opportunities to travel abroad and to interact with a diverse group of
              distinguished scientists. The momentum we generated in student participation
              might have been dampened by the prohibitive cost of transatlantic travel, had
              we not received this travel grant.
Research presented at the SBN conference
              has impact on clinical treatments as well as on environmental awareness.  For
              example, the hormonal changes of menopause and those associated with stressful
              experiences are associated with a loss of memory and learning ability.  Members
              of SBN are studying the effects of the ovarian hormone, estrogen, and adrenal
              hormones on the specific brain cells that influence learning and memory.  Other
              members of SBN are studying the effects of hormones secreted by plants such as
              soy.  Ingested plant hormones impair fertility or even reverse the sex of
              animals, including people.  These are just two of the many examples of hormonal
              effects on behavior that SBN members seek to understand.  While most of science
              reduces these phenomena to the cellular and molecular level, SBN members seeks
              to integrate cellular and molecular concepts into a functional framework that
              is relevant for the whole animal in its environment.
