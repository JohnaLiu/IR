Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania will
              acquire a X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule
              diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following: a) synthesis and chemical and bioactivity properties
              of metallatricarbaboranyl and isoelectronic metallaheteroatomboranyl complexes;
              b) control of radical polymerization of olefins by metalloradical and atom
              transfer mechanisms; c) transition metal complexes of organosilicon and
              -germanium compounds: new structures and catalysts; d) conjugated
              porphyrin-based assemblies for biomimetic energy transduction and catalysis;
              and e)elucidation of catalyst structure and function.

The X-ray
              diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
              dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
              it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
              relative to the neighboring molecules.  These studies will have an impact in a
              number of areas, including the preparation of more efficient catalysts,
              materials chemistry and biotechnology.
