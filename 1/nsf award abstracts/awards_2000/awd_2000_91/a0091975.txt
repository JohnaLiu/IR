Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska in
              Lincoln will acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
              researchers to carry out studies on a) novel ligands and complexes; b) polar
              hydrophobicity; c) asymmetric synthesis of alpha-vinyl amino acids; d)
              metal-catalyzed cyclizations; e) preparation and study of very high-spin
              organic polyradicals; f) mechanistic and synthetic studies on highly reactive
              metals; and g) characterization of bio-lanthanide contrast agents and
              polyproplyene microscruture.     

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry and biochemistry.
