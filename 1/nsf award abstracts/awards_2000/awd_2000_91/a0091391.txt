Abstract    :
              The ability to perceive and respond to the changing light environment is a
              fundamental feature of land plants.  Light affects many aspects of development
              of a young dicotyledonous seedling.  In Arabidopsis, de-etiolation is regulated
              by two types of photosensory receptors: the red/far-red light receptors
              phytochromes and blue/UV-A light receptors cryptochromes.  It is well known
              that cryptochromes and phytochromes, which are evolutionary unrelated, co-act
              to bring about the similar photomorphogenic responses.  Although the mechanism
              underlying the photoreceptor co-action is not known, it has been proposed that
              some photoreceptor signaling molecules might be involved in the action of both
              cryptochromes and phytochromes.  . Consistent with this hypothesis,  a novel
              photomorphogenic mutant, sub1 (short under blue light and far-red light), and 
              the SUB1 gene that encodes a calcium-binding protein has been isolated.  The
              current project is aimed to (1) characterize the cellular localization of SUB1
              and light-regulated expression of SUB1; (2) investigate the significance of the
              calcium-binding activity in the function of SUB1; and (3) characterize the
              additional sub loci for possible involvement of the corresponding genes in the
              cryptochrome/phytochrome co-action.  Completion of this research will improve
              understanding of the molecular mechanism of light-regulated plant
              development.
