Abstract    :
              Exclusive offspring care by females is the norm among mammals, but among a small
              set of species, males and other group members also play an important and
              potentially crucial role in the nurturing of dependent offspring.  Among
              marmosets and tamarins, primates of the New World, care by all group members,
              including the mother, father, and nonbreeding juveniles and subadults, is the
              norm for social groups.  Results from previous NSF funding have revealed
              important differences in levels of effort in infant care by mothers and
              fathers, with mothers playing a large role in infant care in the first two
              weeks of life, and fathers and helpers playing a central role in the 3rd and
              4th weeks of infant life and beyond.  These changes are associated with
              variations in testosterone (T) concentrations in mothers and fathers: T is
              reduced in mothers in the first 2 weeks post partum and in fathers during the
              second 2 weeks post partum, which corresponds to the highest rates of infant
              care.  The studies outlined in the current proposal will utilize both
              observational and experimental approaches to the possibility that variation in
              testosterone concentrations helps regulate responsiveness to infants in
              marmosets, and whether T mediates a trade-off in effort in infant care versus
              reproductive and/or aggressive behaviors, which may be incompatible with infant
              care.  The results will shed light on the possibility that complex affiliative
              and caregiving behaviors in social primates may, in part, be influenced by
              biological states, as well as experience-related factors.
