Abstract    :
              Professor Sylvia Ceyer and her colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology are investigating the detailed dynamics of the etching of silicon
              surfaces by XeF2 and F2 etchant molecules.  With the support of the Analytical
              and Surface Chemistry Program, this group is testing the hypothesis that large
              local lattice vibrational excitations on collision with the silicon surface
              lead to the enhanced reactivity of XeF2 etchant molecules, as compared to F2 or
              F etchants.  Comparisons of the molecular beam scattering of  XeF2 and van der
              Waals bound Xe(F2) complexes are made, and the details of the energy transfer
              and reaction process are mapped out.  These dynamic surface reactivity studies
              are designed to provide fundamental insights into the process of silicon
              etching.  

The effect of local lattice vibrational excitation on the
              reactivity of XeF2 for the etching of silicon is examined in this research
              project.  The enhanced reactivity of XeF2 compared to F2 may be related to the
              lattice excitation that results on collision of the massive XeF2 species with
              the silicon surface.  Direct comparison of the dynamics, using molecular beam
              scattering methods, allow Professor Ceyer and her group at MIT to probe this
              hypothesis.
