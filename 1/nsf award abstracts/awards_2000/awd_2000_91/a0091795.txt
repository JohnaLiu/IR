Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of South Alabama will
              acquire a Circular Dichroism Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research
              in a number of areas including a) CD spectroscopy of the solution structure of
              synthetic antifreeze polypeptides; b) conformational analysis of the
              heme-containing subunits of lumbricus hemoglobin; c) the role of sequence
              differences on the shape of the protein folding energy landscape; d) asymmetric
              catalysis; and e) exciton chirality investigations of isotopically substituted
              oligosaccharides.  

Circular dichroism spectroscopy is an extremely useful
              tool in modern analytical chemistry.  It provides a very reliable and sensitive
              method for assigning absolute molecular configurations.  The results from these
              studies will have a strong impact in biochemistry and other areas.
