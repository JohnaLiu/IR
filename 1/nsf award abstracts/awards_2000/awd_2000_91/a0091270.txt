Abstract    :
              Many genomes have already been sequenced and more will follow.  However, for
              many research questions, the most important information in a genome is its
              translation products, not simply the nucleic acid sequence.  Despite
              significant effort in experimental biology, high throughput sequencing, and
              bioinformatics, it is still difficult to answer the question, "What are the
              structures of all the genes and the amino acid sequences of the translation
              products?".  The work here will use orthologous genomic sequences to assist in
              annotating the genomic sequence of other organisms.  Specifically, the already
              assembled sequence of yeast, fruit fly, flat worm, and the first plant
              sequence, Arabidopsis, and orthologous  shotgun sequence or EST sequence to
              help in identifying new gene structures.  The system uses a probability model
              based on Hidden Markov Models and an optimization algorithm.  This is a
              generalization of a project for comparing assembled orthologous sequences.
