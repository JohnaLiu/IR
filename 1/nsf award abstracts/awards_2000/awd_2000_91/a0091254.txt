Virtually all cells are polarized and need to be in order to
              carry out their programmed functions.  The mechanisms by which cells acquire,
              maintain and elaborate polarity have been well conserved through evolution.  In
              general, cell polarization begins at the cell periphery when an asymmetric cue
              induces local remodeling of the actin fibers, generating an "actin patch." 
              Members of the Rho family of GTPases are recruited to these patches and
              activate secondary signaling molecules that propagate the cellular response by
              reorganizing the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, and polarizing the plasma
              membrane and intracellular membrane trafficking pathways.  There is a growing
              body of evidence that feedback loops are built into this basic pathway to
              reinforce and amplify the response.  For example, disruption of Rho activity in
              epithelial cells causes a loss of cell-cell contacts, implicating these GTPases
              in the maintenance of the same adhesion complexes that recruit and activate
              them in the first place.  The recent discovery that Rab11, a conserved member
              of the membrane recycling pathway, is required for microtubule organization and
              RNA localization in Drosophila oocytes would appear to reveal another such
              feedback loop.  Specifically, it is proposed that Rab11, in response to an
              asymmetric cue and Rho CTPase activation, polarizes the plasma membrane,
              thereby enhancing reception of the asymmetric cue, Rho GTPase activation and
              "downstream" polarization events, such as microtubule organization and RNA
              localization.  Here, a "candidate gene" approach is described that seeks to
              identify markers of Drosophila oocyte membrane polarity.  In particular, a
              number of adhesion molecules and other proteins that define polarity of other
              plasma membrance systems will be examined immunocytochemically for asymmetric
              distribution along the oocyte's plasma me
