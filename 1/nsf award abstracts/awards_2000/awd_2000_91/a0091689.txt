Abstract    :
              The objective of this work is to study chemical reactions in, and the physical
              barriers that microcapsules establish.  The PI's goal is to demonstrate the
              advantages and disadvantages of microencapsulation in photoprocesses.  Basic
              studies of the transport of reagents and intermediates from a microcapsule to
              the surrounding environment and vice versa, are proposed.  The experiments will
              prioritized as follows: Initially the research will polystyrene and onium
              salts.  The objective will be to encapsulate photoreactive compounds that
              produce catalysts and cause their decomposition in the capsule.  Experiments
              are proposed to follow reagent escape from the capsule or its reaction with the
              capsule walls.  Preliminary experiments suggest this will be a fruitful
              subject. Though more details will emerge as the experiments proceed.  Depending
              on the initial results, the project shall proceed to the electron transfer
              experiments, to the experiments to determine migration of reagents across
              capsular walls and to capsule/capsule and capsule/bead experiments.

This
              award is in the area of novel, environmentally-friendly processes for forming
              polymers via photopolymerization, and is relevant to technologically important
              materials such as photoresists and optical-fiber coatings.
