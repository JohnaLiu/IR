Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              prototype Spin Dependent Tunneling (SDT) devices by combining high-speed
              magnetic thin films and low-RC SDT structures achieved in Phase I.  These
              devices will be fabricated using standard microelectronic photolithography and
              packaging techniques, suitable for volume production.  Sub-nanosecond switching
              will be demonstrated with these devices which are integrated with integrated
              circuit (IC) electronics. Fast IC electronics will be implemented using low
              voltage differential signaling (LVDS).  SDT devices exhibit large signal, low
              switching field, and high resistance, which lead to high sensitivity, low power
              consumption, and small size and weight, when compared with giant
              magnetoresistive (GMR) devices.  Fast SDT devices will require improvements in
              both magnetic speed and electronic speed, while existing attractive static
              properties need to be maintained.  Phase II is expected to produce integrated
              SDT devices with state-of-the-art properties and switching time less than one
              nanosecond.

Potential commercial applications for this research are expected
              in high-speed isolators, high-speed magnetic field and current sensing devices,
              fast magnetic random access memories (MRAM), reconfigurable magnetic logic,
              read heads, and gigahertz (GHz) inductor/transformers, as well as their
              derivative products.
