Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State University
              will acquire a a Superconducting Quantum Interface Device (SQUID) magnetometer.
              This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) synthesis and
              characterization of open-shell molecules and materials; b) crystalline and
              liquid crystalline metal halides; c) magnetic susceptibility in
              metalloproteins; and d) development of novel contrast agents for magnetic
              resonance imaging.   

A SQUID magnetometer is critical for studying the
              magnetic properties of materials, particularly for weakly magnetic/small moment
              samples.  In a DC magnetization measurement, one measures the magnetic moment
              as a function of applied DC magnetic field (and/or temperature).  Using DC
              magnetization experiments, one can determine magnetic moments or a hysteresis
              curve, or identify magnetic phase transitions.  In such a fashion, complete
              magnetic characterization of single crystal samples and films is possible. 
              These types of measurements are essential in order to understand polymers and
              thin films.
