Abstract    :
              Vincent Catalano of the University of Nevada at Reno is supported by the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program in  research on
              design,  synthesis  and characterization of a new class of metal-containing
              cage complexes. These complexes are called metallocryptates. Synthesis of a
              large number of phosphine-based ligands will be followed by study of the
              binding of various d10 metal species (such as Ag(I) and Au(I)), and of anions,
              with those ligands. Spectroscopic and photochemical studies will be carried out
              on the complexes thus produced, in order to clarify important new effects
              (including special features of  metal-metal bonding) made possible by this mode
              of complex formation.

Previous NSF-funded  work by this research group has
              demonstrated that molecular structures that have metal ions as components can
              serve to encapsulate yet other metallic species, and further that this mode of
              complex formation can generate phenomena that are not  otherwise observable.
              For example, when cations of gold (aurous ions) are incorporated as guests into
              metal-containing host molecules, intense luminescence due to gold-gold
              interactions develops. In this case, the encapsulating ligand protects the gold
              dimer from disruption. In the current phase of the work, promising leads will
              be followed up, and new phenomena sought.
