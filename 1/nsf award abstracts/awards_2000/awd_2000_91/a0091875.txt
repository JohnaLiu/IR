              ABSTRACT: OPP-0091875

The Western Aleutians Archaeological and
              Paleobiological Project, conducted by an international team (U.S.A., France,
              and Russia) of archaeologists, ecologists, zoologists, paleoethnobotanists, and
              geomorphologists, provides new information about the colonization of the Near
              Islands, sizes of Near Island settlements, communication between Near Island
              groups, and subsistence strategies of prehistoric populations. The project has
              two primary goals: 1) to examine the
nature and characteristics of the western
              Aleutian culture in order to assess its particularities and the degree of
              cultural exchange with politically and culturally independent neighboring Aleut
              subgroups, and 2) to document Holocene environmental change in Beringia and
              determine,
to what extent, these changes impacted prehistoric human
              communities. The project's past contributions include extensive documentation,
              mapping, sampling, and analysis to provide a chronological and ethnographic
              framework. During the new phase, The international team will return to Austin
              Cove, Attu Island, where archaeologists/ecologists will excavate different
              features
including: 1) a "chief's house, 2) a non-elite dwelling, 3) a Russian
              Period house, and 4) different types of storage features, to understand the
              timing of cultural changes which resulted in increasing complexity and study
              the environmental variables bracketing such changes. A
thorough understanding
              of Holocene environmental change in the region should provide clues in how
              prehistoric Aleuts adapted to their maritime world. Additionally, some of the
              most dramatic social and political changes occurred during the Russian/Aleut
              contact period. The excavation
of the Russian period house feature should
              provide information on social/ economic changes which resulted from this
              cultural integration.
