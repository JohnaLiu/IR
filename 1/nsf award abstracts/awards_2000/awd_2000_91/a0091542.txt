Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive model of protein
              adsorption at solid/liquid interfaces, based on statistical mechanics and
              supported by experimental data.  This model will be used to calculate protein
              density profiles and orientations at solid surfaces.  Four new aspects of this
              research include the following: (1) the solvent (water) will be treated
              explicitly in order to capture solvent mediated forces, (2) finite
              concentrations (as opposed to infinite dilution) of proteins and peptides will
              be studied, (3) both conformational changes induced by the surface and
              sequential adsorption of various proteins will be investigated, and (4)
              experiments with deuterated block polypeptides will be performed to provide
              direct evidence of layer thickness, gross morphology and orientation, as well
              as indirect evidence of surface-induced conformational changes.  The results of
              this research could provide useful information for many important application
              including, as examples: (a) cell adhesion on implants, the clogging of
              artificial arteries, and haemofiltration membranes, (b) the fouling of
              biosensor membranes, and (c) the fouling of heat exchangers in food processing
              operations and membranes in protein purification devices.
