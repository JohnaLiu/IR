This grant provides funds for two years of partial salary
              support for technician Lindsey Hedges in the helium dating facility at Caltech.
              The last few years have seen rapid progress in the development and application
              of (U-Th)/He dating, and He ages have been shown to provide quantitative new
              insights to a range of important Earth science problems. Hedges has been an
              integral part of He dating efforts at Caltech, particularly in promoting
              collaborations and in dissemination of the details of the techniques we have
              developed. This Phase II award will allow her to continue to 1) retain
              responsibility for day-to-day maintenance of hardware and supplies in the He
              dating laboratory, 2) educate new users from within Caltech and in the outside
              community in how to prepare and analyze He age samples, 3) analyze samples
              supplied by collaborators, and 4) prepare, distribute, analyze, and evaluate a
              small number of mineral standards for distribution within the rapidly growing
              He dating community.
