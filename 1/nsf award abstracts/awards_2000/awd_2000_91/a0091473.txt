Abstract    :
              DELTA (Description Language for Taxonomy) is a widely used program written to
              manage morphological data for taxonomy.  Taxonomy is a basic part of biology, 
              involving the classification of the Earth's biota.  Cataloging and
              understanding biodiversity is dependent on good taxonomy.  DELTA has grown
              through the years but has also developed problems reflecting scalability, data
              format consistency, and a lack of user-friendliness.   DELTA will be reworked
              from scratch, with the best features of the present system plus new features of
              data management and functionality.  Such tools have been identified by the
              community as necessary for sharing information about taxonomic characters. The
              software will be distributed through the web.  In addition to streamlining the
              gathering, standardizing and distribution  of morphological data on fossil and
              living taxa, the software will be a teaching tool for systematics.
