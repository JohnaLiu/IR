Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
              Riverside will acquire a Hybrid Quadrupole/Orthogonal Time-of-Flight  Mass
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including a) regiochemistry of ring assembly; b) fragments from chemical
              cleavage of proteins; c) isotopic labeling of steroids and seco-steroids; d)
              particulate formation in smog chamber simulations; e) synthesis of
              heterofullerenes; and f) deuterium exchange on platinum surfaces.  

Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
              to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
              and organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry, polymer processing
              and biology.
