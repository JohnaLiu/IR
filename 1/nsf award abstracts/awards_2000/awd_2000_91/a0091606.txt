Abstract    :
              The science of psychology has produced a large body of outstanding research on
              behavioral and social phenomena. In terms of public awareness, however, the
              potential of psychology may be among the best kept secrets in science, among
              the public, policymakers, and other scientists. The American Psychological
              Society is launching a new journal to address this problem. "Psychological
              Science in the Public Interest (PSPI)" will present the best scientific
              evidence on issues of public interest. This grant will broaden the
              dissemination of PSPI reports to the public.
