Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              new class of cement-steel interfaces for high performance steel reinforcing
              bars for concrete.  In Phase I the project demonstrated a bar coating system
              that can protect against corrosion of steel in concrete structures and has
              improved adhesion characteristics between steel reinforcement and the cement
              matrix.  Phase II continues to refine the properties and techniques for
              producing this new class of High Performance Non-corroding Steel-Reinforced
              Concrete. 

Improved corrosion resistance of steel reinforcement in concrete
              structures could address a major infrastructure problem that has been estimated
              to require up to $3 trillion for repair. The potentially cost effective
              coatings to be developed and commercially applied during production runs in
              steel mills would result in a value added product of major importance for
              managing the infrastructure. Improvements in adherence and corrosion resistance
              would be highly beneficial, for example,  in corrosive highway deicing
              environments and marine structures.
