Abstract    :
              This award to Dr. Roger Leblanc of the University of Miami is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemsitry Program.   The research focuses on the
              development of surfaces, based on Langmuir-Blodgett techniques, which have high
              specificity for target biomolecules, and would be used for sensor development. 
              The research is multi-disciplinary and will include the areas of synthesis,
              interfacial chemistry and analytical chemistry (sensor development and
              characterization).  The key qoals of the project are 1) synthesis of a
              lipid/organic monolayer at the water/air interface using combinatorial
              chemistry, 2) determine the monolayer  specificity toward target biomolecules,
              3) determine whether the specificity of the monolayer be enhanced by using
              target templates during the synthesis, and 4) use the sensor with actual
              biological systems. 

This is a novel research proposal at the frontier of
              biosensor development.  It has a degree of risk, however, the investigator
              makes a concerted effort to address the potential problems.  The potential for
              involvement of minority students is high.  The impact of this research will be
              felt in the areas of combinatorial synthesis, biochemistry, surface chemistry
              and sensor development.  In the future, there is potential for societal impact
              if sensor applications develop in biological systems.
