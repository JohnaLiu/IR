Abstract    :
              Birds have excellent visual acuity, color vision, pattern discrimination
              ability, and visual memory, all of which are almost equal to, or sometimes
              superior to, these same abilities of the highly visual primates.   Although the
              overall pattern of brain organization is similar among all vertebrates, the
              neural substrates responsible for these visual abilities appear to be different
              between birds and primates.  How is it possible that anatomically different
              brains solve similar biological problems of visual information processing? 
              This project focuses on the tectofugal pathway in the pigeon brain, which is
              critical for many visual discrimination tasks. Anatomical, lesion, and
              molecular techniques will be used to study the organization and function of the
              pathway in mate recognition.  In particular, a computer-animated pigeon--
              "virtual pigeon"-- will be presented to male pigeons to investigate how a
              complex natural signal is processed in the tectofugal pathway.  Comparative
              research data from the distinct systems of birds and primates will contribute
              to understanding the general and specific principles of the two neural systems.
               Such information in turn will be important to increase the understanding of
              the origin and evolution of these abilities in different species.
