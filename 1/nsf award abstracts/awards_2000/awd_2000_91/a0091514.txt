Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to use a two-dimensional (latitude-height)
              chemical-dynamical model to investigate the reasons for wide variations in the
              mean-age of stratospheric air in model simulations. The mean-age conveys
              information about the parcel transport time scales in the lower stratosphere in
              the presence of diffusion, when photochemical processes occur along parcel
              trajectories. The impact of horizontal mixing, stratospheric oscillations
              (quasi-biennial and semi-annual), and mesospheric photochemical destruction on
              the mean-age of stratospheric air will be examined. Dr. Zhu's theoretical and
              modeling analysis will help clarify the physical and mathematical basis for the
              age-of-air concept, and lead to its more accurate estimation.
