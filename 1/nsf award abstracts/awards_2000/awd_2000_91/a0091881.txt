Glycosyltransferases are enzymes that catalyze the creation
              of glycosidic bonds to sugars.  These enzymes are responsible for the creation
              of an incredibly diverse and important group of compounds that range from
              cellulose and starch to the heterogeneous oligosaccharides that are found at
              the surface of cells.  The mechanisms by which these enzymes work are not well
              characterized.  The research described here is aimed at elucidation of
              glycosyltransferase mechanisms, in particular the sialyltransferase and
              trans-sialidase enzymes.  These enzymes catalyze formation of glycosidic bonds
              to N-acetylneuraminic acid, a negatively charged sugar often located at the
              non-reducing termini of oligosaccharides on the cell surface.  The four
              specific aims of this work are to measure oxygen-18 isotope effects for
              sialyltransferase and trans-sialidase, use mutagenesis to perform chemical
              rescue of trans-sialidase, analyze the isotope effects with ab-initio
              computational techniques, and synthesize novel inhibitors of
              sialyltransferases.  The results of these studies will allow for a deeper
              understanding of how these enzymes function and provide information required
              for manipulation of their activity.  Further, the mechanistic information
              dovetails into the synthetic work by providing the basis for logical inhibitor
              design.
