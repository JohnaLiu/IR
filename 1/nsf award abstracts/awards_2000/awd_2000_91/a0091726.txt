Abstract    :
              The research award to Dr. Isiah Warner and Dr. Robert Strongin at Louisiana
              State University entitled "Studies in Organized Media" is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  The project goal is an improved
              fundamental understanding of the chemistry involved in chromatographic
              separations.  In particular, the research will examine the molecular
              recognition capabilities of specifically designed media used in both liquid
              chromatography and capillary electrophoresis.  The media to be studied include
              a variety of polymeric surfactants and cyclodextrins.  The results of this
              research will be applied to the development of improved separation capabilities
              and new analytical methods which will impact significant environmental analysis
              problems.

This research project may have a significant impact on the
              development of new materials used in separations.  The research will also
              result in new methods of analysis with important environmental applications. 
              Additionally, the investigators will have a significant impact on the mentoring
              of minority students and providing students with experience in high quality,
              systematic experimental design and implementation.  The research project may
              also have an important impact on society through the development of improved
              environmental  methods.
