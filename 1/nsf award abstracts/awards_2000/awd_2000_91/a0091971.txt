This grant provides partial support for the installation
              of a linux PC cluster in the department of Geological Sciences at the
              University of Michigan. The PI, Peter van Keken, is an assistant professor
              specializing in geodynamics.  In addition to Van Keken, the facility will be
              used by Lars Stixrude, Carolina Lithgow-Bertelloni and Larry Ruff.  The cluster
              will be used extensively for modeling of Earth's structure and dynamics with
              focus on thermochemical convection, chemical mixing, Earth's thermal evolution
              and ab-initio crystal structure calculations. Computational methods are based
              on parallel domain decomposition of 2D and 3D finite element applications,
              parallel Fourier transforms and Monte-Carlo investigations of multi-parameter
              spaces.  This facility will support collaborative projects with investigators
              at several institutions that include Purdue, Arizona State, Minnesota, and
              Yale. The cluster will be integrated with the geophysics computational and
              visualization facilities.
