	This award provides funding support for the development of
              a novel technique to measure the intensity of the earth's magnetic field in the
              past at the time of cooling of volcanic rocks. The method is based on the
              Thellier-Thellier analysis of magnetism in single grains of plagioclase
              feldspar crystals formed during cooling. A new CO2 laser heating system will
              permit in situ step-heating of single feldspar grains in petrographic thin
              sections during the analysis of paleomagnetic intensity and represents an
              advance in the reliability of the paleomagnetic measurement. Determining the
              intensity and direction of the earth's paleomagnetic field is a necessary tool
              for reconstructing past tectonic plate motions and gaining an understanding of
              past processes in the metallic core of the earth.
