              ABSTRACT

PIs: 	Suflita and Wall
Institution:	U of Oklahoma and U of
              Missouri
Proposal #:	DEB-0091243 

The PIs request a travel grant to support
              up to 10 US early career scientists (postdocs) for up to 6 months in European
              laboratories. While there, they would learn the latest bioremediation
              techniques being developed in the labs and participate in research and seminar
              activities. A counterpart EU proposal has been submitted to the appropriate
              European institution to support the travel of up to 10 European postodcs to
              labs in the US for a similar purpose. This young scientist exchange program
              grew out of the US/EC Task Force on Biotechnology activities in the area of
              Environmental Biotechnology. It follows up successful multi-national workshops
              held in Brussels in 1994 and Granada in 1996 and an intensive training course
              held at Rutgers University in 1998. The two PIs who will manage the travel
              grants have been active members of the Environmental Biotechnology Working
              Group that has developed the activity agenda following the 1994 workshop.
