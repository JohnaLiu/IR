Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build upon
              the exciting results of Phase I, which  demonstrated that whispering gallery
              mode (WGM) resonances of a microsphere can be tuned over a significant range by
              sweeping the microsphere's temperature.  It is intended to employ this effect
              to produce a temperature-tunable optical filter suitable for development of a
              next-generation optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) for remotely monitoring dense
              wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) networks. Such a device will greatly
              benefit the telecommunications industry by providing a means of embedded
              real-time monitoring of system operation and signal quality. This capability
              has the potential to virtually eliminate costly system failures. The plan for
              reaching the project goal is to develop a first-generation prototype and use
              this prototype to demonstrate the expected capabilities of a next-generation
              OSA. 

The initial application for the technology is as an embedded test and
              monitoring system for telecommunications fiber networks. The major customers
              are optical network installers and service providers.
