Recently, the P.I. collaborated in determining a
              high-resolution crystal structure for a prototypical nucleic acid sugar
              methyltransferase complexed with its cofactor and RNA substrate. This enzyme,
              vaccinia virus protein VP39, methylates messenger RNA at the 2'OH of a ribose
              within the 5' end cap structure. The structural data afford an unusual
              opportunity to identify the chemical processes underlying nucleic acid ribose
              methylation. Atomic-scale examination of the enzyme's catalytic center with
              bound substrate and cofactor suggests a mechanism whereby the charged oxygen
              generated by deprotonation of the target ribose hydroxyl attacks the trivalent
              sulfur of the methyl-donating cofactor (S-adenosylmethionine), effecting
              displacement of cofactor-product (S-adenosylhomocysteine). Although the
              sidechain of VP39 residue Lysine 175 is well-positioned to effect deprotonation
              of the hydroxyl, lysine 175's pKa would need to be depressed ~three orders of
              magnitude. The sidechain of a neighboring residue, arginine 209 may cause this
              depression to occur, and aspartate 138 may act as the proton sink (assuming a
              pKa elevation in the aspartate 138 sidechain). 
To determine whether the
              target hydroxyl is indeed deprotonated in the context of VP39, NMR will be used
              to investigate hydroxyl-deprotonation of the VP39-bound isotope-enriched RNA
              substrate. Next, VP39 sidechain pKa values will be examined after (1)
              modification of a unique-cysteine-175 substitution mutant with an
              isotope-enriched aminoethylation reagent and/or (2) generating proteins in
              which lysine 175, arginine 209 or aspartate 138 each comprise half of a
              uniquely 13C/15N enriched dipeptide. In combination with mutagenesis, these
              selective labeling strategies will facilitate the determination of sidechain
              pKa in the presence and absence of cofactor-product.
