Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in Madison
              will upgrade their computer system to a 60-node parallel cluster.  This
              equipment will enhance research in the following areas:  a) spectroscopic and
              computational studies of metalloenzyme structure and function; b) studies of
              bonding, electronic and vibrational properties of chemisorbed molecules and
              molecular thin films; c) mechanistic organic chemistry of relevance to the
              interstellar medium; d) time- and frequency-domain vibrational spectroscopy of
              carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin; e) validation and application of new NBO-
              and QCE-based ab initio methods; and f) static and dynamic properties of
              polymers and complex fluids.  

This upgrade will provide a massively
              parallel processor system for fast computation and the ability to distribute
              many types of computations.  The massively parallel processor will form the
              backbone for a new Facility for Integrated Research in Computational Chemistry,
              a networked system of 24 computers to be used for research and graduate-level
              instruction in computational chemistry methods.  The research to be carried out
              using this resource will have a significant impact in a number of areas,
              including biochemistry and materials sciences.
