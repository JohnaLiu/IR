Abstract    :
              The Montana EPSCoR Infrastructure project targets three research areas to
              enhance Montana's research infrastructure:  (1) Integrative Analysis of Complex
              Biological Systems, which will integrate the traditional players in
              environmental sciences with expertise in the physical and social sciences at
              the University of Montana and Montana State University; (2) Nanotechnology,
              which will combine and leverage existing Montana State University's expertise
              in optical technology, electrical engineering, physics, chemistry and life
              sciences on issues of nanotechnology; and (3) Biological Structure and
              Function, which will integrate biological researchers from several University
              of Montana departments, centers and institutes to provide a forum for
              collaboration and reserach emphasis.  The goal is to increase the
              competitiveness of these institutions in obtaining multi-investigator research
              awards from a variety of sources.                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                      Infrastructure enhancements in these areas will build on the strengths
              of the institutions.  In addition, Montana will expand the quality and number
              of graduate students in each of the target areas, increase the direct
              involvement of undergraduates in research, and establish new initiatives in
              education and outreach that will have significant regional and national impact.
