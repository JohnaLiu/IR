Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Rochester will
              upgrade a picosecond UV-vis-NIR pump-probe transient absorption spectrometer.
              This equipment will enhance research in the following areas:  1) quantum
              amplified isomerization; 2) mechanistic investigations of group 14 cation
              radical reactions; 3) nature and decay dynamics of photogenerated interchain
              species in conjugated polymers; 4) decay kinetics of ion radical pairs to
              determine return electron transfer rate constants; 5) studies of charge
              transfer processes in platinum diimine complexes; and 6) carbon nanotube
              electronics and interface vibrational dynamics.


A picosecond laser
              provides ultrafast pulses of coherent visible or infrared light, which enables
              researchers to obtain important information about fast occurring chemical
              reactions.  Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the
              properties of reactive and nonreactive molecules.  These studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including polymer chemistry.
