Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon in
              Eugene will acquire a mass spectrometer with atmospheric electrospray and
              chemical ionization sources, an interfaced liquid chromatography instrument and
              a central computer controller with data analysis software. This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including a) novel aromatic and
              metalla-aromatic systems; b) small-ring metallacycles; c) organic and medicinal
              chemistry; d) studies of radical cage effects in photochemically degradable
              polymers; e) solid-state inorganic materials; and f) molecular organization of
              conjugated polymer solids and two-dimensional peptide crystals.  

Mass
              spectrometry is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to
              obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and
              organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an impact in
              a number of areas including medicinal, polymer and solid-state chemistry.
