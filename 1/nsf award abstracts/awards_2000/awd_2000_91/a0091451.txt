Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              short-exposure imaging sensor for measuring and controlling particle
              temperature and velocity of thermal sprays.  Thermal spray is a rapidly growing
              element of the metals processing industry, which needs process control. 
              Currently, there are no direct particle condition controls, for lack of a
              sensor to provide real-time measurements.  This imaging sensor technology will
              continuously view the entire particle stream, utilize the entire emission
              across the spectral range of the sensor, and employ fast image processing
              algorithms to obtain on-line measurements.  Phase II will develop a sensor
              response model, hardware and software design, and prototype sensors will be
              constructed and calibration tested.  These sensors will be incorporated in
              process control systems and operated in an industrial environment.

Thermal
              spray technology is changing and improving the way high quality metal parts are
              manufactured for the automotive, aerospace, energy, and heavy equipment
              industries.  Sensor and thermal spray controls will provide new levels of cost
              efficiency and consistency to challenges in material processing, namely
              thermal, wear and corrosion, by coating the surface with metals and ceramics.
