Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Delaware will acquire
              a X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule diffractometry.
              This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including studies of
              a)polymorphs and superlattices; b) coordination and bioinorganic chemistry with
              sulfur ligands; c) paramagnetic chromium alkyl complexes; d) bioinorganic
              copper and heme-copper dioxygen chemistry; e) helicenes as potential asymmetric
              catalysts; f) molecular shaped directed crystal engineering; and g) microporous
              aluminosilicate materials: structure and formation mechanism.

The X-ray
              diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
              dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
              it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
              relative to the neighboring molecules.  These studies will have an impact in a
              number of areas, including the preparation of more efficient catalysts,
              materials chemistry and biochemistry.
