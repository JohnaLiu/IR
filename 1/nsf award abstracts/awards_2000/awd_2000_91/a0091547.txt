Somasundaran

This two-year award, which supports U.S.-Italy
              cooperative research on interactions of nanoparticles of dendrimers/liposomes
              with polymers and surfactants, involves Ponisseril Somasundaran of Columbia
              University and M.F. Ottaviani of the Institute of Chemical Sciences in Urbino,
              Italy.  The objective of their research is to enable the use of electron spin
              resonance to monitor conformation of polymers and surfactants at interfaces.
              

The U. S. principal investigator brings to this collaboration his group's
              expertise in identifying the best conformation of polymers and proteins for
              determining the interactions between nanoparticles and dendrimers with surface
              active species.  The US co-PI provides experience with applied supramolecular
              structure-function and structure-reactivity relationships toward understanding
              the behavior of adsorption at interfaces.  This work is complemented by the
              Italian investigator's expertise in the use of electron spin resonance probes
              for examination of adsorption at interfaces. The results of this research are
              expected to contribute to knowledge of the behavior of vital industrial
              systems.
