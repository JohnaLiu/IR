The proposed work will continue a study of the cosmic
              microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE)
              with the ACBAR (Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver) instrument,
              operating at South Pole station.  Because of its stable atmosphere and
              extremely low water vapor, the South Pole is the best known terrestrial site
              from which to carry out this program of observations.  The instrument itself is
              a sixteen element bolometer array, operating at 0.03 deg K, designed
              specifically for observations of CMB anisotropy and the SZE. It will operate in
              atmospheric windows spanning millimeter to submillimeter wavelengths; extending
              the spectral range over which observations of anisotropies are made is
              necessary to separate cosmic microwave background signals from foreground
              contamination. The combination of sensitive detectors, high angular resolution,
              and broad frequence coverage the instrument will advance cosmology research on
              several fronts.  The project will determine cluster peculiar velocities (the
              motion of galaxy clusters with respect to the rest frame of the CMB), extend
              measurements of primordial CMB anisotropies to small angular scales, and serve
              as a natural complement to balloon and satellite missions at larger angular
              scales.
