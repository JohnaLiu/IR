In higher plants, the sperm in the male pollen are
              delivered to the egg in the female pistil via a growing pollen tube. For
              fertilization to occur, there must be very specific pollen-pistil recognition
              between compatible species.  The work focuses on proteins in the pollen tube
              called Pex proteins.  The structure and location of the Pex proteins suggest
              that they are recognition molecules.  A series of genetic and molecular biology
              experiments   will  test whether or not this is the case. These studies will
              have an impact on the development of improved crop species in two ways.  First,
              it is imperative that we understand the nature of reproductive barriers in
              plants because of valid concerns about cross pollination of genetically
              engineered crop plants with neighboring plant species. Second, future
              experiments will focus on manipulating Pex proteins to selectively circumvent
              reproductive barriers between plant species in order to introduce desirable
              traits, for example from wild species into domesticated species.
