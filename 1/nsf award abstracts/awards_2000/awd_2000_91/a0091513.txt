Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will complete
              development of a production Smart Variable Geometry Socket (SVGS) for
              transtibial amputees (TTAs) and will test it with a clinical study. This
              non-electrical system is a simple means for ensuring and maintaining a good
              socket fit, with security and stability increased over the state of the art.
              Poorly fitting sockets, which cause pain and skin lesions, are responsible for
              a significant portion of TTAs rejecting a prosthesis. The SVGS/TT utilizes
              suction retention, which provides an important benefit, particularly to
              diabetics, by increasing blood circulation in the residual limb.

The unique
              SVGS system consists of multiple, liquid-filled bladders placed by the
              prosthetist during socket fitting and a control for maintaining appropriate
              pressures on the residual limb at selected locations, all contained within the
              dimensions of a conventional prosthesis. The SVGS can be applied by the
              prosthetist with existing equipment and conventional art, thereby minimizing
              implementation cost. This attribute will enhance market acceptance. Phase I
              demonstrated feasibility; Phase II will measure efficacy and acceptance by
              TTAs. Phase II results will be the catalyst for successful commercialization.
