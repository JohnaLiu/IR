Transport and mixing in the ocean will be studied using a
              sequence of models.  Initially, a quasi-geostrophic model will be used to
              produce 'true' velocity fields.  The resultant turbulent velocities will be
              used to transport Lagrangian particles throughout the domain.  The results will
              be compared to modeled dispersion using a sequence of Markov models (orders 0,
              1, 2, and 3).  These allow for diffusive, ballistic, sub and super diffusive
              behavior.  These studies will also be used to understand the phenomenological
              behavior of the models.  Results of the stochastic models will be compared with
              observed float characteristics from different regions of the ocean.  More
              realistic, primitive equation models will also be investigated.  Effects of
              low-frequency variability in flow structure, wind-forcing variability,
              eddy-induced flows, three-dimensional flows, and sources will be investigated. 
              Two other questions of interest are the impact of rough topography and the
              impact of non-Gaussian forcing in the Markovian models. Incorporation of
              stochastic terms in the Eulerian partial differential equations, to simulate
              the role of the Markov models, is contemplated towards the end of the
              project.
