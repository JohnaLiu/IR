Abstract    :
              Professor John Lombardi of City University of New York, City College is
              supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform
              experimental studies on metal dimer binding.  A specialized facility has been
              developed over the years at CUNY to mass select and deposit metal dimers and
              trimers in matrices and study them using Raman spectroscopy.  This proposal
              seeks to expand previous work by including heteronuclear dimers, and to examine
              gold-M clusters (with M= La, Lu, Ce) which are relevant to the catalysis of
              proplyene oxide, an important industrial process.  Collaboration with a
              theorist allows quantum chemical approaches to be brought to bear on the
              interpretation of these results on metal-metal binding.  The gold clusters will
              also help theorists to understand relativistic effects.  


Increasing the
              importance of metal cluster studies is the recent effort by scientists to
              manipulate matter using nanotechnology.  Metal clusters are also of interest in
              the field of catalysis.  Understanding metal to metal binding is relevant to
              inorganic chemical synthesis and the production of new materials.  CUNY City
              College is a Hispanic Serving Institution.
