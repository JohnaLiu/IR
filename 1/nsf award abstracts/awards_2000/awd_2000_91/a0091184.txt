Abstract:
One of the ways a
              nervous system undergoes change is to modify the connections between nerve
              cells.  This often requires the action of specialized secreted enzymes, which
              degrade or otherwise modify the local cellular environment, thus permitting
              modifications in the connections between neurons and their targets.  An
              important class of these secreted enzymes is the "serine proteinases".  These
              proteinases are widely conserved in evolution, and have been shown to be
              important in both the establishment and modification of neural connections
              during development, as well as in the later modifications associated with
              learning and memory. Serine proteinases are in turn regulated by a special
              class of proteins known as "serpins" (serine proteinase inhibitors).  The
              serpins and serine proteinases, therefore, function as an interdependent system
              of secreted proteins of key importance in regulating nervous system change.  In
              order to understand these proteins better Dr. Keshishian will examine their
              biological functions in a model genetic system, Drosophila.  In Drosophila Dr.
              Keshishian has already identified the key "neuroserpin" of the nervous system,
              and has noted that it is expressed at connections between motoneurons and
              muscles. The major goal is to examine its functions at the developing
              neuromuscular connections, and to test the effects of both its loss and
              overexpression. The Drosophila neuroserpin is closely related to its mammalian
              counterpart, and insights gained in Drosophila about its function and
              regulation will be of value in understanding how the serpins influence nervous
              system development in general.
