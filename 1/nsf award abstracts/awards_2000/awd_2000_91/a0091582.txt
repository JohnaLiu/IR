Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue to
              develop a solder self-assembly process that was the concept explored in Phase
              I. It will build upon the successful Phase I results that demonstrated the use
              of solder to self-assemble two-dimensional surface micromachined
              Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) into useful three-dimensional
              structures. This concept is a next step in the evolution of MEMS assembly. The
              overall objective of Phase II is to move the technology from the lab
              environment to a commercial production process that is well understood and has
              excellent yield. Research personnel from industry and education are involved
              and state-of-the-art equipment will be utilized.

A number of promising
              commercial applications have been identified and discussions with potential
              commercial partners suggest interest in commercializing this technology.
