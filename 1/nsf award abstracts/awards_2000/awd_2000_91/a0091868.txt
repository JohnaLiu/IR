Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will enable the Department of Chemistry at The University of Arkansas
              to acquire a 9.4 Tesla Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass
              Spectrometer equipped with both electrospray and matrix assisted laser
              desorption ionization. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
              areas, including a) investigations of the structure and dynamics of proteins;
              b) rapid and accurate characterization of bacteria; and c) analysis of
              synthesis polymers.  

Mass spectrometry is a technique used to probe
              intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
              array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules.  The acquisition of
              this capability in mass spectrometry will have a significant impact in the
              areas of polymer chemistry and biochemistry.
