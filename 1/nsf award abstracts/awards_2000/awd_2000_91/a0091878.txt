Abstract    :
              This project is investigating the atmospheric hydrogen (H2) budget using
              isotopic measurements.  H2 is the second most abundant reactive gas in the
              troposphere and is directly tied to the cycling of carbon monoxide (CO),
              methane (CH4), and non-methane hydrocarbons via the photochemical formation and
              destruction of formaldehyde (HCHO).  Currently, the global H2 budget is
              balanced only to within about 50%.  Measurements are being made of the ratio of
              deuterium to hydrogen (D/H) in marine locations, in areas during biomass
              burning, and in H2 produced by the photolysis of HCHO, and during soil uptake
              of H2.  The degree of enrichment of deuterium in these samples will indicate
              the relative importance of the soil and the photochemical sinks for H2.  This
              work is helping to resolve the current discrepancies in the global budget of H2
              and contribute to the overall understanding of the importance of increasing
              concentrations of CO, CH4, and H2 in the troposphere.  Also, if H2 becomes an
              important energy source in the future, it will become even more important to
              understand its global budget.
