Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project is designed to
              develop and demonstrate a new in situ treatment technology for the destruction
              of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in groundwater.  The gasoline additive MTBE
              is the second most prevalent groundwater contaminant in the United States, and
              there are currently no economical technologies for its removal from the water
              supply.  This technology utilizes a novel bacterium of the species
              Hydrogenophaga flava (ENV735) for the remediation of MTBE. This bacterium,
              which was recently isolated by Envirogen scientists, is one of only two
              bacterial strains discovered that are capable of growth on MTBE.  Phase II
              experiments will be conducted to:  (1) assess the movement and distribution of
              the bacterium in the subsurface; (2) develop an adhesion-deficient strain for
              improved aquifer distribution; and (3) optimize commercial-scale growth,
              shipment, and injection of the bacterium for field application.  A field
              demonstration will be conducted to fully test the technology under in situ
              conditions.  

The bioaugmentation with ENV735 has broad potential as an in
              situ remediation technology for MTBE-contaminated aquifers. If the results of
              the field trial are positive, commercialization of the bioaugmentation
              technology is anticipated in the short term.
