Abstract    :
              The Computer Science and Engineering Technology (CSET) Scholars program is
              providing scholarships in computer science and engineering technologies, with
              special consideration to underrepresented groups (women and minorities) from
              the community's federally designated enterprise community and state designated
              enterprise zone. Participants are pursuing associate of applied science degrees
              in webmastering, e- commerce, computer programming, computer networking,
              computer maintenance, digital media design, electrical and computerized control
              systems, robotics, laser electro- optics, chemical technology, semiconductor
              manufacturing, biomedical equipment, medical imaging, facilities maintenance
              engineering, drafting and design, manufacturing engineering, machine shop
              operations, and other applied engineering programs. Program objectives are
              recruitment of qualified students, implementation of support systems to aid in
              retaining students once enrolled, course instruction, and job placement upon
              graduation. A support system provides mentoring and tutoring services to CSET
              Scholars, with additional support as required provided by the Deaf and Disabled
              Student Services Office and the Women's Resource Center. Participants meet
              biweekly with a small advisory committee comprised of representatives of these
              campus support offices, with each meeting designed to address unmet needs and
              troubleshoot problems which may be preventing the CSET Scholar from achieving
              success in his or her area of study. Job placement at the program's conclusion
              is being facilitated through the major course of study, as each department has
              an industrial advisory committee and other liaisons with industry which assist
              with graduate employment. Evaluation of program success is based on grade point
              average, attendance, completion rates, survey responses, and graduation
              placement.
