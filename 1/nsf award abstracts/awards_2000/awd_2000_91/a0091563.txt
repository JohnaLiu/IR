Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              giant-magnetoresistive (GMR) sensing devices that yield superior hysteresis
              performance over existing bridge sensors and GMR signal isolators and provide
              intrinsic self-biasing without using affixed magnets or power consuming coils. 
              Phase I demonstrated that edge pinning techniques can be used to fabricate low
              hysteresis push-pull and shielded bridge sensors with designed bias points. 
              Before the technology can be commercialized, Phase II research must:  (1)
              develop hard edge resistor elements that minimize hysteresis and maximize
              signal; (2)  optimize hard edge processing and implementation;  (3) determine
              the viability of alternate pinning strategies; (4) develop specification,
              architecture, and physical designs for prototype sensor or isolator products;
              (5) fabricate target devices; and (6) characterize devices for magnetic and
              electrical responses.   A fully developed magnetic field sensor and/or signal
              isolator is expected, one that is ready for commercialization.

Potential
              commercial applications are discrete low hysteresis bridge sensors and
              isolators, improved digital magnetic switches, and ultra-low field sensors
              employing integrated circuit (IC) based feedback amplifiers.
