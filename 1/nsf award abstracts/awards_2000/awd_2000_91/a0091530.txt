              Government: A Geospatial Decision Support System for Drought Risk
              Management

This project will develop and integrate new information
              technologies for improved government services in the U.S. Department of
              Agriculture (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA).  The mission of the RMA is to
              strengthen the safety net for agricultural procedures (farmers) through sound
              risk management programs and education.  Rick management in agriculture is
              critically important to producers, their communities, and the nation's economy,
              but it involves many complex problems.

Our objective is to improve, through
              research and advanced development, the RMA's risk assessment services in three
              important ways:

To speed risk assessment with automation
To enhance risk
              assessment with increased spatial and temporal resolution and additional input
              variables      To extend risk assessment to forecasts and economic analyses
