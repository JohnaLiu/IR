In partnership with
              the Federal Energy Information Agency on the topic of trade data, Columbia
              University and the Information Sciences Institute of the University of Southern
              California will work in three areas of relevance to the Agency mission:

1.
              Main memory query processing, which provides extremely fast querying of
              multiple statistical data sets, an area of concern to all statistical agencies
              which must provide aggregated data which maintains the confidentiality of the
              citizens and businesses which contributed the data; 
2. Multilingual question
              and answering, which will explore the possibility of providing automated
              translation and querying from English to Spanish and Chinese, and perhaps one
              other language. As the US population becomes increasingly multi-lingual,
              natural language processing as a service of gov't web sites will become more
              and more expected.
3. Usability testing of components developed in this and in
              another grant to this team under the Digital Government program.
