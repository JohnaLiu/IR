Abstract    :
              This award to Professor Wilfred Tysoe of the University of Wisconsin in
              Milwaukee is jointly supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program
              in the Division of Chemistry and the Civil and Mechanical Systems Program in
              the Engineering Directorate.   The goals of the research project are 1) to
              elucidate the relationship between the surface chemistry of tribological films,
              2) to characterize the film structure and 3) to define the film's tribological
              properties.  Prior research by this investigator has shown that tribological
              films grown in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions are identical to those formed
              under tribological conditions.  A fundamental understanding of the friction and
              wear behavior of the thin films will lead to safer, more effective
              lubricants.

The research project demonstrates an excellent integration of
              education and research.  This fundamental research could have direct impact on
              society in the immediate future by providing lubricant chemists information
              needed for improving lubricant formulations.  Additionally, the current
              additives used in lubricants are being phased out due to environmental
              regulations and it is critical to discover new, effective additives. 
              Lubricants are used in metal working processes to reduce waste, optimize final
              product and increase productivity.  Thus this research is significant and
              timely.
