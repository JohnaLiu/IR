Abstract    :
              This project investigates how brain systems coordinate the sequential order of
              natural patterns of behavior (i.e., action syntax).  Coordination of normal
              sequential patterns is crucial both to human action skills and to the
              instinctive behavior patterns of animals.   Similar brain systems appear to be
              involved in sequential coordination for humans and other mammals.  In
              particular, the brain's neostriatum and its dopamine inputs play a crucial
              role.   The contribution of this brain system will be studied by this project
              using a neuroethological approach, which uses natural behavioral patterns to
              reveal normal brain functions, combined with neural manipulations.

One goal
              of this project is to better understand which subtypes of neostriatal dopamine
              systems control grooming syntax (i.e., which neuroanatomical subregions and
              which neurochemical receptor types).  The ability of microinjections of
              selective dopamine agonists to enhance specific patterns of action will be
              compared across neuroanatomical sites within the neostriatum and a related
              brain structure.

An additional goal is to understand the actual nature of
              the contribution that the neostriatum makes to behavioral sequencing - that is,
              how it helps or what function it contributes.  Experiments will quantify rapid
              changes in sensorimotor modulation in response to sensory stimuli during
              sequences, to examine how hierarchical sensorimotor modulation by the
              neostriatum contributes to sequence implementation.  The results of these
              experiments will improve our knowledge of how natural coordinated sequences of
              behavior are produced by the brain in humans and in other animals.
