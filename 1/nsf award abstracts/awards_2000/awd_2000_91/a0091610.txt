Abstract    :
              Estrogenic endocrine disrupters are chemicals in the environment that are either
              naturally occurring, such as plant estrogens in foods (e.g., soybeans) ,or
              residues in the environment from pesticide use.  These chemicals have been
              blamed for reproductive abnormalities in wildlife.  On the other hand, plant
              estrogens (e.g., genistein) are recommended as a nutritional supplement for
              increased health and relief from menopausal symptoms.  Because development of
              the brain is very sensitive to disruption, research in this area is vitally
              important to understand the potential consequences.  The symposium will focus
              on research concerning exposure to estrogenic compounds and the resulting
              effects on brain anatomy and behavior in developing and adult animals.  The
              participants are scientists with research programs that examine exposure to
              such compounds.  The goal of the symposium is to promote collaboration and
              exchange of information between endocrinologists or those who study hormonal
              systems and toxicologists or those who study the effects of toxic exposures to
              chemical.

	This particular symposium is significant because while many
              recent meetings have focused on endocrine disrupters, none has devoted itself
              to the developing organism's brain and behavior.  A "meeting of the minds" will
              bring together scientists from many disciplines to exchange ideas and views.
