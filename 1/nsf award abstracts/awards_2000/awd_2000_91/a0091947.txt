Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Emory University will acquire a
              400 MHz Solid State NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
              carry out studies on a) macromolecules and macromolecular assemblies; b)
              inorganic/organic clusters and crystals; and c) synthetic organic chemistry.  
              

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from
              these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials
              chemistry.
