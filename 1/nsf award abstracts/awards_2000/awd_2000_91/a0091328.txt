Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, examines the detailed interaction of metal ions and solid surfaces. 
              Hyperthermal aluminum, silicon, and nickel ions are scattered from metal and
              semiconductor surfaces prepared and characterized in ultra-high vacuum.  Both
              symmetric (ion and surface same element) and asymmetric (ion and surface
              different element) scattering measurements are carried out.  Direct measurement
              of the charge state distribution and the probability for inelastic excitation
              of the incident ion is accomplished.  Professor Jory Yarmoff and his
              collaborator Professor Zdenek Sroubek at the University of California-Riverside
              combine experimental studies of these ion-surface interactions with molecular
              dynamics and electronic structure calculations to interpret the detailed
              results.  This information is important for a number of ion based analytical
              and process applications.

The scattering of metal and semiconductor ions
              from metal and semiconductor surfaces is the focus of this research project. 
              Charge exchange and electronic excitation of the incident ion is examined, both
              experimentally and computationally.  Clean and adsorbate modified surfaces are
              examined in these studies.  The results of this work are important to surface
              analytical and materials processing applications.
