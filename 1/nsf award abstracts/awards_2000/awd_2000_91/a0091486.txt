Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              continues its support for the work of Dr. William E. Billups in the Department
              of Chemistry of William Marsh Rice University in Houston.   The work will
              include the synthesis of new elusive compounds, using a vacuum gas-solid
              reaction method  developed by Dr. Billups to prepare small ring alkenes and
              bicycloalkenes from beta-halocyclopropylsilanes.   Aromatic compounds to be
              prepared will include cycloproparenes, fullerenes, buckytubes, and
              functionalized fluorinated single-wall nanotubes.   Low temperature reactions
              of Os atoms with ethylene oxide and of Rh atoms with diazomethane will be
              carried out to complete studies of low temperature reactions of metal atoms
              with organic molecules.   Structures of gas hydrates will be determined by
              low-temperature x-ray crystallography.  

Dr. Billups' research covers a wide
              variety of areas in physical organic chemistry, including the synthesis and
              properties of small ring alkenes and bicycloalkenes, fullerenes, fluorinated
              single-wall carbon nanotubes, and products formed from the reactions of
              transition metal atoms and small organic molecules at low temperatures.   Work
              will be initiated on the nucleation, growth, and structures of methane
              hydrates, with the goal of finding inhibitors for their formation.   These
              hydrates can cause serious problems in long distance natural gas pipelines.
