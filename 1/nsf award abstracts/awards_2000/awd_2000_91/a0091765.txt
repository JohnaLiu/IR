Abstract    :
              This research project, carried out at Carnegie Mellon University in the
              laboratory of Professor Andrew Gellman, is supported in the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program.  It is focussed on the understanding and
              thermodynamic characterization of the transition state for surface catalyzed
              reactions.  Using substituent effects on organic reactants, the nature and
              thermodynamic stability of the surface reaction transition state is probed for
              a series of test reactions.  Varying degrees of fluorine substitution affects
              the activation energy and stability of the transition state for probe reactions
              including dechlorination of chlorofluorocarbons, deprotonation of carboxylic
              acids, and O-H bond cleavage in alcohols.  Experimentally measured energetics
              are compared with the results of high level electronic structure calculations
              to interpret the nature of the surface reaction transition state. 

A
              detailed understanding of the transition state in surface catalyzed chemical
              reactions is useful in catalyst design and process optimization.  By using
              physical organic concepts such as substituent effects on reaction rates,
              Professor Gellman and his coworkers are probing the nature of the surface
              transition state for a series of probe reactions.  Results from these
              measurements are compared with calculations, in order to develop a general
              understanding of the nature of the surface reaction transition state.
