Digital Government: The
              Rulemaking Universe

This award will support planning for a larger project in
              the area of Federal on-line rulemaking, an important part of the Federal
              regulatory process during which the Internet and the Web will serve to support
              the consultative dialog between interested parties and agencies developing or
              modifying rules.  Several Federal Agencies are potential partners in the larger
              project, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of
              Transportation, and the National Marine Fisheries Services.
