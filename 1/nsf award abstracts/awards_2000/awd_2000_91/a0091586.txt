Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the
              development of an enabling technology for computer- directed high-throughput
              screening of proteins with improved properties. Xencor's Protein Design
              Automation (PDA) predicts all the possible amino acid sequences that will fold
              into the three-dimensional structure of a protein. There should be molecules
              among those sequences that have the structure and function of the "parent
              "protein, together with additional novel properties such as increased
              thermo-stability or alkaline pH optima.  In Phase I the company addressed this
              possibility using xylanase as a model protein.  After targeting the active site
              of the enzyme for PDA re-design, the company found sequences that were more
              active than the wild-type protein and one that had a different pH profile.
              These results were achieved by testing only 260 of a possible 110,592
              sequences. In Phase II the company will develop a high-throughput assay system
              that will allow testing the majority of the predicted sequences. The research
              will also improve electrostatic functions of the PDA algorithm, and then use
              this version of the program to re-design the entire xylanase molecule instead
              of just the active site, thereby finding mutations located away from the active
              site that effect the protein's characteristics.

The PDA technology improves
              enzyme efficiency and expands the reactions and process conditions where they
              can be applied.  Major markets include polymer manufacturers, value extraction
              from waste streams and food processing.
