Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              seismic processing system that enables the delivery of leading-edge seismic
              services over the Internet and Intranets.  Internet-based seismic processing
              (INSP) enables exploration companies to directly control their critical seismic
              imaging projects, without the need of purchasing and maintaining expensive
              hardware and software.  INSP is a complete processing system that includes a
              client-based Java GUI, and server-based processing and database modules.  The
              computationally intensive modules run on shared-memory parallel computers and
              Linux clusters.  Phase I implemented the essential functionalities for a useful
              product, demonstrated concept feasibility, and laid the groundwork for the
              Phase II project.  Phase II will add functionality to the product, and
              implement all security and data management aspects necessary for Internet
              deployment. 

INSP ushers in a paradigm shift for the upstream oil and gas
              industry.  Commercial potential is significant because INSP makes digital
              information and compute-intensive technology accessible to a large client base
              that wishes to outsource its non-core competencies to an application service
              provider, while maintaining control of projects.  INSP greatly increases
              interaction between the client and contractor, thereby increasing the quality
              of the final seismic image, and reducing exploration and development cost.
