              VIGRE ABSTRACT
The Department of Mathematics of Indiana University will
              implement an integrated program of three-year postdoctoral fellowships,
              three-year graduate traineeships, and undergraduate research assistantships. 
              Graduate trainees and postdoctoral fellows will participate in special
              mentoring programs, both for teaching and for career development. Graduate
              trainees will also participate in a special jump-start summer program at the
              beginning of their traineeships.  Undergraduates will pursue research projects
              guided by faculty.  All participants will be involved in activities
              specifically aimed at enhancing their communication skills in a variety of
              contexts.  The development of interactions among the members of the different
              groups will be specifically encouraged.  The overall goal is to provide broad
              training at multiple levels for a successful career in the mathematical
              sciences, all within a context where mathematical research, education, and
              communication are enhanced.
