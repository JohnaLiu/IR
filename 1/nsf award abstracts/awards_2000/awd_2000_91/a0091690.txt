The Biomedical Engineering Alliance for Connecticut (BEACON)
              is presenting a Symposium on  Avances in Biodynamics and Ergonomics, October
              27, 2000. The several objectives of the meeting are to: 1) present insights
              into new research in Ergonomics and Biodynamics highlighting the important
              emerging roles for biomedical engineers, ergonomists, and health care workers
              2) present examples of successful academic/industrial collaborations in the
              areas of Ergonomics and Biodynamics, 3) provide information about funding
              opportunities, including those for academic-industrial collaborations in these
              areas, and 4) provide an opportunity for students from engineering, ergonomics,
              and the health sciences to learn about Ergonomics and Biodynamics.

It is
              anticipated that the convening of academic and industrial professionals from
              the various disciplines involved in Ergonomics and Biodynamics (e.g.
              engineering, ergonomics, medical science and health care) will facilitate
              interdisciplinary networking and collaborations that can enhance innovation in
              these areas. 

Results of the meeting will be disseminated on the BEACON WEB
              site (http://www.beaconalliance.org/) and in a printed publication for which
              funds are being provided by the National Science Foundation.
