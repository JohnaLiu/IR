Abstract    :
              0091655  Jahanian  The objective of this project is to develop a novel,
              economical and reusable permeable reactive barrier that effectively removes
              lead and mercury form contaminated water.  Specifically, the research will
              investigate the possibility of using permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) made
              with alkali activated fly ash (AAM).  The AAM, currently in the developmental
              stage, is a new and novel material made from fly ash in combination with sand,
              coarse aggregates, water, sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate and a foaming
              agent.  Preliminary results have demonstrated that an AAM PRB effectively
              removes cadmium and chromium from aqueous solution.  The purpose of this
              research is to determine whether such a barrier material will remove lead and
              mercury and to investigate the mechanisms and conditions of such removal. 
              Further studies will study the methods for recycling and reusing the barrier
              material.  If successful, the results of this project could lead to advances in
              the remediation of contaminated groundwaters, while at the same time, utilizing
              a resource that otherwise would be disposed of in landfills.***
