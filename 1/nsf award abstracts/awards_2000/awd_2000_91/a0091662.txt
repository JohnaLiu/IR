Abstract    :
              This project consists of all aspects of the annual evaluation of applications
              submitted to the Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
              program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences at NSF.  The
major steps of
              the evaluation process include the collection of applications materials during
              September and October, the processing and distribution of the application
              materials for review by a panel of 15 senior mathematical scientist, the
              arranging of a face-to-face meeting of the full panel in early December to
              evaluate the applications, and the reporting of the results of that evaluation
              to NSF before the end of December. Members of the panel are appointed by the
              presidents of the American Mathematical Society (AMS), the Institute of
              Mathematical Sciences and the Society of Industrial and Applied
              Mathematics.

This project is funded as a cooperative agreement between the
              NSF and the AMS for the period from 2001 through 2005.
