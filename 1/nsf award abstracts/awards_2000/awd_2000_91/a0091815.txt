Abstract    :
              Game theory provides the basis for rational behavior in situations involving
              multiple agents. It provides the means for modeling the objectives of agents
              and the information available to them, and specifies notions of optimal
              strategic behavior.  However, the practical use of game theory has hitherto
              been limited by the lack of efficient algorithms for computing optimal
              strategies, and of software tools for game analysis. In this project, several
              approaches are explored to develop effective game-theoretic solution
              algorithms. The approaches are unified in their use of structured
              representations. Similarities between game states are exploited by
              abstraction-based approximation methods; regularities in the creation and
              revelation of information are exploited by information-based decomposition
              methods; and the decomposition of a complex situation using a set of weakly
              interacting variables is exploited by factored representations. 

In addition
              to the new algorithms, software tools are developed for the representation,
              solution and analysis of games.  An innovative course on  computational game
              theory is also developed. The impact of these methods, tools and educational
              materials will be to transform game theory from a theoretic tool for analyzing
              prototypical situations to a practical tool for designing strategic agents for
              real-world problems.
