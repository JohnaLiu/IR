Studies of insect compound eye development have focussed
              in great detail on the model Drosophila melanogaster but very little is known
              about this process in other insect species. This is particularly notable as the
              eyes are formed during postembryogenesis from imaginal disc tissue in the
              holometabolous fruitfly Drosophila, whereas eye development initiates during
              early embryogenesis in most other animal species.  Drosophila eye development
              thus represents an evolutionarily highly derived process associated with an
              advanced form of insect metamorphosis. The PI has begun to study eye
              development in the more primitive grasshopper Schistocerca americana, which
              represents a hemimetabolous species with embryonic eye development. Comparing
              Drosophila with Schistocerca makes it possible to reconstruct the ancestral
              patterning mechanisms of insect eye development and to identify
              molecular-developmental changes associated with the evolution of insect
              metamorphosis. This proposal specifically addresses the roles of the wingless,
              decapentaplegic and hedgehog genes in the grasshopper eye. In Drosophila, these
              signaling factors orchestrate the global patterning of the eye field in a
              multitasking manner.  Gene expression pattern comparisons indicate that only
              some of the respective patterning functions are conserved while others are
              specific to either Drosophila
or Schistocerca.  The functional relevance of
              patterning gene expression in the grasshopper eye is being investigated by
              pharmacological and Sindbis virus mediated perturbation of gene activity in
              cultured embryos.
