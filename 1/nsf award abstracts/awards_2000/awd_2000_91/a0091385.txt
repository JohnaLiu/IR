Multiple Roles and Consequences of
              Intra-specific Chemical Variability


This project will explore the role of
              plant secondary compounds such as monoterpenes as important mediators of biotic
              interactions such as herbivory and competition.  The research will ask 1) can
              there be multiple consequences associated with synthesis and storage of a
              specific compound?  2) to what extent do results obtained in experiments apply
              to natural settings?  The plant to be studied is Thymus vulgaris, which is a
              plant with odor and taste primarily defined by one monoterpene.  In southern
              France, where much of the work is to be done, individuals belonging to one of
              six chemical phenotypes (or chemotypes) each has its own specific monoterpene.
              Terpene synthesis is under genetic control.  They chemotypes show variable
              deterrence against herbivores and influence germination and growth of
              competitiors differently.  Individuals of all six chemotypes will be exposed to
              herbivory, or competition, or a combination of both in experimental field work.
               The relative fitness of chemotypes will be studied.   Comparisons will be made
              of survival and reproduction in various environmental settings.
