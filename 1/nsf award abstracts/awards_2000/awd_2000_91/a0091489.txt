Digital Government:
              Integrating Metadata Development XML, and DBMS Search and Query Techniques in a
              State of Wisconsin Land Information System

This project will involve several
              state, local and national agencies in developing a query able database of
              heterogeneous spatial and textual data.  The data will continue to be held in
              various local and other databases, but will appear to be integrated though the
              system to be developed.  Automated development of Metada and semantic
              conversions will be required.  Three technical thrusts are i) to locate and
              search data sources, and to support user manipulation of the data.  XML will be
              an important technical tool in the project in expressing Metadata.
