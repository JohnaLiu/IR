Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is designed to
              develop and commercialize high-durability UV polarizer optics with
              unprecedented performance.  The breakthrough polarizers are made from stacks of
              oriented, birefringent thin film layers, which are obtained by vacuum
              deposition at an oblique angle.  The film material itself is optically
              isotropic, but the birefringence arises from the nanostructure of the layers in
              the film stack.  Films can be constructed from a single material, relieving the
              conventional constraints on material transparency and enabling a wider
              operating wavelength range. Using LiF as the film material, for example, could
              extend the operating range down to 110 nm.  Extension to the far UV and extreme
              UV appears possible with materials such as silicon carbide or boron carbide. 
              The deposition technique thus offers an exciting opportunity to engineer unique
              film properties.  In Phase II,  the investigator proposes to enlarge the
              database of film materials for UV chiral film polarizers and design, fabricate
              (using a customized deposition system), and characterize UV chiral film
              polarizers for practical applications.  The investigator will then develop
              high-speed deposition techniques to ensure the polarizers are low-cost. 
              Commercialization activities will accelerate in Phase III. 

The  inorganic
              UV polarizer films may have several advantages over conventional polarizer
              components, and become key devices in many important industrial manufacturing
              processes, including systems for chemical synthesis, drug development, and
              liquid crystal alignment for LCDs.
