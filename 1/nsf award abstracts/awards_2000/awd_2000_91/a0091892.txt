Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
              will acquire an LC Ion-Trap Mass Spectrometer for Interdisciplinary Chemical
              Analysis. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including
              a) the sequencing of peptides and characterization of synthetic small-molecule
              protein cofactors; b) separation and identification of oligonucleotides
              synthesized on clay; c) prostaglandin and leukotriene separations and
              identification of free radicals trapped with nitrone spin traps; d) analysis of
              lake and river surface microlayers; e) structural elucidation of combinatorial
              biocatalysts; and f) structure determination of photodegraded environmental
              pollutants.  

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate
              structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of
              organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The results from these
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including biotechnology and
              environmental chemistry.
