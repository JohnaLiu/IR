Recently, Dr. Harding's laboratory discovered a family of
              cell surface proteins called AT4 receptors.  These receptors appear to be
              important regulators of the fine structure and thus, the function of tissues
              and organs.  One such organ where the activation or blockade of AT4 appears to
              dramatically impact function is the brain.  Here it was found that compounds
              (developed in the Harding laboratory) that bind AT4 receptors can markedly
              alter learning efficiency, memory consolidation, and recall.  These findings
              correlate with the high concentration of AT4 receptors in the brain areas
              associated with cognitive function.  The goal of this project is to understand
              the mechanism by which AT4 receptor modulation influences cognitive function. 
              Specifically, the investigators wish to identify critical cellular processes
              and molecules that participate in AT4 receptor-dependent effects.  

The
              long-term goals of this project are twofold.  First, to clarify the basic
              mechanisms responsible for learning and memory development and to clarify how
              the AT4 receptor system fits into the big picture.  Second, we wish to identify
              likely processes and molecules that can contribute to cognitive dysfunction in
              diseases like Alzheimer's disease.  A corollary to this second goal is to
              determine whether drugs directed at AT4 receptors might serve as useful
              therapeutics in individuals with cognitive disorders.
