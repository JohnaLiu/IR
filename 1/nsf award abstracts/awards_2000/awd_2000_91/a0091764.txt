Abstract    :
              This Ethnographic Research Training award allows the department of anthropology
              at the University of Georgia to support students in fieldwork experience over a
              period of five years.  After a thorough course of training in theory, research
              design and methodology, focusing on ecological and environmental anthropology,
              students will be supported in pilot research before their dissertation research
              begins. This activity is important to improve the training of social
              scientists, so that the new cohort of social researchers will be capable of
              advancing our knowledge of contemporary problems as well as of basic research
              issues.
