This grant provides partial support of the costs of
              acquiring a multi-processor computer and workstations to set up an
              interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) processing facility for solid
              Earth geophysical research within UCLA's Earth and Space Sciences Department.
              The PI, Gilles Peltzer, is a recent addition to the ESS department faculty at
              UCLA, after having spent 10 years as a research scientist at the Jet Propulsion
              Laboratory. In addition to G. Peltzer's group including post-doctoral scholars
              and graduate students, the system will be used by a larger group of faculty
              including, but not limited to, Profs. J. Vidale, D. Jackson and collaborating
              scholars engaged in processing and analysis of massive data sets and
              CPU-intensive physical modeling.

The computer server will allow processing
              and analyses of large sets of InSAR data for research aimed at understanding
              sub-surface processes involved in the generation of earthquakes, the relaxation
              of the stress following these events, volcanic eruptions, and more surficial
              effects including the surface deformation produced by crustal fluid extraction
              and reinjection.  The observations made possible using InSAR (providing spatial
              continuity of sampling) ideally complement those made with permanent GPS arrays
              (temporal continuity).  The ability to rapidly analyze and interpret both sets
              of geophysical data will be immediately useful for geodetic and seismological
              research conducted by several scientists within the Earth and Space Science
              department of UCLA.
