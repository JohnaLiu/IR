Abstract    :
              Professor Tara Y. Meyer, Department of Chemistry, University of Pittsburgh, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for her project in
              catalyzed imine metathesis. Specifically, the project objectives will focus on
              (i) synthesizing second generation catalysts, (ii) on preparing a new class of
              imine metathesis catalysts based on phosphorous compounds, and (iii) on
              synthesizing new monomers.

Realization of the specific objectives will not
              only result in the preparation of new monomers, catalysts and polymers, but
              will also provide a greater understanding of the fundamental nature of
              metal-nitrogen bonding. This topic is central to a diverse range of
              applications including metal-nitride precursor synthesis, ammoxidation of
              propylene, nitrogen fixation and metal-catalyzed carbon-nitrogen formation in
              organic syntheses. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be mentored
              and will gain broad chemical skills in an area of organometallic catalysis so
              crucial to the well being of the nation's chemical industry.
