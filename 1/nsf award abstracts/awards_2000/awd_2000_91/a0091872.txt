Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University in New Brunswick
              will acquire a X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector. This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including the following: a)
              organo-lanthanum chemistry; b) solid state chemistry; c) biodegradable
              polymers; d) organometallic chemistry; e) studies of high-K dielectrics; and f)
              synthesis of complex nucleoside antibiotics.

The X-ray diffractometer allows
              accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a
              molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate
              information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
              neighboring molecules.  These studies will have an impact in a number of areas,
              including materials science and biotechnology.
