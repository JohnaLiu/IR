Biotic and industrial activities result in the
              environmental accumulation of organic toxins.  Cellular protection against such
               "xenobiotic stress" agents is afforded by increasing the rate of transcription
              of nuclear detoxification genes, through changes in the activity of
              basic/leucine-zipper (bZIP) transcription factors.  Key structural and
              regulatory features of xenobiotic-responsive bZIP factors of animals and yeast
              have been elucidated.  By comparison, less is known about their functional
              counterparts in plants.  The long-term goal of this research is to understand
              how transcription involving a tobacco bZIP factor termed TGA1a is regulated by
              cellular and stress cues.  Recently it has been shown that xenobiotic stress
              induced by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid can stimulate DNA-binding and
              trans-activation functions of TGA1a.  A nuclear TGA1a-binding protein termed
              p120, with properties of a co-repressor, is strongly implicated in
              stress-responsive regulation of these transcription activities.  The PI's
              laboratory will investigate the mode of action of the p120 co-repressor,
              through in vivo functional studies with its cloned gene.  TGA1a and its cognate
              as-1-type cis-elements have been implicated in the regulation of a number of
              plant detoxification and host-defense genes.  Thus, elucidating the molecular
              basis of this transcriptional response pathway is important for advancing basic
              knowledge of cellular detoxification processes, and for developing effective
              genetic strategies to manipulate natural protective genes of plants.  Because
              xenobiotic toxins accumulate in crop plants and retain significant latent
              activity, research aimed at understanding plant transcriptional control of
              detoxification pathways may have important implications for human health.
