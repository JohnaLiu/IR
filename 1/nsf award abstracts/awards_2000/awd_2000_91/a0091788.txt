Abstract    :
              Professor Royce Murray and his colleagues at the University of North
              Carolina-Chapel Hill are examining the chemistry and electrochemistry of metal
              nanoparticles containing a few hundred atoms and coated with a monolayer of
              thiolate ligands.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, this project focusses on the synthesis of these monolayer protected
              clusters, and their characterization using various chemical and electrochemical
              means. In addition, this group studies electron transfer dynamics in mixed
              valent molecular molten salts.  The goal of the work is to understand the basic
              properties of nanoparticulate matter and electron transfer dynamics in these
              systems and in the semi-solid molecular molten salts. 

The synthesis and
              characterization of a novel class of molecular nanoparticles is the goal of
              this research project at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. 
              Using thiolate ligands to protect metal particles of a few hundred atoms,
              materials that can be manipulated and characterized using electrochemical
              methods are being developed.  This research project also includes the study of
              electron transfer processes in mixed valent molecular molten salts.  Both
              aspects of the research are directed to a basic understanding of charge
              transfer in nanomaterials and solids.
