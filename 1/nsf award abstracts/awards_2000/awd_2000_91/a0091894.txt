Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of New Hampshire
              will acquire a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers
              to carry out studies on a) characterization of new cycloadducts of C60 with
              polyacenes and tetrazines; b) characterization and dynamic NMR studies of
              polyamines and derivatives, including compounds with strong potential as
              diagnostic imaging agents and anti-HIV agents; c) development of a novel zinc
              carbenoid chain extension reaction that will facilitate the inclusion of
              ketomethylene isosteres as part of combinatorial libraries; and d) studies of
              supramolecular clusters formed from hybrid ligands.   

Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
              unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
              who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
              have an impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry,
              biotechnology and nanotechnology.
