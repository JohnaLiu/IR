The Museum of Science in Boston is conducting a
              workshop/symposium that will focus on the question of how best to address the
              issue of enhancing public understanding of major, on-going research efforts. 
              The workshop will begin a critical discussion among researchers and some of the
              most prominent practitioners of informal public education in the areas of
              science, engineering and technology.  The discussion will explore possible
              directions that might be taken in regard to disseminating information about
              research to the public and in increasing the public's understanding of the role
              and possible implications of this research.  Issues to be examined include:


               The scope and aspects of research upon which to focus
  The present obstacles
              to public understanding
  The advantages and disadvantages of different
              approaches for disseminating information
  Costs and time frames of different
              approaches
  How to encourage and implement collaboration and networking among
              institutions that have the goal of               increasing public
              understanding.

The general goal of the workshop is twofold:  to provide
              feedback that will inform the creation of new programs to address the issue of
              enhancing public understanding of research and to share ideas among
              institutions that have a common purpose.
