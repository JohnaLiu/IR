Abstract    :
              Interest in computational cell biology has expanded in recent years.  A good
              indicator is the attendance at a workshop on the topic, at the Biophysical
              Society meeting last year, which drew 600 scientists.  In Japan, the E-CELL
              project is attempting to incorporate the entire genome of a unicellular
              organism into a model.  In contrast, this database emphasizes models as
              building blocks for understanding cell biological events.  Models are a
              collection of hypotheses and facts that are brought together in an attempt to
              understand a phenomenon.  VCELLDB, the Virtual Cell Database, will be a
              web-accessible electronic repository of physiological models. Built on a
              prototype that already includes intracellular calcium dynamics, nuclear
              envelope breakdown, mitochondrial respiration and RNA trafficking, employing
              easy-to-use interfaces, the expanded database would include computational and
              data resources, such as a thesaurus, links to other databases and built-in math
              functions so that scientists could create consistent models.  It will also have
              a community data curation feature that will permit the database to expand with
              a peer review mechanism, a sort of online publication mechanism that would lead
              to a self-sustaining public electronic model repository.
