Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Arkansas State University will
              acquire a high performance liquid chromatograph. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including a) characterization of bio-organic
              compounds in oxalate rock coatings; b) rare earth element geochemistry using
              capillary electrophoresis for environmental risk assessment studies; c)
              development of new post-column chromatographic methods for measuring chemical
              species in drinking and natural waters; and d) determination of the effects of
              phystoestrogens on mammalian reproduction.  

High performance liquid
              chromatography (HPLC) is an extremely powerful technique used for the
              separation and analysis of complex mixtures. The results from these studies
              will have an impact in a number of areas including geochemistry, environmental
              chemistry and biology.
