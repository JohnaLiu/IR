Abstract    :
              
The aim of the University of Utah VIGRE program is to quickly immerse
              undergraduate and graduate students in research, to provide effective
              mentorship for them and for postdoctoral instructors, and to foster interchange
              of ideas and expertise among all three groups and the faculty.

Its aim is
              for all to be prepared

1. in effective communication of the ideas and
              applications of mathematics in a range of contexts;
2. in depth to carry out
              work or research creatively and independently;
3. in breadth to interact with
              students or subordinates, with peers and with the public;
4. for leadership in
              a broad range of careers, inside or outside of academia.

The program will
              draw larger numbers of talented high school students into mathematics through a
              summer program which gives them early experience in learning by discovery;
              followed
by a challenging honors curriculum culminating in a senior research
              thesis supported by summer research programs. Graduate students will pursue a
              year-round program which ensures timely
completion of the degree through early
              immersion in research and seminars, summer workshops and tutorials, and close
              interaction with faculty and postdoctoral fellows. Postdoctoral fellows
play
              an active role in all phases of the program and work closely with faculty
              mentors
