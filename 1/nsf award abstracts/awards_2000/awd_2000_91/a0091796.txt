This award supports research with the goal of determining the
              optimum conditions for secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) studies of
              geological materials. This goal will be accomplished by 1) measuring the
              sputter yield (atoms removed/primary ions striking the sample) of silicate
              glass bombarded by primary ion beams of O2-, O-, K+, and Cs+ at impact energies
              ranging from ~22.5 to ~5 keV and 2) measuring the useful yields (ions
              detected/atoms sputtered) of ~60 trace elements in silicate glass with the
              different primary species and impact energies, Additional samples (sulfides and
              glasses implanted with platinum group elements and hydrogen, respectively) will
              also be studied. These fundamental data will be recast into a general "handbook
              of optimum analysis conditions" and will allow researchers applying SIMS to
              problems in trace element and isotope ratio microanalysis to get the highest
              sensitivity at the lowest cost in terms of sample consumption.
