TITLE: Dynamic and Randomized Load Distribution
              for Tree-Structured
        Parallel Computations on Static Interconnection
              Networks
PI:    Keqin Li

This three-year project will investigate the
              performance of the class
of random-walk-based algorithms for dynamic tree
              embedding to support
tree-structured parallel computations on various static
              networks.
The research will be conducted within the framework of the product
              of four
spaces, namely, the embedding algorithm space, the tree model
              space,
the static network space, and the performance measure space.
The
              overall research objective is to thoroughly investigate and understand
the
              behavior of randomized tree embedding produced by random-walk-based
algorithms
              in static networks to the largest extent.
The methods include devising
              embedding algorithms, proposing random
tree models, developing analytical
              tools, formulating mathematical equations,
generating numerical data,
              observing and proving general properties,
and simulating dynamic
              embedding.
The project is motivated by the fact that there are a wide spectrum
              of
tree-structured applications in computer science and engineering
and the
              wide availability of distributed memory multicomputers
with static
              interconnection networks.
The significance of the project is reflected by its
              wide coverage of
various randomized tree embedding algorithms, a number of
              deterministic
and probabilistic tree models, a wide range of static
              interconnection
networks, and different performance measures.
Algorithms and
              methods obtained from this project will be readily used
to support dynamic
              load distribution for tree-structured parallel and
distributed computing, and
              will have great impact on various applications
on a variety of multicomputers
              and distributed systems.
