Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II Project aims to develop
              novel nano-layered coatings for high-temperature tribological applications,
              specifically cutting-tool coatings that perform well at elevated temperatures
              (up to 1000 degrees C).  There is a high level of interest in these coatings
              because of the desire to cut at higher rates and due to increasing
              environmental concerns over the use of coolants during machining. Traditional
              coating materials do not perform well under these conditions, primarily because
              their hardnesses decrease rapidly as temperature rises.  Research in Phase I
              developed a new class of coatings, combining many alternating nanometer-thick
              layers of metals and nitrides, which show substantial hardness enhancements.
              Hardnesses up to 44 gigapascals (GPa) were maintained after high temperature
              annealing, demonstrating the feasibility of these new materials as
              high-temperature stable coatings. Strong dislocation confinement in nano-layers
              is likely to yield higher high-temperature hardness than in monolithic
              coatings, providing improved wear resistance. In Phase II, nano-layered
              coatings will be developed that optimize key properties including hardness,
              thermal expansion match with the substrate, stability against dissolution into
              different workpieces, and oxidation resistance. 

Nano-layered coated cutting
              tools have the potential to make dry-cutting a practical alternative, and to
              improve wet-machining performance.
