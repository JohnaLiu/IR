Abstract    :
              This award supports the development and flight of four balloon payloads over
              mesoscale convective complexes located in the central region of South America. 
              The purpose of these flights conducted through the support of the Brazilian
              balloon launch facilities is to obtain measurements pertaining to the
              production of Bremstralung X-rays that might be produced in the course of
              sprite events.  Detection of these X-rays would determine the importance of
              runaway electrons in the development of sprite emissions, a basic assumption in
              current models that has not been verified through measurements.  Additional
              balloon measurements would acquire a determination of the background
              distribution of vector electric and magnetic field distribution generated by
              the thunderstorm activity.  Optical documentation of sprite events would be
              achieved through the application of high speed optical imaging of sprite
              emissions that would be flown on a Brazilian aircraft that will be located some
              50 to 200 kms away from the thunderstorm activity.  These results would be
              compared with model predictions of sprite events as revised to correspond to
              the electrical characteristics of the storm observed.
