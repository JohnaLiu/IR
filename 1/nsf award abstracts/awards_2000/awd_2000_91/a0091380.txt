Abstract    :
              This starter grant is awarded by the Chemistry Division to Georgia Tech in
              support of the research of Charles D. Sherrill.  Ab initio electronic structure
              methods will be used to provide a more detailed and quantitative understanding
              of the photophysics of heteroaromatic complexes of Cu(I) which have potential
              roles in energy conversion applications and as analytic probes. Geometrical
              relaxation and electronic distribution in the excited state will be elucidated.
