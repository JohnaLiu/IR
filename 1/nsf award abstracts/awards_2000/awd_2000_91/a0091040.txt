Abstract    :
              This project will examine the molecular basis of variation in muscle contractile
              performance in a model organism, the dragonfly, and will assess the impact of
              such variation on the organism's ecological success. One primary focus is to
              determine how variation created by alternative splicing of genes at the RNA
              level affects performance at the cellular, tissue, and whole-organism levels.
              Knowledge of these mechanistic pathways will be used to determine how muscle
              performance is adjusted in response to environmental variation, and to the
              presence of gregarine parasites that infect the gut and reduce energy intake. 
              Further, differential effects of the resultant muscle performance on flight
              performance will be assessed, and, in turn, effects of flight performance on
              male mating success and the ability of males to defend desirable territories
              will be assessed.  Together, these results will greatly enhance our knowledge
              of mechanisms that create variation in muscle and locomotor performance, and
              the ecological context in which these mechanisms operate.
