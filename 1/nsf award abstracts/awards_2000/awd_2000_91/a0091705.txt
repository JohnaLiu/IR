Abstract    :
              Currently available instrumented bioreactors are expensive and bulky, thus
              making bioprocess development inefficient, as large numbers of simultaneous
              experiments simply cannot be conducted. The project objectives are to construct
              a low-cost instrumented micro-bioreactor and to demonstrate the feasibility of
              constructing a small-scale research module using optical sensor technology. The
              proposed work aims to extend the micro-bioreactor scale down to 250 microliters
              working volume in a 96 well microplate platform so that 96 fermentations can be
              carried out and monitored simultaneously. The PI proposes to design and
              construct such a device that will enable parallel monitoring and analyses of
              large number of fermentation and cell culture parameters. They anticipate that
              at about the cost of a bench top bioreactor ($20,000) they will be able to
              construct the instrumented micro-bioreactor platform. It is anticipated that
              the impact of this proposed work would be significant. This research result
              will remove a major bottleneck in bioprocess development and allow for much
              speedier and efficient optimization of fermentation and cell culture
              processes.
