Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              novel nano-structured solvent free polymer electrolytes for solid state Li-ion
              batteries.  The important characteristics of these electrolytes are that they
              are of high ionic conductivity and have excellent mechanical strength.  The
              combination of these properties results from an ordered structure on the
              nanometer scale, consisting of a co-continuous network of an epoxy scaffold and
              a polymer electrolyte. This unique structure is obtained by self-assembly
              during curing of the epoxy in the presence of a partially emersiable block
              copolymer containing the ion-conducting phase.  Polymer electrolyte batteries
              based on the new electrolytes promise great configuration flexibility in design
              and substantially increased energy density. 

The new polymer electrolytes
              will permit fabrication of high performance Li- ion batteries for use in
              portable consumer products such as cellular telephones, portable power tools,
              video cameras and laptop computers.  Other applications include "dye sensitized
              solar cells", and electrochromic devices.
