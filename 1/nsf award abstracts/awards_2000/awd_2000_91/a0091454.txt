Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              prototype high speed, non-invasive, optical probe for electric fields, and
              hence waveforms, in semiconductor devices.  The technique is designed to work
              on any semiconductor regardless of its crystal structure and can be used for
              both imaging and single point detection without degradation of temporal
              resolution.  Because the technique is optically based, no parasitic capacitance
              is added to the device being measured.  A femtosecond laser probes the device
              to be measured, and temporal resolution is several orders of magnitude faster
              than the time resolution required to probe present devices.  Bandwidths of
              greater than 10 terahertz should be possible.

This non-invasive probe
              technique will be applied to silicon-based devices.  In their production and
              testing in the semiconductor industry.
