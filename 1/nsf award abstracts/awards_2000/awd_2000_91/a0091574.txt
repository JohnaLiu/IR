Abstract    :
              This  CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to
              analyze, through six unique surveys (i.e. alumni, recent graduates, enrolled,
              changed to a non-IT program, stopped-or dropped-out), the environmental,
              educational, and workforce issues faced by over 8,500 adult females and 8,900
              minority students.  The goal of this research is to obtain an understanding of
              the backgrounds, motivations, preferences and support systems that adult women
              and minority IT students express upon entrance and exit from a non-tradional
              university.  This project has the potential to provide valuable insight about
              how to educate and provide support services to women and underrepresented
              groups who are interested in pursuing IT careers.
