Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Duke University will  acquire a
              time-resolved, step-scan Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer.  This
              instrument will support research in a number of areas, including a)
              characterization of the intermediates in the photoreactions of melanins; b)
              electron distribution in MLCT states and photo dynamics of heme proteins; c)
              excited state electronic structure of novel ruthenium (II) complexes used for
              probing DNA electron transfer; d) investigation of second-coordination shell
              dynamics in iron (III)-siderophore chelation reactions; e) evaluation of the
              formal redox state of nitric oxide in s-nitrosated hemoglobins; and f) protein
              folding dynamics.  

The general effectiveness of Fourier transform
              spectroscopic techniques in academic and industrial research has been firmly
              established.  Many advanced spectroscopic courses now routinely include the
              teaching of FT spectroscopy.  The time-resolved capability is one of the most
              important recent developments in FT spectroscopy that is rapidly being explored
              for all kinds of research.  Recent applications include biological, polymer,
              and environmental studies.  These studies will have an impact in a number of
              areas, especially biochemistry.
