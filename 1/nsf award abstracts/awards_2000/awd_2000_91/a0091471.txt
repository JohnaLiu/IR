Abstract    :
              This award provides renewed support of the Arabidopsis Biological Resource
              Center (ABRC).  The Center collects, preserves, reproduces and distributes
              diverse seed and DNA stocks of the flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana.  The
              ABRC provides access to lists of its stocks and other materials online, and
              uses a forms-based online ordering system to minimize the difficulty of
              identifying and ordering seeds and DNA reagents. 

Since the ABRC was
              established in 1991, Arabidopsis has become the model species of  choice for
              basic studies of flowering plants. The ABRC serves a dynamic community of plant
              researchers involved in cutting-edge biology that impacts  the fundamental
              understanding of the basic functioning of plants as well as applied research
              aimed at crop improvement. The value of the collection has been enhanced by the
              recent completion of the sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome, and demand for
              the services of the ABRC is expected to grow as interest in functional genomics
              increases.

On an annual basis, the Center currently distributes 
              approximately 50,000 seed and 20,000 DNA stocks to over 7,000 scientists
              worldwide.  This award will provide 70% of the ABRC's operating budget, with
              the remainder coming from institutional funds and user fees.
