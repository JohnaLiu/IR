Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is directed at
              improving the capabilities of high resolution x-ray imaging systems.  The
              enabling technology in this approach is a novel x-ray detector formed from
              transparent scintillation crystals. A prototype developed in Phase I
              demonstrates a spatial resolution of six microns.  This surpasses the
              resolution of commercial systems based on microfocus x-ray sources, and is 4-6
              times better than current x-ray detectors.  Based on these results it is
              anticipated that a resolution of 1-2 microns can be achieved in Phase II.  If
              fully successful, the end result of Phase II will be a commercialized x-ray
              microscope with five to ten times the resolution of existing
              products.

High-resolution x-ray imaging is used in many fields, including
              manufacturing, medicine, and scientific research.  The product developed in
              Phase II will have better technical performance and be lower in cost that
              presently available systems.
