Abstract    :
              With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic
              Dynamics Program supports the research of Dr. Dale F. Shellhamer of the
              Department of Chemistry at Point Loma Nazarene College. Professor Shellhamer
              explores the reaction conditions required to cause an ionic reaction of
              halogens, interhalogens and other halogen systems with various unreactive
              terminal perfluoroalkenes. A thorough understanding of addition reactions to
              perfluoroalkenes and perfluorohydrocarbons alkenes is necessary for the
              development of new polymerization processes and synthesis of new monomers.This
              study is designed to supply data that will provide a thorough understanding of
              halonium ions derived from a variety of substituted terminal perfluoroalkenes.
              The relative symmetry of the halonium ions in a series of substituted
              perfluoroalkenes will be compared to related data reported for halonium ions of
              analogous hydrocarbons.

The applications of fluoropolymers cover broad areas
              such as: water, fuel and oil repellency, thermal stability, resistance to
              chemicals, UV radiation and weathering, and lubricants with a low coeffficient
              of friction retaining high thermal stability. The advantages of those materials
              offset the disadvantage of high unit cost. The research is designed to enhance
              the understanding of the reactions of fundamental fluorine chemistry which
              should have applications in many commercial processes. This project is well
              suited for undergraduates. They will carry out syntheses and use modern
              instruments to characterize a large number of compounds generated from this
              study. Students are encouraged to suggest mechanistic interpretations of the
              experimental data and to propose control experiments to confirm an ionic
              pathway and ensure that kinetic products are being reported. The undergraduate
              research program at Point Loma Nazarene College also serves as a recruitment
              tool for outstanding high school students interested in various branches of
              science.
