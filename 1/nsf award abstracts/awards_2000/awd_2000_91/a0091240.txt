Vision begins with
              the absorption of light by photoreceptors, which is followed by extensive
              processing of visual signals by cells within the retina.  This cellular
              processing is absolutely essential for normal visual perception to take place. 
              The molecular mechanisms responsible for such processing in the outer retina
              remain unclear, but it has been suggested that hydrogen ions and nitric oxide
              may play important roles in this process.  The current proposal seeks to use
              newly-developed self-referencing electrodes, with greatly heightened
              sensitivity and stability, to measure the release of these substances from
              retinal cells and to study their modulation.  This work will provide much
              needed information on the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms used by
              retinal cells to contribute to normal vision, and will provide a groundwork to
              understand abnormalities in vision that occur when these processes fail to
              function normally.  This work will also offer training opportunities for
              students, including women and minorities, at the graduate and undergraduate
              level, to learn about newly developed experimental methods employed in the
              study of sensory processing.
