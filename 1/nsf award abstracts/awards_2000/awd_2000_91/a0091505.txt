              Dissemination to Multiple Audiences

In this project, computer and social
              scientist will collaborate with the city of Troy, NY.  The focus will be on
              youth service educational and non-profit organizations to develop community
              information systems relevant to the topic area.  Many sectors (youth,
              education, government, non-profit) will be involved in the project.

A
              software package named CIRCLE will be developed to enable design, authoring and
              maintenance of multimedia applications by multiple and non-technical content
              developers and user groups.  Various focus groups will be used to test CIRCLE's
              abilities and potential.  In addition to computer science, an important
              research element will be to study the social processes associated with the
              construction and use of information systems for community audiences.
