Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Seton Hall University will
              acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
              carry out studies on a) proteins and peptides in a bicontinuous lipidic cubic
              phase; b) synthesis of novel dendritic and hyperbranched polymers; c)
              preparation of new materials for microlithography; d) synthetic carbohydrate
              chemistry; e) conformational analysis of polysaccharides; and f) interactions
              of fluoropeptides with DNA.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
              is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
              structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
              characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
              dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
              frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a
              number of areas including materials chemistry and biochemistry.
