Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois in Chicago
              will acquire a Stopped-Flow Equipped Circular Dichroism Spectrometer. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) studies on
              folding kinetics of designed peptides that form beta sheets in solution; b)
              fast folding events in secondary and tertiary structure formation of RNA; c)
              studies of sequence dependent context effects in duplex DNA; d) chemical
              biology studies of novel protease mechanisms; and e) protein and peptide
              folding and conformational studies.  

Circular dichroism spectroscopy is an
              extremely useful tool in modern analytical chemistry.  It provides a very
              reliable and sensitive method for assigning absolute molecular configurations. 
              The results from these studies will have an impact in a number of areas,
              especially biochemistry.
