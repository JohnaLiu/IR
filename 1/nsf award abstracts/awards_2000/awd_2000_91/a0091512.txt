Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will
              develop optical sensors, called optrodes, and their systems for monitoring
              environmental water quality.  Phase I research demonstrated the ability of
              optrodes to gather long-term environmental water quality data in harsh 
              environments.  Phase II technical issues are concerned with:  (1) analyte
              specific probe chemistries; (2) optical coatings; and (3) optical
              configurations.  With respect to systems, Phase I found lifetime phase-base
              measurement systems superior to traditional intensity-based systems.  Phase II
              will develop an integrated phase-based analyzer capable of:  (1) resolving
              dissolved oxygen, dissolved carbon dioxide, acidity, and temperature; and (2)
              transmission by remote data telemetry.

These innovations in optrode
              technology will:  (1) improve mapping of geophysical fields; (2) substantially
              reduce direct labor costs associated with conventional monitoring technologies;
              (3) produce robust data for enhanced modeling capabilities; and (4) enable
              other technology for protecting natural resources.
