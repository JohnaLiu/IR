Abstract    :
              Professor Philip Reid of University of Washington is funded by the Experimental
              Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental studies on the effects of
              solvent on chemical reactions relevant to the environment.   Halooxide
              photochemistry is important in the atmosphere; while the gas phase
              photoreactivity has been well studied in the laboratory, not much is known
              about photoreactivity of these compounds in the condensed phase (e.g. rain
              droplets).  The PI proposes to continue detailed studies on OClO photochemistry
              in both gas and condensed phases using resonance Raman spectroscopy (intensity
              and time-resolved) as well as femtosecond pump-probe measurements.  The PI then
              proposes to study ClOCl, nitrosyl halides and alkyl nitrates in a similar
              manner to establish general trends in these systems.  

 A successful outcome
              of this proposal would be a model for the prediction of solvent effects on the
              photoreactivity of small molecules. The proposed work is especially timely
              because of recognition by atmospheric chemists that heterogeneous reactions can
              contribute significantly to overall processes, and therefore must be included
              in models of the atmosphere.
