TITLE:  Digital Government: 
              Digitalization of Coastal Management and Decision-Making Supported by
              Multi-dimensional Geospatial Information and  Analysis

With the continuing
              trend of increasing population and economic activities in the coastal zone, a
              sustainable coastal environment is crucial to the well being of human,
              wildlife, and properties in the zone.    Recently, the coastal zone has been
              directly or indirectly affected by a series of problems such as global warming,
              climate change, seal level raising, coastal erosion, environmental
              contamination, and overpopulation.  Coastal management and decision-making
              involve extremely comprehensive and critical operations across multiple
              governmental organizations, where the above problems and impacts have to be
              dealt with.  Geospatial information and analysis can be used to coordinate and
              support multi-agency operations include a) federal government: coastal erosion
              monitoring, coastal resource management, coastal forecasting, coastal
              development permission, and residential erosion awareness and watching system. 
              The goal of this research is to investigate and develop technologies that will
              greatly enhance operation capabilities of federal, state, and local government
              agencies for coastal  management and decision-making using multiple spaceborne,
              airborne, and in situ remotely-sensed measurements, spatio-temporal databases,
              and geospatial analysis tools.

The objectives of this research project
              are:
a) develop a strategy and technologies for utilizing geospatial
              information of all level of government agencies in coastal management and
              decision-making.
b) develop and integrate technologies of space- and airborne
              and insitu spatial data acquisition, spatio-temporal data modeling and
              analysis, hydrological modeling and forecasting, and web-based information
              systems for digital government operations,
c) develop and test an integrated
              coastal management and decision-making system that incorporates the spatial
              analysis and hydrological modeling technologies that will examine historical
              coastal environment and future changes  based on desired or proposed
              scenarios,
d) test and implement the above strategy and the system to
              demonstrate the significantly improved interagency operations of coastal
              decision-making through a pilot  project in the primary site in Lake Erie area
              and another test site in the Tampa Bay area, and
e) disseminate coastal
              geospatial data and coastal erosion information to end users including coastal
              residents in erosion areas and to assist them in making their decisions such as
              property protection measures, property purchasing/selling, and small community
              planning activities.

If successfully implemented, this project will
              significantly enhance our capability of handling spatio-temporal coastal
              databases, build a fundamental basis of coastal geospatial information for
              inter-governmental agency operations, and provide innovative tools for all
              levels of governmental agencies to improve efficiency and reduce operational
              costs.
