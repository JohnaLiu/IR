Digital Government: Scalable
              Data Collection Infrastructure for Digital Government Applications


This
              project in collaboration with the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of
              Justice, and the US Census Bureau will explore the collection of data over
              wide-area networks.  Of particular interest are situations with high submission
              volume from a variety of sites to one agency (hot spots); e.g. the submission
              of electronic tax forms to IRS in the April 14-14 timeframe.  Within that
              context, research issues will include scalability, and privacy/integrity. 
              Other possible government applications include submissions of proposals at
              deadlines, such as the NSF Fastlane system, and voting in digital democracy. 
              The technology to be developed will work at the application layer of TCP/IP,
              implementing a small set of primitive services.
