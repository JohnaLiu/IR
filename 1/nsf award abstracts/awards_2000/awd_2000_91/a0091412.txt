Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will create
              web-based courseware featuring software (the "Urn Sampler") built around the
              simulation/resampling method in statistics which focuses on the process of
              formulating a statistical test.  This courseware will also feature a statistics
              text (Statistics: Making Sense of Data by Stout, Marden and Travers),
              self-assessment tools, a "Virtual Professor" help system, a "Virtual Statistics
              Consulting Lab," and entry-level spreadsheet-based statistical software.  The
              target market is students in introductory statistics courses, who will purchase
              the product just as they now purchase texts.  The courseware aims to leverage
              the latest and most standard web technologies that are anticipated to be in
              place at the conclusion of the project's development phase.

The plan
              combines the power of a web-based  structure with the new resampling techniques
              to create a unique learning environment for statistics students.  The Urn
              Sampler will be an open and flexible lab tool that will let teachers create
              exercises to supplement class lectures and other course materials.  It will
              make it easy to teach the new compute-intensive resampling methods that have
              proven successful in teaching statistical inference.  It addresses a diverse
              audience, including undergraduate and graduate students taking a required
              course in quantitative reasoning or statistics, students taking an
              undergraduate major or minor in statistics, and graduate students studying
              statistics and continuing education students.  Additional product sales will
              come through purchases of parts of the web product by students whose
              instructors have adopted a text other than the Stout, et al. text.
