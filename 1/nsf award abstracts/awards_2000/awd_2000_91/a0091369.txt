Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the
              development and optimization of a continuous, easily scalable and economical
              synthesis of reactive nanoparticles (RNPs); characterization and control of
              physical and chemical properties of these materials; development of flexible
              synthesis approaches for production of complex nanoparticle metal oxides;  and
              identification and establishment of quality control procedures. This effort is
              critically needed in order to develop commercially viable nanomaterials for
              applications in both civilian and military markets.  As demonstrated during the
              Phase I research, nanomaterials, produced using the proprietary continuous
              process, possess the same chemical and physical properties as those prepared in
              a batchwise mode.  

The research is broad and spans a number of significant
              markets including decontamination technologies for military and civilian
              applications, improved catalysts and catalytic supports, industrial gas
              scrubbing, and active ingredients for high efficiency air and water
              purification systems.  Each of these market applications represents an initial
              subset of the market opportunities for these highly reactive nanomaterials.
