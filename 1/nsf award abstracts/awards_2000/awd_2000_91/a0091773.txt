Abstract    :
              In the last few years a greater emphasis on causality has enhanced the
              expressiveness of logic-based action representations.   An example of this is
              the "causal theories" formalism of McCain and Turner, which can be used to
              conveniently describe action domains in which:   (a) actions have indirect,
              nondeterministic, and/or delayed effects;   (b) things change by themselves;  
              and (c) concurrent actions have interacting effects.   Although causal theories
              are nonmonotonic, they are mathematically simple.   In fact, in their most
              commonly used form they have a concise translation into classical propositional
              logic.   This last fact is particularly significant in light of the remarkable
              success of the satisfiability planning method of Kautz and Selman, which has
              greatly influenced recent AI planning research.  While most current work on
              satisfiability planning involves propositional encodings of STRIPS-like action
              descriptions, the expressiveness of causal theories will support satisfiability
              planning in relatively complex action domains.    For example, there has been
              little progress in AI planning for action domains in which concurrently
              executed actions may have interacting effects.   Causal theories can be used to
              describe them, and the resulting descriptions can be used for planning by the
              satisfiability method.   A unifying goal of the current research is to broaden
              the applicability of AI planning by means of contributions in the following
              areas:  (a) mathematics of causal theories and related formalisms;   (b)
              representations of complex action domains as causal theories;   and (c)
              automated planning and reasoning about actions.
