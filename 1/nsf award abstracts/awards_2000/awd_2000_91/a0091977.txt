Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York
              in Buffalo will acquire a High Resolution Mass Spectrometer with HPLC. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) the synthesis
              and development of new catalytic methods; b) development of hydrogen-bonded
              molecular duplexes with sequence-specificity and adjustable stability; c)
              design of catalysts for hydrolytic cleavage of nucleid acids; and d) studies of
              the structure and function of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase ribozyme.  

Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
              to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
              and organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including biochemistry and development of catalysts
              for industrial processes.
