Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Commonwealth University
              will acquire an Electrospray Ionization Quadrupole Time-of-Flight  Mass
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including a) electron transfer reactions between cytochrome c, cytochrome c
              oxidase and dioxygen; b) characterization of chemical dynamics in complex
              systems; c) biomimetic-supported catalysts for oxygen- and peroxide-dependent
              oxidations; d) assessment of antibody-based sensors for trace analysis of
              environmental contaminants; e) lanthanide(III) macrocyclic complexes as
              luminescent bio-markers; and f) resonance Raman of oxidized peroxidases. 
              

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural
              details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic,
              bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will
              have an impact in a number of areas including environmental chemistry and
              biochemistry.
