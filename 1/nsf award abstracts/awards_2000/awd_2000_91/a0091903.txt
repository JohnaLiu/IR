Abstract    :
              This project studies the influence of culture on individual adaptation
through
              investigating cultural, social-psychological and dietary influences
on
              individual differences in physiological and psychological
              adaptation.
Individual differences in variables such as blood pressure, serum
              lipids,
anxiety and depression have most often been attributed to
              individual-level
factors such as diet or stressful experiences.  This project
              will use
contemporary culture theory and methods to examine how cultural
              models
construct shared meanings, which in turn affect the behavior of
              individuals
and their health status.  The research hypothesizes that high
              cultural
consonance, the degree to which individuals approximate shared
              cultural
models, will be associated with better physiological and
              psychological
adaptation, as measured by lower blood pressure and other
              variables
associated with stress and distress.  The research will be done in
              Ribeirao
Preto, Brazil, a community with a considerable amount of
              socio-cultural and
dietary variability.  The research will take place in four
              diverse
neighborhoods in three stages: unstructured interviewing will be used
              to
elicit cultural domains; then cultural consensus analysis will be used
              to
test for shared knowledge; and finally data on individual
              psycho-biological
adaptation will be collected from a survey sample.  The
              research will
contribute to our understanding of how individuals adapt in
              their cultural
setting as well as advance our knowledge of this important
              region of the
world.
