Abstract    :
              The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) hosts a workshop on U.S.-Australia
              Interactions in Biological Informatics to take place on July 10-12th at the
              ATCC Headquarters in Manassas, Virginia.

This workshop, jointly sponsored by
              the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Australian Academy of Science,
              convenes a panel of about forty biologists and computer scientists to discuss
              enhancement of U.S.-Australian collaborations in four major focus areas:

1.
              Microarray (biochip expression data informatics)
2. Large DNA databases
3.
              Automated identification of organisms
4. Biodiversity legacy data from
              biological collections

It is expected that this meeting will foster research
              information exchange, development of new applications and lead to new
              collaborative research.
