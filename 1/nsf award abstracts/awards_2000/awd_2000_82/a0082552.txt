Abstract    :
              The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is a software package for data processing and
              visualization and is used by several thousand scientists in both the U.S. and
              aboard.  To improve both stability and functionality of the package, the GMT
              development team will be expanded by allowing volunteers to make conributions
              in several key areas.
