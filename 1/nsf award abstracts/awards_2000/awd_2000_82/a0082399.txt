Abstract    :
              Storage systems have evolved from small disk systems under control of a file
              server to large, independent disk and disk-array systems that can be directly
              accessed by applications. It is becoming increasingly difficult for system
              administrators to manage these complex storage systems manually. This work
              addresses this problem by proposing to develop smart storage systems that
              perform complex tasks like configuration, capacity planning, fault management,
              and load balancing in addition to routine tasks like data storage and retrieval
              and data backups. The automated storage system adapts to changes in the
              workload and system configuration without human intervention. The storage
              management software uses device and workload models to compute the optimum
              data-to-device mapping. These models are embedded inside the storage management
              software that is developed using constraint satisfaction programming
              techniques. The main contribution of the proposed work is the development of
              workload-aware and system-aware storage techniques that significantly improve
              system performance and ease storage data management.
