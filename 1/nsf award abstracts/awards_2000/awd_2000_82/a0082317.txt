              ABSTRACT

OCE-0082317
 

Understanding the magnitude and variation of the
              deposition and partial dissolution of atmospheric dust in the surface ocean is
              important because it represents a largely unquantified link in the geochemical
              cycle of reactive trace metals and may contribute significant amounts of
              biologically active elements.  For this reason, the principal investigators
              plan to collect aerosols over a seasonal cycle from the atmospheric sampling
              facility at Bellows Air Force Base on Oahu, Hawaii and subject them to a series
              of dissolution experiments to determine the fractional solubility of Al, Fe and
              Co in aqueous matrices mimicking rain and surface seawater.  Results of the
              dissolution experiments will be compared to the concentration of the same
              dissolved trace elements in rain water collected at the same site to establish
              the validity of using aerosol suspensions as a means of estimating dust
              solubility.   This study will provide a comprehensive assessment of the
              fractional solubility of biologically important trace elements from atmospheric
              aerosols during a seasonal cycle and ascertain the factors that control it.  In
              addition, the aerosol project also will elucidate the role that dust deposition
              of potentially limiting micronutrients to the surface ocean play in promoting
              biological processes and how past changes in atmospheric dust loadings may have
              affected surface water biogeochemical fluxes including carbon.
