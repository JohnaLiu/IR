Abstract    :
              The PI has previously developed several variants of a new statistical framework
              based on the principle of maximum entropy (ME) for learning the joint
              probability mass function associated with a discrete (possibly
              high-dimensional) feature space.   Although excellent results which surpass
              those attainable with competing approaches have been obtained, the PI is
              currently limited to handling small-to-intermediate feature spaces (up to 30
              dimensions), and has only considered artificial general inference problems. 
              The main objective in this project is to develop a large-scale extension of the
              new methods capable of handling hundreds, or even thousands, rather than tens
              of features, and to then apply the approach to emerging domains such as
              multiple topic retrieval from document databases and collaborative filtering.  
               Applications to diagnosis and marketing will also be explored.    Successful
              completion of this work will result in a practical set of ME tools that
              outperform existing methods and thus have a significant impact on large-scale
              inference tasks.   The work will also develop principled methods within the ME
              framework for treating mixed continuous/categorical data and arbitrary patterns
              of missing features.   By attacking large-scale problems, heterogeneous data,
              and missing features, the work addresses some key challenges encountered in
              machine learning in practice.
