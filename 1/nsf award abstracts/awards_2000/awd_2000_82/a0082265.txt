Abstract    :
              Abstract

The objective is to improve the reliability of software produced
              by
end-user programming languages in general, and by spreadsheet
languages in
              particular.  The approach is to address software
engineering issues as an
              integrated whole in ways that incrementally
interact with each other and with
              the user.  For example, the system
will notice the user's reactions to sample
              values she tests, and will
then suggest general principles about the
              spreadsheet, encouraging the
user to refine or modify the suggestions.  This
              collaboration between
the system and user will incrementally generate formal
              specifications
as the spreadsheet evolves.  These specifications can in turn
              be fed
back to enhance reliability -- by automatically suggesting
              appropriate
test values, by helping locate faults, and by ensuring
              continuing
consistency with the specifications.  The research involves
              three
facets: developing an interactive mechanism for
              user-system
collaboration, developing algorithms for the system's part of
              the
collaboration, and conducting experiments to evaluate effectiveness.
This
              is the first research attempting to bring fundamental software
engineering
              principles to bear on end-user programming.  Since the use
of end-user-written
              programs and spreadsheets is very widespread and
their lack of reliability is
              pervasive, improved reliability will
impact a potentially huge number of
              business and personal computer
users.
