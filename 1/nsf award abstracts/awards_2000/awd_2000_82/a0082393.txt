ITR: Groupware-Mediated
              Cooperative Programming: Teaching Web
Technology to Non-Scientists

One
              consequence of the rapid growth of the Internet is the corresponding
rapid
              increase in the demand for teams of software and Web site developers
to
              support the creation of Web content and services.  Complicating matters
is the
              need to train large numbers of workers with non-technical
backgrounds for the
              growing electronic workplace.  This research explores
groupware-mediated
              cooperative tools to teach IT skills to novices.  A same
time/different place
              groupware system will be built, deployed, and
experimentally tested that
              supports collaborative learning of Web
development and applet programming for
              a computer science general service
course serving social science, humanities,
              and fine arts students.
