Abstract    :
              Considerable information is known to exist in the form of "soft" information
              such as the hunches, opinions, beliefs and expectations distributed across many
              individuals.  When individuals are differentially located in time and space and
              receive signals in the form of complex patterns from a common source, such
              information can aggregate into a reliable statistic.  Tools for extracting such
              information, called Information Aggregation Mechanisms (IAMs), have evolved
              naturally but the scientific foundation for their successes has not been
              explored.  IAMs involve subtleties because they depend upon incentives and the
              ability of individuals to update their opinions/beliefs by observing others.
              Through the application of new laboratory experimental methods, this research
              will isolate the principles that lead to the successes.  Then, using the
              behavioral principles together with modern communications and computational
              technology, the research will produce new types of IAMs unlike any that are
              found occurring naturally.  Potential applications range widely across almost
              any complex system in which the need for information is continuous or
              reoccurring, the state is not clearly observed from any single vantage point
              and observation requires human interpretation.  Presumably, this would include
              anything ranging from epidemics, pending systems failures, the outcome of
              complex decision processes in an organization, or social tendencies.
