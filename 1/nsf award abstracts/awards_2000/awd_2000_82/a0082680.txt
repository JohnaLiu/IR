Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a study to determine the influence of lake-level
              changes on chironomid-based temperature estimates. A transect of cores from
              within each of two lakes in northern Maine will be examined for evidence of
              past water levels. Chironomid analysis will be performed on cores from both
              lakes. Geologic/chronologic evidence of Younger Dryas-age ice readvance in
              northern Maine will provide the data necessary to apply a well-developed
              glaciological model to determine the range of temperature and precipitation
              that could possibly have prevailed during this period. Chironomid estimates of
              temperature will be reconciled with the temperature range derived from the
              glaciological model, and the transfer function will also be refined with
              respect to lake-level. The new chironomid/lake-level transfer function will
              then be applied to Holocene sediments from the two lakes.
