ITR: Formal Methods Education
              and Programming Effectiveness: Are They
Related?

Software is often laced
              with coding errors which result in loss of life and
productivity.  These
              problems have been addressed by improved tools,
disciplined processes, more
              effective design and analysis, and software
product inspections.  This
              research addresses the problem through better
education.  This work seeks
              evidence for the integration of mathematical
reasoning in computing education
              as leading to improved programming skills.
 The project will measure and
              compare the programming effectiveness of two
cohorts: one that studies core
              concepts of mathematical reasoning within
the context of programming and
              another studying these core concepts in a
pure mathematical context.  The
              comparison measure of programming skills
will be software development projects
              in a subsequent course.  Learning
more about any relationships between
              programming ability and mathematical
reasoning can be an important step in
              improving curricula that educate
students for the critical information
              technology positions of the future
