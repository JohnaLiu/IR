Abstract    :
              This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. The goal of the
              "Virtual Trainer" is to create a computer-based animation that can
              interactively teach how to move.  The hardware requirements for the Virtual
              Trainer in its final stage would be an inexpensive state-of-the-art personal
              computer equipped with a camera system. The Virtual Trainer will be able to
              demonstrate movements to its user, monitor the execution of these movements by
              the user, and suggest corrections in case of inadequate performance.  The
              Virtual Trainer will be useful in a large number of applications, including
              rehabilitation of movement-impaired patients (e.g., stroke-patients), sport and
              exercise education, dance instruction, and interactive entertainment industry. 
              Additionally, the technology developed for the Virtual Trainer has the
              potential to pioneer new algorithms for robot control using "teaching from
              demonstration", to contribute to the development of automated monitoring
              systems for human environments, to the generation of humanoid computer
              simulations, and also to gaining new insights into biological motor control and
              the functioning of the nervous system. The research team of this project will
              primarily focus on issues of movement recognition and movement generation with
              the Virtual Trainer for rehabilitating stroke-impaired  patients with upper and
              lower limb disabilities.
