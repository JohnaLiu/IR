Abstract    :
              This award is for a study that will contribute to our understanding of the
              nature of persistent precipitation fluctuations by investigating the linkages
              between newly discovered long (1000+ years) tree-ring records from the Greater
              Yellowstone Region (GYR) and atmospheric circulation and sea surface
              temperature anomaly patterns in the Pacific Basin. Specifically, the project
              will address three questions: 1) what are long-term patterns of temporal and
              spatial variability of precipitation in the Greater Yellowstone region?; 2) how
              are multi-decadal patterns linked to indices of ocean-atmosphere interactions
              such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation?; and 3) what do long-term records of
              precipitation imply about the frequency and duration of droughts in the GYR?
              These questions will be addressed through the development of tree-ring based
              reconstructions of winter precipitation for the past 1000+ years based on a
              multi-species network of sites in the GYR.
