Abstract    :
              The   focus   of   this   project   is   on  the development  of
              conceptual
foundations    along  with   a   middleware    infrastructure   for
              rapid
construction  of   dynamic   and  secure  distributed collaborations. 
              This
project  is   investigating   techniques   for   constructing
              dynamic
collaboration  environments  from  their  high-level specifications.
              These
specifications are interfaced with  a  middleware  to  build  the
              desired
environment.  This  project  is  developing  techniques  for 
              specifying a
collaboration plan using XML  and  mechanisms  for  a  mobile 
              agent based
middleware  for  implementing  such  a  plan. A collaboration 
              specification
identifies the participants in a collaboration by  their  roles,
               and also
specifies  the  associated  role-based  security policies. It
              specifies the
shared objects together with the coordination  and   workflow
              requirements
for   information  flow   among  the  participants.  Mechanisms 
              are being
investigated for participants to dynamically join or leave an
              environment.
These    include   mechanisms   for   authentication   of  a
              participant's
credentials,  assignment  of  roles,  and  discovery  of 
              resources  by a
participant.   These  mechanisms  and  services are integrated
              in  an
agent based  middleware,  using  the  Ajanta  agent   programming
              system,
for constructing  distributed  collaborations. This middleware
              investigates
use of mobile agents for building  transportable  user 
              interfaces,
for executing remote  coordination  actions,  and  as mobile
              workflow
objects. It  also provides support for resource discovery, naming,
              event
management, and security.
