Abstract    :
              The goal of this work is to explore the fundamental properties of optimal paths
              
for robots subject to contact and velocity constraints, and to implement
              
practical path planners based on that exploration. This is a collaboration
              
to combine work on time-optimal paths with work on path planning
              
algorithms.  The primary application is to plan time-optimal paths for a
              
differential drive mobile robot that navigates a known environment.  
The
              planner will construct an explicit model of the configuration 
space and will
              search for time-optimal collision-free paths.  This 
defines the goals for the
              theoretical work: to identify constraints on 
the motions that reduce the
              complexity of the search.  Optimality 
and velocity constraints are both a
              source of such constraints.  A better 
understanding of time-optimal
              nonholonomic paths will lead to efficient 
planning of efficient motions.
