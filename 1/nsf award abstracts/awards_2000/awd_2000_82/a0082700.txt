Abstract    :
              Color vision in butterflies is dependent upon the presence of different
              photoreceptor neurons within the retina, which are sensitive to different
              colors of light. Just as in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, this
              results from the highly regulated expression of different forms of the light
              sensitive visual pigment rhodopsin, in different types of photoreceptor cells.
              During evolution, gene duplication events have produced numerous forms of
              rhodopsin in different species.  The PIs will study this evolutionary process
              and the origin of the different forms of rhodopsin. The PIs will examine the
              rhodopsins of the Tiger Swallowtail butterfly (Papilio glaucus) as well as
              those of more distantly related species. The PIs will measure the colors of
              light absorbed by the different butterfly rhodopsins and determine which
              specific photoreceptor cells within the retina express each form of rhodopsin.
              The PIs will also compare the amino acid and nucleotide sequences of these and
              other rhodopsins to determine whether the rhodopsins absorbing the same
              wavelengths of light are likely to have evolved from a common ancestral gene or
              if they may have evolved independently. These studies will clarify the
              evolutionary mechanisms by which color vision was established, and contribute
              to the basic knowledge of the visual system of insects.
