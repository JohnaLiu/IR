Abstract    :
              The PIs will undertake a three-year program of coupled experimental and
              theoretical studies of the formation of continental-margin stratal patterns.
              The program will use the new experimental basin with a subsiding floor where
              baseline, sediment supply and subsidence rates can be controlled. The
              experiments will focus on linkages among dynamic sedimentary environments and
              the relation between morphodynamics and stratigraphy. The studies will test
              some of the existing models of strata formation. Theoretical modeling of the
              continental margin's response to controlling factors and the comparison of
              numerical models with the experimental results will form a basis for refining
              both types of data.
