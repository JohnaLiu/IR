Abstract    :
              One of the most theoretically challenging and practically important
problems in
              modern computer science is the analysis of cryptographic
authentication
              protocols, which play an essential role in Internet
privacy and security. 
              There is a general cryptographic protocol
specification environment developed
              at SRI that includes a high-level
specification language, CAPSL, and an
              intermediate language, CIL,
based on a multiset rewriting rule model.  The
              objective of this
project is to write a translator to generate prototype
              protocol
implementations in Java from CAPSL specifications.  The
              translator
will use existing Java classes and APIs (application
              program
interfaces) for communication and encryption tasks. 
              Concrete
interface routines will be generated from the CIL representation.
              The
advantage of this approach is that the originally specified protocol
can
              be shown to be free of design flaws through analysis of the CIL
using other
              tools.
