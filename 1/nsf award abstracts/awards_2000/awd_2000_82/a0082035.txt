Abstract    :
              The primary thrusts of this research are to help improve human-computer
              interaction methodologies, develop new interface modes, make physics-based
              interaction accessible to all users, and enhance the capabilities of graphical
              modelers. To these ends, the PI is focusing on the interactive manipulation and
              direct sculpting of Subdivision Splines (S-splines) through the integration of
              physics-based interaction with powerful subdivision geometry, both in terms of
              its theoretical aspects and its practical aspects in visual computing
              applications. The novel, dynamic framework of s-splines will not only augment
              well-established NURBS-based design technologies but also generalize newly
              developed theory and methodology of physics-based modeling in the practice of
              modeling and design. The ultimate goal is to develop software environments that
              can greatly facilitate human-computer interaction through the physics-based
              modeling of graphical entities. This work will broaden the accessibility of
              graphical modeling by combining conventional geometric models with
              computational physics and applied mathematics, thus offering novel interactive
              methodologies based on realistic model behavior.
