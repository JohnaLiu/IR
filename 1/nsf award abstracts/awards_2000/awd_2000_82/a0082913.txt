ITR:  Quantum Information
              Processing with Ultracold Rydberg Atoms


Ultracold Rydberg atoms have long
              lifetimes and interact strongly at large distances, which may make them ideal
              for quantum information processing.  This project is investigating this
              possibility by studying and experimentally implementing a universal two-qubit
              logic gate, in which a two-atom state acquires a phase that depends on the time
              the atoms are interacting.  The project is investigating sparsely populated
              optical lattices containing Rydberg atoms, which will permit the preparation of
              well-identified atoms in arbitrary states.  The properties of atom-atom
              interactions, including the effect of external electric and magnetic fields
              will be investigated.  Finally, methods of reading the information stored in
              Rydberg atoms will be investigated, including imaged fluorescence and selective
              ionization.  Scaling to large numbers of qubits, as well as the effects of the
              optical lattice on decoherence, will be explored.
