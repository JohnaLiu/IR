Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is two-fold. The first is to test the adequacy of
              exemplar-based models of language processing. Two exemplar models will be
              utilized, Analogical Modeling of Language (AML) and Tilburg Memory-based
              Learner (TiMBL). To this end, these models will be tested on several linguistic
              phenomena in Spanish: stress placement, gender assignment, diminutive
              formation, and selection of change of state verb. A database containing
              800-2000 instances of each phenomenon will be extracted from available
              frequency dictionaries and Spanish language corpora. Each instance will be
              encoded as a set of linguistic variables that are pertinent to predicting the
              phenomenon at hand. The task will be to predict the behavior of each instance
              by using the remaining database items as possible analogs. For example, the
              gender of a given noun will be predicted on the basis of its similarities to
              other nouns in the database.

Since AML and TiMBL utilize radically different
              algorithms, the second aim is to determine which model makes better
              predictions. Each model will be compared on the above-mentioned language tasks
              in terms of its ability to correctly predict the linguistic behavior in
              question. For some of the phenomena, studies involving language acquisition,
              production of nonce words, and slips-of-the-tongue, are available. The ability
              of the exemplar-based models to mirror the data from these studies may provide
              additional tests on which they may be assessed.
