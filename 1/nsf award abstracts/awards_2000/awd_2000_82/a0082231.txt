Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for the conference on Stochastic Optimization:
              Algorithms and Applications which will be held at to the Center for Applied
              Optimization, University of Florida, Gainesville, Fla., February 20 to February
              22, 2000.  The conference will provide a forum for researchers working on
              different aspects of stochastic optimization to present recent discoveries and
              to interact with individuals working on industrial applications.

The
              benefits of the practical experience gained will allow application of the
              theoretical advances to financial modeling, asset-liability management, bond
              portfolio management, currency modeling, risk control, and probabilistic risk
              analysis.
