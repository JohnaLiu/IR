This project examines ways
              lenders make decisions about borrowers, focusing on "non-economic" factors such
              as a borrower's social status.  It includes both profit-making and non-profit
              lending organizations.  Many investigators have noted that various types of 
              "discrimination" probably figure into lending decisions, and this study
              attempts to specify the processes involved by examining the application and
              decision processes directly.  Some of the factors to be measured are how
              characteristics of borrowers signal loan officers of their reliability, and how
              those factors are used differently by loan officers in traditional and marginal
              loan markets.  The study emphasizes decision processes in the loan applications
              rather than outcomes.
