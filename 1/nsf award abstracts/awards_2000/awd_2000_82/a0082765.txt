Abstract    :
              This study will obtain a 6 Ma record of isotopic, faunal, and
              lithologic/chemical indicators from ODP Site 1146 in the South China Sea.  The
              multiple proxies will be used to develop a timeseries at 2 ka resolution of the
              East Asian winter and summer monsoon.  The record will be used to test the
              response in both intensity and timing of the seasonal monsoon to solar forcing
              and to changing Northern Hemisphere glaciation and other boundary conditions
              including uplift of the Isthmus of Panama.
