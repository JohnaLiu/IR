Abstract    :
              This award is for the development and quantitative analysis of a detailed
              physical cyclostratigraphy of the early to middle Eocene Green River Formation
              of the greater Green River Basin of Wyoming based on extensive cores and
              outcrops.  The study will use three suites of proxies for lake depth and hence
              climate: sedimentary facies (depth ranks), available shale oil yield data on
              cores, and geophysical logs.  External time constraints will be based on varve
              calibration and single crystal 40 Ar/39 Ar dating of tuffs within the
              formation.  Age models will be developed from these constraints as well as
              quantitative frequency analysis of the data.  Thus, the study will be able to
              produce an orbitally tuned cyclostratigraphy for much of the early and middle
              Eocene, with a resolution of less than 20,000 years, registered to the existing
              detailed lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and paleomagnetic polarity
              stratigraphy.
