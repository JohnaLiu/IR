This longitudinal
              project studies health statistics of Mexican immigrants to Chicago, in an
              attempt to understand a demographic and epidemiological paradox.  Despite
              generally better health care available in the U.S. than in Mexico, many health
              statistics are worse for long-term Mexican immigrants than they are for
              short-term immigrants.  Most earlier studies of this paradox have been
              cross-sectional rather than longitudinal.  This project uses a variety of new
              data sources: retrospective surveys, bimonthly clinic follow-ups, medical
              records, and state statistics related to health.  About 300 migrants will be
              interviewed about their health, health practices, and services they may have
              used over the past ten years.  Data from this study will be supplemented by
              other data from national samples, including the National Longitudinal Study of
              Youth.  Analyses will include hazard models for several health outcomes: infant
              health, birth weight, and mortality in first year.
