Abstract    :
              This project is a collaboration between members of the global optimization
              computer science and the computational biology communities to develop new
              methods for protein structure prediction and ligand docking. If successful, the
              methods developed here will help solve two important problems in computational
              biology - the need for fast conformational searching to predict the structures
              of proteins or complexes of proteins with other proteins and ligands, and the
              need to improve folding and docking models. Both problems are fundamental to
              understanding how the molecules of life work. This project will not solve these
              problems itself, but will develop new computational methods that can contribute
              to their solution.

Technically, there are two specific aims: (1) To develop
              efficient methods for searching conformational spaces to find globally optimal
              (native) conformations on energy landscapes. (2) To develop efficient methods
              for searching parameter spaces to find optimal parameters for the large,
              complex models that are common in computational biology. This work is based on
              Underestimator methods that do not search over the tops of energy landscapes
              like Monte Carlo, Simulated Annealing, and Molecular Dynamics, the current
              standard methods.
