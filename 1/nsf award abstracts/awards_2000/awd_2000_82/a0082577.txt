Abstract    :
              Interactive exploration effectively enables scientists to identify and interpret
              data, embedded in much larger datasets, that represents significant underlying
              phenomena. There is a critical need for data management support for the process
              of interactive exploration of very large data sets. However, scientific
              database research has not yet had a major impact on the way that scientists
              actually use scientific data. The lack of a comprehensive conceptual model for
              the scientific data has limited the success of current systems in becoming more
              general and less ad hoc. 

The principal goal of this research is to develop,
              validate, and prototype a formal data model for distributed multi-resolution
              scientific data that encapsulates its inherent structure to guide efficient
              database implementation. The model includes comprehensive geometry and
              topology-based features for describing a wide variety of sampling grids,
              features for representing sub-domains of a dataset that contain discovered
              knowledge, and error measures that reflect the accuracy or authenticity of each
              representation level. From a repository containing a dataset represented as a
              multi-resolution hierarchy, a scientist accesses successive levels of
              error-annotated detail to zoom into the meaningful areas, downloading data from
              these regions to a LAN and his/her workstation for further
