Abstract    :
              Parallel programs using MPI are widely used in compute-intensive scientific and
              engineering applications. They perform well on dedicated distributed memory
              machines and workstation clusters. However, their performance can deteriorate
              on multiprogrammed shared memory machines (SMMs) or clusters of those machines.
              This project will optimize execution of parallel programs through both program
              transformation and efficient run-time support. The resulting programs will
              deliver robust performance in both dedicated and multiprogrammed SMM
              clusters.

Technically, the work has three aspects:

It will study
              compile-time code transformations to achieve threaded execution of parallel
              code on a cluster of SMMs, allowing each MPI node to be executed safely as a
              thread.
It will study thread-safe run-time execution and fast lock-free
              communication that takes advantage of address space sharing among threads
              within an SMM.
It will evaluate and model a variety of scientific applications
              (including sparse-matrix algorithms with irregular computation, PDE
              computations with coarse-grain computation, and data-intensive applications) to
              verify the proposed techniques.
