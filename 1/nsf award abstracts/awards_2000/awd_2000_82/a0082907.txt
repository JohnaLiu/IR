ITR:  Revolutionary
              Computing Using Ultrafast Optical Soliton Switching

The objective of this
              project is to develop a new technology for ultra high speed (terabit per
              second) information processing, communication, and computing.  The technology
              is based on optical spatio-temporal solitons, which are localized packets of
              electromagnetic energy.  Logic devices and computing architectures based on the
              interactions of spatio-temporal solitons in two and three dimensions will be
              investigated theoretically and experimentally.  These devices and systems will
              employ materials with high order optical nonlinearities as well as artificially
              structured media designed to support soliton propagation and interactions. 
              This research is expected to provide a foundation for a robust, practical,
              compact, cascadable, and logically complete switching technology with
              processing speed and density orders of magnitude beyond those of existing
              information-processing electronics.
