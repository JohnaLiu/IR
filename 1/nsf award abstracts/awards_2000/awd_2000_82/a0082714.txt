              ABSTRACT

OCE-0082714


The Oman Upwelling Zone is one of the most
              physically complex and economically important regions of the Arabian Sea. 
              Although significant progress in understanding the physical, chemical, and
              biological dynamics of the broader region was achieved during the international
              Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), the limited resources available had to
              be expended on achieving an general understanding of the biogeochemistry of the
              greater Arabian Sea itself.   The purpose of this award is to support a joint
              seminar and workshop on the Omani Upwelling Zone involving investigators from
              the United States, Oman, and India.  The participants will synthesize an
              up-to-date picture of the state of knowledge about the Upwelling and then work
              to prioritize research imperatives for the future.  A workshop report will be
              published and disseminated.
