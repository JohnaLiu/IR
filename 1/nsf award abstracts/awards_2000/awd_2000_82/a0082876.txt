Abstract    :
              Future information appliances are expected to become increasingly mobile and
              operate under highly fluctuating workloads, thus imposing stringent design
              constraints on their energy dissipation, size, cost, performance, and quality
              of service.  This project explores algorithmic and design automatin
              technologies for creating computing systems that dynamically adapt their
              operation to their workloads with the objective to maximize thieir energy
              efficiency and resource utilization.  In the area of algorithms, research is
              conducted on the design and analysis of precomputation schemes that can be used
              to predict the load of a computation in the future and adapt system resources
              accordingly.  In the area of design automation, the project is concerned with
              behavioral-level transformations and scheduling algorithms that rely on
              precomputation to generate energy-efficient hardware or software
              implementations of general computations.
