Abstract    :
              Users increasingly want to use Internet applications for information access and
              processing from a variety of fixed and mobile networked computing devices, such
              as desktops, cell phones, and PDAs. These devices have different capabilities,
              are not equally secure, and operate under different network conditions.  Mobile
              users may also want to transfer an on-going communication activity from one
              device (e.g., a desktop) to a different device (e.g., a PDA). The proposed
              research aims to design a software framework for building
              distributed
applications to meet these emerging needs. A key concept is to use
              mobile, context-aware communicating components to compose distributed
              applications.  Using component mobility across devices, system designers can
              build robust and responsive applications that adapt to varying network
              connectivity and to various device capabilities. The framework will also allow
              applications to adapt to changes by dynamically adding and removing components,
              or by replacing a set of components with another set. To allow users to move
              active work across devices, communication among components will handle
              component mobility and tolerate transient disconnections.  This research will
              address performance issues, develop software methodology to accommodate device
              heterogeneity, and explore solutions to handling security concerns in using the
              framework to build distributed applications.
