Abstract    :
              The NSF grant  "Control and evolution of seawater adaptation in Oncorhynchus
              mykiss" will seek to determine genetic factors that differ between
              non-migratory forms of rainbow trout and sea-run forms known as steelhead.  
              These two forms are present in natural populations along the Pacific coast of
              North America but the genetic basis of the differences between them are poorly
              understood.  The differences will be studied by making crosses between
              genetically uniform lines of steelhead and non-migratory rainbow trout that
              have been developed at Washington State University, generating offspring from
              the hybrid between the two types, and examining the inheritance of both
              steelhead-like characteristics and DNA markers in the offspring.  The PIs will
              try to estimate how many genes and which specific genes are different between
              steelhead and rainbow trout.

This study will increase knowledge of how trout
              and salmon populations adapt to their specific environments.  Understanding the
              differences between steelhead and rainbow trout could be helpful in
              conservation programs by allowing more accurate identification of the groups,
              some of which are considered endangered or threatened.  In addition, efforts to
              farm rainbow trout and steelhead could benefit by making it easier to breed the
              trait of seawater adaptation into fast-growing rainbow trout strains.
