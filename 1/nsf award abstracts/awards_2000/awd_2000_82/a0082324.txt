              ABSTRACT

OCE-0082324


The principal investigator will conduct a survey of
              the concentration of oxygen and the amounts of three oxygen isotopes (18O, 17O,
              16O)  in the upper water column of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean to
              constrain the rates of net and gross production in the region..   The triple
              isotopic data will be used to estimate gross primary production., and the 18O
              measurements will can be used to constrain estimates of lateral diffusive
              mixing along surfaces of equal seawater density.  The project is expected
              provide a link between instantaneous the rates of production made in typical
              shipboard ocean "process" studies and basin-scale rates inferred from
              observations chlorophyll, nutrients, hydrography and other tracers assessed by
              satellite and hydrography.   The survey is expected to test and improve
              Generalized Circulation Models and biogeochemical models of the equatorial
              Pacific that are important not only for understanding primary production and
              oxygen cycling in this vast oceanic region but also for gaining an indirect
              assessment of the regional dynamics of carbon cycling.
