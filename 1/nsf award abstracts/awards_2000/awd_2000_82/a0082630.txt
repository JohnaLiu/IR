Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to reduce the cost and improve the
performance of
              observation-based branch characterization mechanisms in
the compiler and
              hardware.  Often, correlation discovered at great cost
or missed entirely
              through execution can be determined in a simple
algebraic fashion at compile
              time.  Relationships between program
structures can be inferred from these
              algebraic expressions and
subsequently conveyed to compiler optimizations and
              to the hardware
through appropriate mechanisms to be developed by this
              research.  Once
employed, these relationships can refocus the efforts expended
              by
observation-based mechanisms, or can eliminate the need for
              them
altogether.
