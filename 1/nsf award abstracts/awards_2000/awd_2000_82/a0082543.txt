Abstract    :
              Miller 0082543
Using ocean models, coupled ocean-atmosphere models, and
              observations the investigators will address scientific questions involving (1)
              the specific feedback processes in the Latif-Barnett decadal coupled mode and
              its consistency  with observations; (2) the fate of subducted temperature and
              spiciness anomalies traveling equatorward in the thermocline using a very
              weakly diffusive ocean model; (3) the adequacy of observations that sample
              anomalous subduction in the Northern and Southern hemispheres; (4) the baseline
              shapes and levels of spiciness spectra in coupled models; and (5) the specific
              tropical feedback processes in the decadal spiciness mode and its consistency
              with observations.
