Abstract    :
              This project explores two complementary techniques for addressing
fundamental
              limitations in replicating network services. The first aspect
of this proposal
              seeks to automatically replicate service programs and
state information to
              allow transparent caching or replication of dynamic
services. The goal of the
              research is to allow transparent caching or
replication of dynamic services, a
              key step toward automatically converting
unscalable service implementations
              into scalable ones. The second thrust of
this work is to allow network
              services to dynamically trade replica
consistency for increased system
              availability and performance. The TACT
(Tunable Availability and Consistency
              Tradeoffs) toolkit allows Internet
services to flexibly and dynamically choose
              their own
availability/consistency tradeoffs. We use three consistency
              metrics,
Numerical Error, Order Error and Staleness to capture
              application-specific
consistency requirements of Internet services. 
              Applications use these
metrics in addition to application-specific parameters
              to assign a numeric
value to system consistency, e.g., the percentage of user
              requests that
must eventually be rolled back because of underlying
              replica
inconsistency.  Finally, TACT allows consistency to be specified on
              a
per-user, client, and replica basis, enabling differentiated quality
              of
service.
