ITR: Research,
              Curriculum and Partnerships for Broadening the
Information Technology
              Pipeline

This project supports a collaboration to explore a new multimedia
              paradigm
for educating students for careers and lives in the networked
              information
age.  Through research and course delivery, this collaboration
              will explore
new curricula that allow students from a wide variety of
              disciplines to
obtain the understanding and skills that prepare them to be a
              part of the
modern information technology workforce.  The project will broaden
              the
information technology pipeline in two critical ways:  by increasing
              the
diversity of academic disciplines and aptitudes from which students
              can
enter the information technology workforce, and by applying this
              approach
to a racially diverse population.

The project will develop a
              multidisciplinary curriculum and research in
technology, arts, and media
              (TAM).  The research associated with the
development and evaluation of the TAM
              curriculum has four components: 1)
computer and cognitive science research
              addressing approaches to using
information technology in education that will
              help determine both the
content and the delivery of the curriculum. 2) social
              science research
about the impacts of the networked information age upon our
              society that is
linked to a key portion of the curriculum, 3) education
              research about the
use of information technology in K-12 education that will
              impact the
education course offerings of the TAM curriculum, and 4) formative
              and
summative evaluations of the TAM curriculum in achieving its goals.
