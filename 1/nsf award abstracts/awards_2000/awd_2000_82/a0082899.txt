Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is the production of an improved computer code for
              molecular electronic structure computation that permits the practical
              computation of the energy of a molecule with an accuracy at least ten times
              better than that currently possible. The project will apply this code to the
              computation of energy barriers and potential energy surfaces for elementary gas
              phase chemical reactions. Once it becomes aailable to the general scientific
              community, the code will find application to a wide range of other problems in
              chemistry and materials science. The computed potential energy surfaces will
              have immediate application for reactive scattering computations. In this way
              the project contributes significantly to the infrastructure that will
              eventually enable the computation of chemical rate constants from first
              principles. These constants are widely applicable. For example, they are
              essential input for computer models of atmospheric chemistry and
              combustion.

The new feature of this method is the use of
              Rayleigh-Schroedinger perturbation theory to treat the electron correlation
              cusp problem. Existing highly-developed orbital-based methods are well suited
              to description of the global behavior of the wave function. However, they are
              not well suited to the description of the cusp, a secondary feature that
              eventually limits the accuracy of large scale electronic structure
              computations. The new method solves the first-order wave function by use of
              explicitly correlated geminal basis functions.
