Abstract    :
              This proposal is for a conference grant for the eighth Small Genomes Conference
              (formerly the E. coli and Small Genomes Conference) to be held September 24-28,
              2000, at the conference center in Lake Arrowhead, California. There is great
              excitement over the prospect of comparing the sequences and contents of as many
              as 50 microbial genomes over the next year or two. Considerable integration of
              different aspects of microbiology will undoubtedly take place, including new
              perspectives on evolution and the requirements for life. To achieve these
              goals, particularly of integration and synergy, scientists from diverse
              disciplines must interact. Thus, this conference will include active genome
              researchers, such as sequencing experts and informatics specialists working in
              database design, sequence analysis, or simulation; geneticists developing new
              methods to take advantage of genomic information for functional analysis; and
              cell biologists and biochemists who have specialized in areas now ripe for
              genomics such as metabolism, chromosome structure, or gene regulation. One
              focus of this conference will also be on genomes of pathogens. While there have
              been a number of recent genome conferences, continuing completion and release
              of new genome sequences and developing momentum for analysis of this huge
              amount of information means the community has continued need of such
              conferences. This meeting has become established as a major annual microbial
              genomics conference during the last seven years and has assured status and
              quality.
