Title:  ITR:  Fast
              Superconducting Qubit and Qugate for Quantum Computing


An
              interdisciplinary team of experimentalists and theoreticians from the
              University of Kansas and the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
              are collaborating to explore the use of superconducting interference devices
              for quantum computing.  The SQUID devices under investigation consist of
              Josephson junctions embedded in a superconducting loop, and will be used to
              implement quantum bits and quantum gates.  This work concentrates on two
              problems:

1. To increase the decoherence time of qubits using niobium
              nitride (NbN) as the superconducting material.  NbN has much lower intrinsic
              damming than the commonly used niobium SQUID.  The Japanese collaborators, who
              have the best NbN junction fabrication facilities in the world, will make
              samples of tunnel junctions and SQUIDs.  These will be sent to Kansas for
              measurement of decoherence times.

2. To conduct an integrated theoretical
              and experimental study of Controlled-Not gates using SQUID.
