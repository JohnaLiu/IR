ITR: An Internet
              Robotics Learning Testbed

This research involves the implementation of a
              project-based learning strategy through the development and use of an Internet
              Robotics Learning Testbed (IRLT).  The IRLT will consist of a network of robots
              and control centers.  The robotic devices will be used for exploratory missions
              ranging from ocean archeology to space science and the control centers will
              provide wireless communication with the remote robotic devices in order to send
              commands and receive data.  Several IT learning challenges that emerge include
              human-computer interfaces, task planning, resource scheduling, fault detection
              and diagnosis, and goal-directed commanding.  The IRLT will enable students to
              understand the need for specific IT applications, iteratively develop such
              applications, test application functionality in an operational environment, and
              experience application value in a mission setting.  The IRLT will include a
              suite of services to support collaborating IT educators.  These services will
              include an educator support program to train faculty in the use of the IRLT as
              an educational resource, several pre-packaged educational modules permitting
              the rapid and low-cost use of the testbed, and Web-based documentation
              providing engineering details, user manuals, guides for new experiments, and
              libraries of past IT applications.  The IRLT will be centered in an
              undergraduate engineering curriculum and its high school outreach program.  It
              will draw stakeholders from multiple universities and research laboratories who
              will serve as advisors and mentors.
