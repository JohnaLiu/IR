Oftentimes in group
              settings, both status differences and in-group membership are salient. 
              Theories of status generalization describe how status differences can lead to
              inferences of differential ability, while theories of situated identities
              describe how group membership can lead to certain differences in influence
              behaviors.  In situations where both processes function, they may make
              different predictions.  For instance, a committee composed of Republicans and
              Democrats will show influence effects dependent both on ability inferences (a
              status process) and on group membership (an identity process).  This project
              offers a conceptualization of such situations, and tests the conceptualization
              in a series of experiments.  The primary result of this work will be to build a
              theory of how status and identity interact in some cases, and the theory may
              have important real-life applications.
