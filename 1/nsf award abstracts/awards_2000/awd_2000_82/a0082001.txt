This proposed research is for planning
              the development and expansion of
research, training, and education in
              electronic business (e-business) and
telecommunications of an information
              systems program.  Collaborative
research, enhanced course offerings,
              equipment, and industry partnerships
would result in new methods for educating
              citizens in information
technology (IT), expand the supply of entrants into IT
              professional jobs,
and increase the breadth and depth of existing computer
              science,
information systems, and marketing programs.  Research
              in
telecommunications would be expanded to involve experimentation with
              remote
teleconferencing systems to conduct IT work.  Other foci include
              anywhere,
anytime training over the Internet and experimentation with
              the
effectiveness of video distance training methodologies.  The overall
              goal
would be to expand education and training efforts to form a regional
              center
for the production of bachelor degree students with concentrations
              in
e-commerce and telecommunications along with technical
              Internet-oriented
coursework.  In addition, faculty and graduate students
              would have
opportunities to extend their training through telecommunications
              and
e-business oriented training workshops.
