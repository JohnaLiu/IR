Abstract    :
              Humans can recognize objects and scenes using their senses. The ability of
              learning the appearance of a great number of objects, organizing them into
              categories, and quickly recognizing them later is an important skill for
              survival. Replicating such ability in machines would be extremely useful in a
              great number of scientific and industrial applications such as automatic
              exploration of databases of medical images, diagnostics and quality control in
              industrial plants, automatic classification of images and sounds on the
              web.

The aim of this study is to develop a theory of recognition that is
              applicable any type of sensory data and where no supervision is required for
              learning and categorization.

The approach is probabilistic: object
              categories are modeled by probability density functions on part appearance and
              object shape. Detection and recognition are formulated as statistical inference
              problems. Unsupervised learning of object categories is approached using
              maximum likelihood. In order to motivate and test the theory the investigators
              will engage in three applications: automatic classification and retrieval of
              objects from image databases, of human actions from movies, and of neuronal
              signals associated with perceptual tasks.
