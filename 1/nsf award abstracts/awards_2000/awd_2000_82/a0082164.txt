Abstract    :
              The embedded processor of the future will have multiple heterogeneous processors
              on a single chip integrated with a large shared memory. Many of the
              applications for this processor will have strict real-time requirements.  This
              project investigates novel architectural and system software features that can
              allow such a processor to support complex real-time applications. 
              Architectural features that limit shared memory contention and reduce
              synchronization overhead will be studied in order to reduce latencies and make
              thread execution times more predictable.  The project will also explore the use
              of specialized I/O processors having direct and equal access to shared memory
              in order to minimize interference of I/O operations on real-time thread
              execution.   Novel techniques for scheduling real-time threads on a
              heterogeneous multiprocessor-on-a-chip will also be studied.
