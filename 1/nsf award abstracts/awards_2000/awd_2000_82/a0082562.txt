Abstract    :
              Summary:  This proposal is to provide partial support to acquire a new
              Delta-plus mass spectometer and a Kiel III sampling device to replace a 17
              year-old Finnigan-MAT 251 equiped with a 10 year-old common acid bath system
              that is that has recently been subjected to numerous breakdowns.
