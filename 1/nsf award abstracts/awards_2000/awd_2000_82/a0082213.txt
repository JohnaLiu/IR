Abstract    :
              This award is for a study that will examine otoliths, incrementally grown
              aragonitic skeletal elements found in the endocrania of fish. The species of
              sea catfish chosen is fully marine, non-migratory, and has a wide temperature
              tolerance. Otoliths collected from precisely dated archaeological sites from
              prehistoric coastal Peru will be incrementally sampled and analyzed for d 13C
              and d18O via micromilling and laser ablation mass spectrometry. These analyses
              will permit the principal investigators to calculate water temperature with a
              temporal resolution of approximately 2-4 weeks for continuous periods of up to
              30 years. Results will be compared to similar data from modern otoliths of the
              same species collected from waters near these sites as well as predictive
              models. Comparison of the data sets will allow for unambiguous assessment of
              seawater temperatures during the early and middle Holocene.
