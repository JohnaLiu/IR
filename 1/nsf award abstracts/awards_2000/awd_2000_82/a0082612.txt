Abstract    :
              EPIC (Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate processes in the coupled
              ocean-atmosphere system) is an activity of the US Climate Variability and
              Predictability (CLIVAR) Program. EPIC 2001 consists of four components
              focussing on (i) intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) warm pool phenomena;
              (ii) cross-equatorial inflow into the ITCZ; (iii) upper ocean structure and
              mixing; and (iv) an exploratory study of boundary layer cloud properties in the
              southeasterly tradewind regime. The field phase of EPIC 2001 is scheduled for a
              6-week period during the interval Sept 1 to Oct 15, 2001. In addition to the
              eight awards made by the Division of Atmospheric Sciences, this collaborative
              research has awards made by NSF's Division of Ocean Sciences and NOAA's Office
              of Global Programs.

Under this award, the PI will gather various data sets
              in the field phase, and use these to examine the set of mechanisms that force
              convection in the east Pacific ITCZ. The work will be key to the development
              and verification of parameterizations for diabatic processes in the atmospheric
              components of coupled ocean-atmosphere global circulation models. The work is
              important because it will improve understanding and modeling of climate
              variability over the eastern tropical Pacific.
