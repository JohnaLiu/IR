ITR: A
              Distributed Simulation Infrastructure for a K-12 Inquiry Environment

This
              research involves planning the construction of a scaleable,
persistent,
              interactive event simulation framework for supporting
knowledge-building
              curricula within K-12 education.  The proposed system
uses advanced simulation
              and information technology methods to create an
inquiry environment, fostering
              cooperative interactions and knowledge
co-creation while students work
              together to solve curriculum-based problems
and challenges.  The technical
              basis of such an inquiry environment is a
metacomputing system combining
              distributed discrete event simulations,
information and operational databases,
              graphical control interfaces, and
visualization.  While much of the system can
              be built from familiar pieces,
the focus on education provides a number of
              interesting opportunities for
new research in computing and metacomputing
              strategies.

The general area of user-directed simulations is viewed as a
              particular
area in which High Performance Computing (HPC) can become a true
              enabling
technology for substantive educational reform.  The proposed work
              will plan
the exploration, development, and extension of HPC technologies for
              K-12
education.  This work relies on strong partnerships in cognitive
              science
and education to ensure that the technology features and capabilities
              are
matched to objectives within progressive models of knowledge and
              learning.
The K-12 simulation framework that could result from this work may
              be
regarded as a first step in the larger task of matching HPC capabilities
              to
contemporary cognitive science and educational research,
              enabling
substantive advances in learning.
