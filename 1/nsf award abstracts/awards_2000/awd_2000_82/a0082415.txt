Abstract    :
                  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project is an effort to
              develop a new capability for the analysis of stable carbon isotope ratios and
              carbon dioxide concentration in air.  The method to be developed is
              laser-assisted isotope ratio anaysis (LARA).  The technique utilizes fixed
              wavelength isotopic lasers for specificity and the optogalvanic effect for
              sensitivity.  The research to be carried out in this study involves optimizing
              electronics, laser systems, and radio frequency discharge conditions to
              maximize signal to noise ratios and long-term stability.  The system will be
              tested under a variety of temperature, flow and humidity conditions using
              standard air in order to study the effect of these parameters on system
              precision and accuracy.  Experiments will be carried out with ambient air and
              intercomparisons with standard isotope ratio mass spectrometry will be done
              using flask air samples provide by existing air sampling networks.  The LARA
              technique has the potential to be a low-cost, field deployable research
              instrument for use on fixed and mobile platforms.
