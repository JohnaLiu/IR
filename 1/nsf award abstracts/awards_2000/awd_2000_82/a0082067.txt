Abstract    :
              This award is for support of Phase II of the Patagonian Lake Drilling Project
              (PATO), a multi-disciplinary, international collaborative effort to recover and
              analyze long lacustrine cores for paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate history.
              Based on the results of Phase I, the investigators plan to concentrate PATO
              Phase II on Lago Cardiel because it contains the most promising sequences in
              terms of continuity, chronology, temporal resolution, and paleoclimate
              sensitivity. PATO Phase II aims to: (1) Develop a 3-dimensional sediment and
              tectonic basin history based on analysis of the obtained seismic profiles and
              landscape imagery. Physical properties of the dated cores will be used to
              validate and calibrate the seismic stratigraphy. (2)  Further collect and
              analyze the modern lake and terrestrial components for climate calibration.
              Sediment traps will document sediment components, stable isotopes and
              biological proxies. These are needed to understand the hydrological,
              geochemical and lake productivity changes. (3)  Analyze sediment cores
              recovered during Phase I, estimated from our combined radiocarbon and ash
              chronology to date back beyond 18,000 years B.P., for magnetic,
              sedimentological, and geochemical stratigraphy (including stable isotopes on
              carbonates and organic matter), along with paleoecological stratigraphies for
              pollen, charcoal, diatoms, and ostracodes (including stable isotopes and amino
              acid racemization for chronological assessment).
