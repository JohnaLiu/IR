              ABSTRACT

OCE-0082238


Although efforts are being made in a number of
              laboratories to improve dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) analysis and method
              comparisons appear to show that different techniques are not too disparate,
              serious precision and accuracy problems continue to plague DON data.  For
              example, DON measurements from various experienced scientists showed that
              replication is on the order of 25-50%.  For this reason, the PI proposes to
              coordinate a large group of international analysts to evaluate the efficacy of
              the wet chemical technique versus the high temperature combustion (HTC) method
              and to develop guidelines for the HTC method for routine analysis using
              reference standards relying on help from a small group of laboratories
              dedicated to type of measurements.  However, the primary objective of the study
              will be the preparation and distribution of DON reference materials for broad
              use by the scientific community and to document and evaluate the impact of
              their use.
