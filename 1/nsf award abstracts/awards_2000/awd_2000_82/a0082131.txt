The research bears on the problems of internal and external  causes
              of climatic change. It emphasizes the role of the atmosphere in climate
              variability from months to years, of the oceans in variability from years to
              decades, and of the coupled ocean-atmosphere-ice-sheet system from decades to
              millennia. The methodology uses tools from fluid dynamics, dynamical systems
              theory, scientific computing and nonparametric statistics. The dynamical tools
              will be applied to a hierarchy of atmospheric, oceanic and coupled models.
              These models range from the simplest models with a small number of variables,
              such as box models of the ocean, to fully coupled general circulation models
              (GCMs).

The PIs will study coupling of  climate subsystems across timescales
              using various mathematical and statistical techniques. On the intraseasonal
              time scale of 10-100 days, the PIs will consider two complementary descriptions
              of low-frequency atmospheric variability, episodic and periodic, i.e. multiple
              weather regimes and intraseasonal oscillations. On the subannual-to-interannual
              time scale of 100 days to 10 or more years, the research emphasizes internal
              variability of the mid-latitude oceans' wind-driven circulation. This
              circulation is studied for prescribed time-constant and seasonally varying wind
              stress acting on ocean-only models, as well as for fully coupled
              ocean-atmosphere models.  On time scales of decades-to-centuries and longer,
              the PIs will use comprehensive coupled models such as CSM and IPSL. The
              simulations will be analyzed and compared with instrumental and paleo-records
              to determine and describe the relative importance of natural variability and
              anthropogenic climate change on these time scales. The work is important
              because it will increase understanding of climate variability across various
              time scales.
