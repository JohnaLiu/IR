Abstract    :
              This project, involving a collaboration with Auburn University (AU) and North
              Dakota State University (NDSU), focuses on research related to materials
              development with inherent passive and active damping, noise and vibration
              control flexibility in conjunction with affordable processing/manufacturing,
              and extensive dynamic characterization and modeling. The developed sandwich
              composite materials and structures can be used in a variety of infrastructures,
              commercial and defense applications, where composite affordability constitutes
              a prime area of concern. The expertise that effectively integrates the
              collaborating team includes the following strengths given by
              university:
University of Puerto Rico 
Passive damping and smart materials
              characterization 
Damage assessment and vibration modeling 
Mechanical
              response 
Analytical studies 
Nondestructive evaluation of advanced materials
              
Auburn University 
Acoustics and vibration testing, 
Active and passing
              damping 
Noise and vibrations control expertise and facilities 
North Dakota
              State University Fargo 
Affordable composite materials
              processing/manufacturing 
In-situ sensing 
Materials development 
Impact and
              dynamic damage response 
The outcome of the project is expected to have
              wide-ranging technical benefits with direct relevance to industry in areas of
              transportation (automotive, rail), infrastructure development (bridges,
              buildings and civil structures), aerospace, ship/marine, and other
              applications. The project addresses a significant number of doctoral, masters,
              bachelors, work study, undergraduate researchers, and high school students in
              the three jurisdictions, as well as under-represented groups.
