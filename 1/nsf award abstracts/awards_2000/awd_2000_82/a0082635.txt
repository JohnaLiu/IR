ITR: Security Education
              in Embedded Computing

Education and research will be tightly coupled as this
              effort focuses upon
security in networked embedded computer systems.  The
              vulnerability of
networked computers to malicious or mischievous attack has
              become apparent
with several recent incidents.  With the present trend to
              connect more
embedded systems to global networks, security is a growing
              concern.  The
investigators on this project seek to identify aspects of
              well-studied
embedded computing characteristics that can be extended and
              applied to
issues of security.  

The primary objectives of this work are to
              develop a theoretical foundation
for embedded system security and to expand
              the base of security education
for computer engineers.  The theoretical
              foundation will build upon the
body of knowledge developed over past decades
              in availability, reliability,
and safety research.  Educational modules will
              be made available and can be
used in the future to form the basis for a more
              extensive educational
program in this area.  The potential impact of this
              effort will include a
significant increase in the sensitivity to embedded
              system security issues
among those computer engineers who participate in the
              project or are
exposed to the educational modules.  Further, new applications
              of existing
techniques will improve the evaluation and design of embedded
              systems to
include security considerations.  Both of these impacts are
              significant to
increase the integrity of networked embedded computer
              systems.
