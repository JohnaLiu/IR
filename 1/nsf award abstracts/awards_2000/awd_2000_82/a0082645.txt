Abstract    :
              `The PIs will investigate and develop software and computational methods to
              address one of the most challenging current problems in molecular dynamics (MD)
              simulations - large proteins, consisting of tens of thousands of atoms in
              solution over the physiological range of at least a microsecond of folding
              time.  This will be accomplished using a reduced basis approach based on
              singular value decomposition (SVD) of the MD trajectory.

The work will
              entail:

- developing a block SVD updating scheme that will enable new
              trajectory information to be adjoined to a current truncated SVD approximation
              to a prior trajectory and avoid having to store the entire trajectory 
-
              developing, analyzing, and implementing a reduced basis integrator that will
              work in concert with the SVD updating scheme to compute the reduced basis
              simulation more rapidly
- adapting the fast marching algorithms developed for
              latent semantic indexing to develop the rapid graphical query tools to locate
              sites that potentially match local structures of interest
- developing the I/O
              support and visualization capabilities to handle the extremely large data
              manipulation and representation problems that will be generated

The result
              of the research will be an efficient time integration scheme that can
              drastically limit storage and yet resolve detail on multiple scales.  It will
              be demonstrated on a fully solvated protein molecule over a time scale of a
              microsecond, and the high order, low frequency motions will be visualized.
