Abstract    :
              This project explores techniques for efficient computation on large, disk-based
              data sets.   The research focuses on theoretical and practical aspects of
              ``active'' storage systems, in which each storage unit (a disk or group of
              disks) has some limited capability for local computation.  A key goal of the
              project is to develop a theoretical model for active storage systems.  The
              model is a basis for designing and evaluating algorithms for active storage
              systems, identifying useful computation kernels for active storage units, and
              deriving lower bounds for fundamental problems.  The applied aspects of the
              project include design and implementation of a programming environment (PEARL)
              for active storage algorithms, and experimental evaluation of new algorithms
              for active storage.   This project is a collaboration with a separately funded
              project team at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.
