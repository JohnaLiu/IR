Abstract    :
              EPIC (Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate processes in the coupled
              ocean-atmosphere system) is an activity of the US CLIVAR Program. EPIC 2001
              consists of four components focussing on (i) intertropical convergence
              zone/warm pool phenomena; (ii) cross-equatorial inflow into the intertropical
              convergence zone; (iii) upper ocean structure and mixing and (iv) an
              exploratory study of boundary layer cloud properties in the southeasterly
              tradewind regime. The field phase of EPIC 2001 is scheduled for a 6-week period
              during the interval Sept 1 to Oct 15, 2001. In addition to the eight awards
              made by ATM, this collaborative research has awards made by NSF/OCE and
              NOAA/OGP.

During the field phase, the PIs will collect data from GPS
              soundings and from scanning C-band radar permanently mounted aboard R/V Ron
              Brown. The boundary layer and cloud structure documented by these and other
              observations taken on the cruise will be compared with that from reanalyses and
              selected general circulation models. A goal of the integrative data analysis is
              to assess whether precipitation processes are significantly influencing cloud
              thickness and albedo over large spatial scales, and if so, under what
              environmental conditions. The work is important because it will improve
              understanding and modeling of climate variability over the eastern tropical
              Pacific.
