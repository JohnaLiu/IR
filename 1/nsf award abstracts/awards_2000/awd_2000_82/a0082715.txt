ABSTRACT

Collaborative Research on Ethnicity and Transition in
              Russia
OPP-0082781 and OPP-0082715

This project explores the connections
              between ethnicity, post-communist transition, and trust in Yakutia (Sakha) and
              Tatarstan, two leaders in the Russian republics' campaign for sovereignty.
              Principal Investigators examine the implications of ethnicity as social capital
              for intra- and inter-ethnic relations among Yakuts, Tatars, and Russians. The
              project uses survey data, decision-making experiments, and elite interviews.
              The project promises to shed light on the role of ethnicity in periods of
              economic transition.
