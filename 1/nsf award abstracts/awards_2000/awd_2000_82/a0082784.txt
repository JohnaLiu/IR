Abstract    :
              Rapid advances in computation and communication technologies are giving rise to
              an ever wider use of automation in the monitoring and control of dynamic
              engineering and computing systems in
manufacturing, communication networks,
              transportation, and electric power systems, to mention but a few key areas. 
              The software programs that monitor and control these systems are responsible
              for various functions, including start-up and shut-down procedures, monitoring
              and control, detection and isolation of significant events, system
              reconfiguration, etc.  We refer to all of these software programs as the
              "supervisory control software".  This proposal is focused on systems that are
              distributed over several sites and where the supervisory control software is
              distributed as well.  The goal is to conduct fundamental research on novel
              formal generic methodologies for designing distributed software systems that
              monitor and control systems with decentralized information.  We propose to
              bring the concepts and techniques of Systems, Control, and Decision Theory to
              bear on the problem of designing distributed software systems that are provably
              correct and efficient. As part of this effort, we will educate computer science
              and engineering students at the University of Michigan and Wayne State
              University on the fundamental issues associated with distributed software
              design.
