Abstract    :
              Application Service Providers (ASPs) - which distribute the use of software,
              rather than the software itself, via the Internet - are increasingly coming to
              be seen as one of the next major elements in the development of network
              services. This project will study and test the application of the ASP concept
              in an area where it is likely to have a particularly great influence: software
              for large-scale optimization. The complexity and variety of optimization
              software present challenging obstacles to the development of network services,
              but the exceptional variety and modularity of this software insure that
              successful efforts will have a broad impact in science, education, and
              business.

Technically, the project will build on previous work by the
              Optimization Technology Center of Northwestern University and Argonne National
              Laboratory. One subproject will investigate resource allocation for
              optimization requests whose needs cannot be easily forecast. Others will
              involve the design and testing of both client-side and server-side object class
              libraries that have no models in current mathematical computation. The project
              will also include the automation of algorithm choice and solver scheduling,
              through the construction and use of a database to learn from results of
              previous optimization requests and from human experts. The project thus brings
              together methods, software, and systems for computational large-scale
              optimization, with the aim of making the impressive technology in this area
              more accessible for applications, algorithm development, and education.
