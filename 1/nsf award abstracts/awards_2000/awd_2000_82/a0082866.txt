Abstract    :
              Highly interactive graphics applications have stringent latency requirements to
              ensure a compelling experience. These requirements are usually met by
              overprovisioning hardware resources and are validated through ad-hoc testing. 
              Recent advances in real-time scheduling technology could serve as the
basis
              for a more analytical approach. Unfortunately, conventional real-time
              scheduling disciplines are quite rigid and are usually implemented only within
              special-purpose real-time operating systems. For these reasons, real-time
              scheduling techniques have been largely ignored within the graphics
              community.

In this project, a real-time scheduling and analysis framework
              will be developed for latency-sensitive graphics applications.  This framework
              will extend recent work on rate-based processor scheduling. The proposed
              framework will allow timing requirements to be specified as average rates and
              will be highly tolerant of any deviance from specified rates. 

The proposed
              rate-based framework will be evaluated through research involving the
              nanoManipulator system (www.cs.unc.edu/Research/nano). The nanoManipulator
              couples a scanning tunneling microscope or atomic force microscope to a
              virtual-reality graphics display and a haptic interface to provide a
              telepresence system.  The existing nanoManipulator is not multi-threaded, and
              thus the system is difficult to modify and analyze.  In this project, a fully
              multi-threaded version of the nanoManipulator will be developed using
              the
proposed framework.
