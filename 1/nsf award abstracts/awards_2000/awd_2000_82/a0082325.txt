Abstract    :
              The project explores the possibility of whether application-specific
              customizations of embedded processor cores can preserve the fundamental
              benefits of a processor architecture, while alleviating the associated
              deficiencies, such as reduced performance and excessive power consumption. The
              fundamental approach undertaken is the identification of application properties
              during compile time and their dynamic exploitation during program execution by
              the embedded processor. The basic characteristic of these properties is that
              their existence can be statically identifiable by the compiler, and that they
              lead to significant improvements in performance when exploited dynamically.
              Extended transfer to the microarchitecture is to occur by embedding
              performance-boosting knowledge, rather than communicating it through narrow ISA
              channels. Microarchitectural features that can be enhanced with such
              application-specific information include the branch predictor, the cache
              subsystem and the dynamic scheduling hardware. While the proposed approach aims
              at processor customization based on application-specific knowledge, it does so
              without violating the flexibility offered by processor architectures. Late
              customization through microarchitectural reconfigurability exploits application
              and architecture characteristics, thus boosting performance, reducing power and
              area, while keeping intact the volume and flexibility benefits of general
              purpose architectures.
