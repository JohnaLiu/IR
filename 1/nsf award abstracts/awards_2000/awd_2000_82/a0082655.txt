ITR/SW: TeraScale
              Retrieval

TeraScale Retrieval addresses the scientific investigation
              of
large-scale information retrieval (IR).  TeraScale Retrieval
              will
facilitate experimentation to advance knowledge of
              information
retrieval, especially text retrieval, by implementing a
              software
toolkit for IR research and development.  IR systems seek to
              identify
documents or passages from documents that satisfy a human
              information
need.  Text retrieval is directed at collections of
              relatively
unstructured documents, such as HTML documents, as well as
              more
structured documents (e.g., XML).  In order to advance
              scientific
knowledge and improve performance of IR, there is a need for
              a
software toolkit that enables rapid and practical implementation
              of
experimental IR systems.  The TeraScale Retrieval toolkit will
emphasize
              large-scale performance with terascale datasets: hundreds of
millions of
              documents with terabytes of raw data, millions of unique
terms, multiple
              languages, and potential for quadrillions (petascale)
of sub-documents or
              document fragments.  The toolkit will emphasize
software reuse,
              high-performance algorithms, and modularity for rapid
prototyping and
              evaluation.  Rather than moving quickly from academic
use to
              commercialization, TeraScale Retrieval will focus on
experimentation and
              evaluation to contribute to scientific knowledge
about information seeking and
              use.
