              ABSTRACT

OCE-0082416
 
The marine biogeochemical cycle of phosphorus is
              intricately linked to the partitioning of major and trace elements within the
              ocean and to the atmospheric abundance of CO2, and on longer time scales, O2,
              through its role as an important nutrient.  Preliminary work by the PIs has
              shown that the oxygen isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic phosphate
              (d18Op) in continental sources of the weathering flux of phosphate is quite
              distinct from that of the deep ocean and varies with depth.  These variations
              in space and time of the d18Op in the oceans can be used as a means of
              estimating the rates of the biogeochemical and physical processes that control
              the availability and the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic phosphate.
               For this reason, the PIs propose to measure profiles of d18Op with depth at
              the HOT and BATS sites, as well as in transects of the Housatonic and
              Connecticut Rivers of Long Island Sound using new methodologies for sampling
              and analyses.
