This project uses
              data to be collected in Burkina Faso to assess a formal model of decision
              making as applied to decisions to put children out for foster care.  The
              general concern is to assess the importance of household demographic
              preferences, informal insurance mechanisms, and labor productivity on these
              decisions.  Both sending and receiving households will be tracked, thus
              improving on prior studies that only study one end of the transactions.  The
              outcome of this work will be a structural model for understanding household
              decisions regarding desirable size of families.  Results should be usable in
              designing programs to better meet the education, health, and labor needs of
              families.
