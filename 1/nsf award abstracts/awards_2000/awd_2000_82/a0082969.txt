High-temperature superconducting (HTS) films with transition
              temperatures above 77 K have numerous applications in quantum electronics,
              microwave and infrared devices. However, because of their complex chemical
              structure, the electron-electron, electron-phonon and electron-defect
              interactions in these materials have not been fully understood. Understanding
              the optical response and transport mechanisms in HTS films is crucial for many
              promising applications, such as infrared radiation detectors and modulators.
              This project uses infrared spectroscopy to examine the effects of film
              thickness, microstructure, and bias currents on the radiative properties. In
              addition, a synchrotron radiation source will be employed to measure the rapid
              changes of far-infrared reflectance of HTS films after picosecond optical
              excitations. Tunable Fabry-Perot resonators will be built from HTS films using
              a piezoelectric controller. The experimental results will be analyzed to study
              the quasiparticle dynamics and low-frequency residual losses. The thermal
              boundary resistance at the film-substrate interface will be determined from
              time-resolved measurements using a simplified kinetic-theory model.  Support
              from this NSF project allows cross-disciplinary education of two graduate
              students and provide research experience for several undergraduates.
