Abstract    :
              In 1998 academic researchers combined with the National Geographic Society (NGS)
              to design and implement "Survey2000: Charting Communities and Change," an
              effort that explores the potential and limits of web-based survey research.  A
              second survey effort to be hosted by the NGS website in the fall of the year
              2001 is the cornerstone of this project. The substantive focus of Survey2001
              centers on the impact of information technology on changing perceptions of
              global and local spheres in contemporary society. In particular, the survey
              examines respondents' perceptions and understanding of "global" and "local" in
              three areas: community, culture and conservation. The survey explores the
              extent to which new information technology has redefined the distinction
              between global and local.  A second aim is to consider methodological issues
              related to web survey research, in particular the non-random nature of a web
              survey sample.  Toward this end, the project calls for a parallel telephone
              survey effort using standard random digit dialing techniques to replicate the
              web survey.  Beyond questions of sampling and validity, Survey2001will pursue
              issues regarding web survey instrument development and implementation, as well
              as instrument and design effects in web surveys. Collaboration with the NGS
              assures that the results will receive broad public dissemination.
