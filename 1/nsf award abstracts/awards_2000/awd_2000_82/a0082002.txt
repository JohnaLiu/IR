This is a
              longitudinal, multi-level analysis of the diffusion of standards-based
              educational reform in the U.S. during the 1990s.  It examines the development
              of the national reform movement and variability of its application across
              states.  Data come from the National Assessment of Educational Progress,
              supplemented by qualitative descriptions of four illustrative cases (Arkansas,
              California, Connecticut, and Michigan).  Supplementary data sources include the
              NCES Common Core Data on schools' practices and teacher qualifications, and
              published reports of policy initiatives from national, state and local level
              educational systems.  Results will contribute to theoretical understandings of
              institutional change, as well as shedding light on some sources of contemporary
              educational practice in the United States.
