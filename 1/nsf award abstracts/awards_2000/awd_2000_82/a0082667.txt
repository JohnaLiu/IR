Abstract    :
              The DHARMA domain-specific middleware system being developed in this project is
              intended to allow hydrologic field engineers to address water-management
              problems, on a scale previously impossible, with sophisticated domain-specific
              computational management systems. DHARMA is used to provide automatic data
              acquisition via the Internet; data fusion from online, local, and cached
              resources; smart caching of intermediate results to allow for reuse in future
              simulation cycles; and smart scheduling to optimize execution times on
              metacomputing systems. Our target watershed model, WEPP, is a continuous
              simulation processed-based model which represents new soil erosion prediction
              capabilities. However, it is limited to very small watersheds with current
              computer technology. A revolutionary change in hydrologic modeling on the
              watershed scale will be brought about by applying the WEPP model to the 925
              square miles Lake Decatur watershed. Currently, all watershed scale hydrologic
              models are based on empirical relationships. WEPP is the only model which
              scientifically accounts for soils, sediment transport, runoff, channel flow,
              plant growth, decomposition, snow melt, freeze-thaw effects, and climatic
              conditions. Through DHARMA, WEPP is the only model which will provide accurate
              predictions and evaluate the effects of alternative watershed management
              practices on watershed water quality.
