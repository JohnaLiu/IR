Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop a methodology and set of prototype tools
              to enable "associative" mining of very large scientific data sets. The
              researchers will use content, such as solution features, patterns, and shapes,
              to examine the data and retrieve required information. Unlike other approaches
              that use index-based coordinates, this lets scientists answer the kinds of
              questions that they typically ask - such as "Have I seen this evolution
              before?" and "Is it similar to any experimental observations?"  The tools
              developed by this project will operate on distributed time-varying data and
              will act as templates for other methods. Specific technical objectives include
              developing distributed multi-resolution techniques for cataloging interesting
              phenomena and searching both run-time and archived data for interesting
              phenomena. The research will specifically target two domains that are
              representative of other scientific areas and have a pressing need for
              scientific mining tools: fluid dynamics (large-scale, high-accuracy Direct
              Numerical Simulation of compressible turbulence) and oceanography (comparison
              of simulation data with acoustic observations of hydrothermal plumes).
