Abstract    :
              A common theory of information fusion across multiple text sources is to be
              developed. Three main tasks are undertaken: (a) robust techniques for
              identifying structure across sets of related textual documents in arbitrary
              domains are developed and used to produce graph representations of the document
              sets, (b) an environment in which users can specify their summarization
              preferences is created, and (c) graph-based methods are applied to produce
              personalized multi-document summaries of clusters of the related documents
              based on the users' priorities.
 
Cross-document structure is based on
              features such as paraphrasing, contradiction, change of perspective, and
              complementation. A large-scale taxonomy of cross-document links is being
              investigated.
 
Providing users with personalized abstracts of large amounts
              of critical textual information is expected to speed up and otherwise
              facilitate their access to the Web. Large-scale deployment of a Web-based
              summarization system based on cross-document structure is planned and is
              expected to be used by millions of users.
