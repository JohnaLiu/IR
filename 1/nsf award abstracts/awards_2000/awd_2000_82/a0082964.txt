Abstract    :
              The goal of the Sutter graph database architecture is to help biologists make
              sense of the human genome, by enabling them to search genome sequence
              alignments for patterns of functional and structural relationships between
              genes.  Sequence alignments are the key for discovering meaningful connections
              between diverse biological data, to make sense of the completed Human Genome. 
              Yet no current database is designed to query detailed sequence alignment
              relationships as is needed.  The Sutter architecture is designed to provide a
              fast, flexible, and intuitive query system for genomic alignment data, based on
              storing the entire graph database in a set of indexes, enabling direct lookup
              for any item to find its relationships.  By focusing on indexing, Sutter can
              move away from the fixed, inflexible schema (table structure) of relational
              systems, while retaining some of the basis of their speed.  A major design goal
              of Sutter is to implement genomic data objects efficiently, enabling it to
              store a full genome database in RAM, and achieve dramatically faster query
              performance. Sutter's first application is to serve the genome research
              community as an online resource for mining single-nucleotide polymorphisms,
              their effects on protein function, and mapping disease genes.
