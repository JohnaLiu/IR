ITR: Women-Friendly
              Environments for Learning Information Technology

There is currently an
              unsatisfied national demand for people trained in
information technology (IT)
              with a minority of the students enrolled in IT
programs being female.  The
              proposed project is to develop an educational
approach that will appeal to
              women and provide them with an appropriate
learning environment for IT
              courses.  There are four components to the
project.  First, will be efforts to
              build upon results of investigations on
how to use technology to increase
              learning and decrease costs as taught
within an IT fluency course.  Second,
              will be research on learning styles
to provide quantitative evidence to
              explore the validity of learning styles
in general, and the consistency of
              women's learning styles, particularly,
correlations between learning styles,
              learning environments and
performance.  Third, will be research on how to
              improve Web-based
collaborative experiences.  Fourth, will be the testing of
              findings through
comparisons of learning achieved in a traditional environment
              with learning
in an environment restructured to take into account the
              project's findings
and those of other researchers in the field.  The specific
              application of
the project will be the development an a women-friendly
              information design
and technology undergraduate certificate program that is
              accessible to
students of any major.  The introductory courses of the
              certificate program
will be designed so that students can move easily into
              either a traditional
computer science or media studies program.
