Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to develop innovative technology for analyzing
              complex structured databases, particularly in biological domains, that can be
              used to find interesting and useful patterns and regularities in these rich
              domains. The work is motivated by two challenge problems from molecular
              biology: gene expression data and tuberculosis data. The former data are the
              key to understanding the function of certain genes in an organism and therefore
              how those genes manifest themselves as properties of the organism. The latter
              data are useful in understanding the infection patterns and eventually
              controlling the spread of TB. Similar data can provide deep scientific
              understanding of many other biological processes. This project will develop
              languages for statistical modeling of biological processes, techniques for
              learning the models from data, and algorithms for reasoning with the resulting
              models. The project will be based on probabilistic relational models, an
              extension of Bayesian networks recently developed by the Principal
              Investigator.
