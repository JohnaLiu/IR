Abstract    :
              Several large-scale IT applications are enabled by the design, implementation
              and evaluation of a scalable real-time streaming media architecture.  Large
              volumes of real-time data are stored, maintained, and retrieved online. 
              Popular examples of real-time media include video and audio, while less
              familiar examples are haptic and avatar data.  The real-time end-to-end
              delivery of very high quality (megabits per second) media cannot be supported
              with the current Internet-based infrastructure due to the lack of a scalable
              server architecture as well as a missing global resource management
              protocol.

The evaluation of our architecture in a realistic setup is the
              objective of integrating three of our previous successful research projects: 1)
              a distributed real-time file server (RTFS), 2) a redundant hierarchical
              interconnect architecture (RedHi), and 3) the Super-streaming paradigm to
              improve individual RTFS utilization by using client side resources.

The
              impact of this architecture is on both the server design as well as the online
              multimedia content.  Furthermore, the realization of such an infrastructure is
              enabling large scale applications such as video-on-demand, news-on-demand,
              distance learning and scientific exploration and visualization.  These
              applications, in turn, will be promoting teaching, training, and learning as
              well as enhancing scientific and technological understanding.
