ITR: Fluency 1 and
              Teaching Teachers to Teach IT

Fluency with information technology (FIT) is
              the ability to effectively use
computers, networks, software and information
              resources now and in the
future.  Fluency is a new standard of IT knowledge
              formulated by the
National Research Council's Committee on Information
              Technology Literacy in
their report, Being Fluent With Information Technology.
               To enable students
to continually learn IT, Fluency provides the foundations
              (concepts) on
which to build further understanding, and the mechanisms
              (capabilities) to
understand when more must be learned.  The goal of this
              project is to pave
the way for the widespread offering of information
              technology fluency
courses in K-12 schools, community colleges and adult
              education.  The
project will allow the creation of a Fluency 1 curriculum
              whose
presentation stretches over one year, allowing for a paced introduction
              of
IT topics and time to prepare for and work on IT projects.  Fluency
              1
contains components of algorithmic thinking and programming and should
              help
provide teaching guidance that is suitable to assist a present
              "computer
literacy" teacher in teaching Fluency.
