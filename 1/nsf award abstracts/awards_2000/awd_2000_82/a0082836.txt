Abstract    :
              This project involves the study of the behavior of polynuclear aromatic
              hydrocarbons (PAHs) occurring at the gas/liquid interface of fog droplets. 
              Laboratory measurements will be made to evaluate how the thermodynamic
              properties of PAH affect their partitioning between atmospheric fog droplets
              and air, information needed to model the fate and transport of PAH in the
              atmosphere.  The dependence of PAH  partitioning on temperature, multi-species
              concentrations, and fog droplet diameter will be assessed.  Measurements will
              also be made in the field to derive fog-water/air partition coefficients in
              ambient air and to verify the laboratory results.
