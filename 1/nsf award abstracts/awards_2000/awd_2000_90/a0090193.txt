This award supports Professor Clark C. Liu, Department of Civil
              Engineering, University of Hawaii, to conduct collaborative research with Dr.
              Jae-Woo Park of Ewha Womans University in Korea.  The joint study will
              investigate problems associated with desalination of water using wind-powered
              reverse osmosis.  Principal objectives of the project include development of a
              feedback control sub-system and investigation of fouling mechanisms associated
              with wind-powered reverse osmosis desalination.  

Fresh water is a major
              factor in limiting the sustainable development of many remote regions.  The
              problem is compounded for many islands and other remote locations where a short
              supply of electricity does not allow the use of electricity for desalination. 
              Thus, development of desalination technology that utilizes wind energy for the
              reverse osmosis process holds great potential.   This project will combine the
              complementary expertise and facilities of the American and Korean laboratories
              to advance our mutual understanding of the problem.
