Kitching
This award supports John Kitching and students from the
              University of Colorado in a collaboration with Robert Wynands of the Applied
              Physics Department at the University of Bonn, Germany. The research funded by
              this award will study ways to increase the signal strength of dark-line
              resonances in three-level atomic systems, which are significant for both
              magnetometry and atomic clock research.  Problems associated with the
              measurement of the small absorption limits the stability of clock reference
              frequencies and magnetometer sensitivities.  The results of this research will
              be of benefit to the magnetometry work at Bonn and to the atomic clock research
              at the University of Colorado and at NIST, since both fields rely on the
              physics of exciting and measuring hyperfine transitional in alkali atoms.  Not
              only will this collaboration lead to a better understanding of the underlying
              physics, but will also lead to a practical exchange of technological methods
              now used in each field individually. The opportunity this joint, collaborative
              research effort presents junior researchers is substantial, and the work done
              on this proposal will help institutionalize the relationship between the German
              and U.S. research groups.
