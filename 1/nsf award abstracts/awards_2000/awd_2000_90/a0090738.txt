Abstract    :
              The major goal of this project is to develop a new base calling technique that
              will improve the efficiency of the DNA sequencing process.  This will be
              achieved by increasing the average length of error-free sequencing and
              enhancing the base identification process at the beginning and end of
              sequences.  This will increase sequencing throughput and reduce the cost of DNA
              sequencing.  Previous work by the PI has demonstrated the ability to extend the
              error-free read by 30%.  This was achieved through work on cross-talk
              filtering,  baseline adjustment, base-spacing prediction and development of a
              fuzzy base-calling algorithm.  Further adaptive capabilities as well as full
              development and implementation of the methodology is planned.  The software
              will be tested on a large number of DNA sequences and remove specific hardware
              and operating system requirements, as well as be exploitable over the web. 
              Accurate, inexpensive genomic DNA sequencing will be a cornerstone of 21st
              century biology.
