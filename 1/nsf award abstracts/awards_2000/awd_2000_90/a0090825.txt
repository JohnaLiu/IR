Abstract    :
              The goals of this research are to assess the effectiveness of an activated
              anti-herbivore chemical defense system in algae, and to identify geographic
              trends in these defenses.  In this defense system, dimethylsulfonioproprionate
              (DMSP) produced by the algae is converted with the enzyme DMSP lyase, to
              dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and acrylic acid when the plant is damaged by
              herbivores.  Both DMS and acrylic acid can be potent feeding deterrents. 
              Because grazing pressures are generally thought to be higher at lower latitudes
              than at higher latitudes, the PI will measure the production of DMSP and DMSP
              lyase from algae in four regions: the temperate northeastern Pacific region,
              the temperate Southern Pacific region, the tropical Pacific region, and the
              tropical Atlantic region.  In each region, the investigators will assess the
              effectiveness of the DMSP activated defense system on local herbivores and the
              effects of changes in environmental factors such as temperature, nutrients, and
              ultraviolet light, on the production of DMSP and DMSP lyase.  The results of
              this study will provide information on how chemical defenses and
              plant-herbivore interactions have evolved in different parts of the world, how
              they vary over space and time, and how they are affected by changes in the
              environment.  This research will provide training opportunities for several
              undergraduate and master's level students during each year of the project. 
              Over a dozen students will be involved in all aspects of the work and will
              receive valuable training in state-of-the-art analytical methods, experimental
              design concepts, statistical analyses, and the use of computer programs for
              analyzing data and presenting the results of their work to other scientists.
