Abstract    :
              James has been exploring the arithmetic properties of the Fourier coefficients
              of modular forms of integral and half-integral weight from a theoretical and a
              computational point of view.  His research has been especially focused on
              problems related to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, Goldfeld's
              conjecture and to the Lang Trotter conjecture.  He has been successful in
              proving results toward Goldfeld's conjecture and toward a weak form of the
              Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.  In addition, along with K. Ono he has
              been successful in proving a result concerning the behavior of the Selmer
              groups of quadratic twists of an elliptic curve.  Recently, K. Murty and James
              have been conducting extensive investigations into certain generalizations of
              the Lang and Trotter conjecture from both a numerical and statistical point of
              view.

James is planning to continue to explore the connections between
              modular forms and arithmetic geometry.  In particular, he hopes to better
              understand the structure of Tate-Shafarevich groups of elliptic curves and the
              distribution of the coefficients of modular forms of integral and half-integral
              weight.  James plans to proceed with both numerical and theoretical
              investigations into these matters
