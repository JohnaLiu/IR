Abstract    :
              The digestive cells of the sea slug, Elysia chlorotica, have an endosymbiotic
              association with chloroplasts from the alga, Vaucheria litorea.  These
              chloroplasts, obtained from ingested Vaucheria, remain viable and functioning
              within the sea slug for months. The PIs have previously demonstrated that the
              captive, functional plastids synthesize proteins, including those that seem to
              be coded for in the slug genome. They have recently identified some of those
              proteins as belonging to the light harvesting complex I (LHCI) and have
              developed preliminary molecular evidence for the presence of the LCHI gene in
              the slug genomic DNA. For this proof-of-concept award, the PIs will conduct
              experiments designed to identify plastid protein genes in the host cell genome.
              Such transfers of genes from the symbiont into the host cell nucleus must
              certainly have been associated with the mechanism of the widely accepted
              endosymbiotic origin of intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria and
              chloroplasts. If a successful interspecies gene transfer between an alga and a
              slug mediated by an endogenous virus can be demonstrated in the case of E.
              chlorotica, then an exemplary mechanism for this process will have been
              provided.
