Sensors on Flexible Substrates for Smart Skin


This is
              a one-year Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER). This project concerns
              the development of suspended, micromachined sensors on flexible substrates. The
              project's results will form a basis for the production of other micromachined
              sensors such as pressure/strain sensors, "hair-like" touch and flow sensors,
              and accelerometers on flexible substrates. Flexible substrates can serve as the
              basis of a sensitive skin for humans and robots where sensors are distributed
              over the skin to provide the sense of touch or monitor the physiology of the
              wearer. A major obstacle in the development of vanadium oxide bolometers or
              lead titanate and similar oxide pyroelectric detectors on flexible substrates
              is the incompatibility between the thermal budget required by the detector
              material and the low maximum temperature of the flexible substrate. This work
              will solve the incompatibility between the two thermal budgets by the use of
              the PI's patented microbolometer material: semiconducting Yttrium Barium Copper
              Oxide (YBaCuO). The deposition temperature for this infrared sensitive material
              does not exceed 150 C. High quality nanocrystalline, semiconducting YBaCuO
              films can be deposited using rf sputtering at ambient temperature. Since there
              is no requirement for crystallization, high-temperature annealing steps are not
              necessary. 

The funding for the project is provided by two NSF divisions, as
              follows:
    IIS/CISE   - $50,000
    ECS/ENG - $20,000
