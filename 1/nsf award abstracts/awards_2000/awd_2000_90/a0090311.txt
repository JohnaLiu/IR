Abstract    :
              The Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) - a global network of rainforest
              research plots - compares data from tropical rainforests from around the globe
              to better understand the questions of why this ecosystem is the most diverse in
              the world and how this extraordinary diversity can be maintained.  CTFS
              monitors over three million trees, managing a database of more than 10% of all
              tropical tree species.  CTFS maximizes the potential for analyzing and
              synthesizing this enormous database of rainforest trees by increasing training
              and analytical capacity within the network. This Research Coordination Network,
              based on CTFS, will organize a series of month-long analytical and training
              workshops over five years, with the objective of: (1) building the technical
              expertise of US and developing world scientists in data analysis and modeling,
              and (2) developing generalizations about forest dynamics and the maintenance of
              species diversity in the tropics.  

The value of rainforests far exceeds
              even their great wealth of species; they are the largest terrestrial source of
              carbon storage in the world, provide storehouses of genes for drug and
              agricultural development, and provide local communities with environmental
              services such as watershed protection and local climate control.  Yet
              rainforests are also one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world.  The
              global standardized dataset from the CTFS network provides a unique resource
              for scientists to improve our global understanding of how these forests can be
              best managed and conserved.
