This dissertation research by an anthropology
              student from the University of Chicago studies how Palestinian and Jewish
              Israelis living in mixed towns understand and express their identity.  Arab
              Israelis live in a democratic state that excludes the possibility of their full
              citizenship, yet at the same time they are territorially, demographically and
              politically peripheral in the Arab world at large. Palestinian Israelis are
              caught between the Israeli state and the Palestinian nation, neither of which
              is capable of providing full commitment and membership.  As a collective this
              group lives a paradoxical existence: the more it remains intact in its
              traditional place and asserts a right to sovereign determination, the more it
              finds itself disconnected and excluded from nationhood and citizenship.  The
              project will study this paradox in the nationally and ethnically mixed urban
              contexts of Jaffa, Haifa, Acre and Ramla.  Ethnographic research in Jaffa will
              study the effects of accelerated gentrification involving affluent Jews and
              poor mixed neighborhoods as well as the process of change involving Arab
              inhabitants moving into formally Jewish neighborhoods.  Using participant
              observation in Jaffa the student will study Muslim and Christian Palestinians
              as well as three sub-groups of Jewish inhabitants: old lower-class immigrants,
              new wealthy gentrifiers, and young students. Using archival research the
              student will document the comparative history of Jaffa and Haifa, Acre and
              Ramla as mixed towns. 
This research is important as it will advance our
              understanding of the sources and nature of the intergroup tensions in this
              important area of the world, as well as providing training for a young social
              scientist.
