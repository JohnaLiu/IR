The specific aims of this proposal are to:  (1) Develop drug
              carriers which bear ligands to adhesion molecules expressed on irradiated
              endothelial cells.  The carriers will be made of polystyrene (model carriers),
              as well as pharmacologically relevant biodegradable polymers. (2) Quantify the
              extent of selective and specific adhesion/deposition of drug carriers on
              irradiated endothelial cells under in vitro flow conditions that stimulate flow
              conditions present in vivo.  (3) Demonstrate the feasibility of this targeted
              delivery technology in vivo in a mouse closed cranial window model.
