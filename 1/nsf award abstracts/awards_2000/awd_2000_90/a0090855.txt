Abstract    :
              This project provides 20 scholarships the first year and 40 scholarships the
              second year for students majoring in computing engineering. Thus the first
              cohort of scholars receive continued support if they maintain their eligibility
              in the program. During the third year, scholars can participate in industrial
              internships or on-campus research projects. Recruitment into the program
              focuses on graduates of community technical colleges, undecided engineering
              students, and those interested in transferring from other disciplines into
              computer engineering. Computer engineering faculty serve as advisors for the
              scholars, while academic support services such as peer mentoring and tutoring
              are available through the Institute of Teaching and Learning at the University
              of Connecticut.
