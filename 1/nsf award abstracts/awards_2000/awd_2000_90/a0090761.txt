Abstract    :
              There is increasing interest in the teaching of technological literacy in
              schools. Technological literacy is the basis for the development of programs in
              Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Research into how students come to
              understand technological concepts lags behind similar research in science and
              mathematics education. This conference is the second conference of researchers
              in science and technology education to consider how students learn about
              technology. The first conference surveyed existing issues. This conference is
              to discuss specific models that would be useful in technology education and
              provide some guidance in planning research projects. The research will
              influence materials development and professional development projects in ATE
              and Instructional Materials Development (IMD.)
