The Water Science and Technology Board of the National
              Academies provides a focal point for studies related to water resources and 
              the role of  environmental engineering in this context. The Board's objective
              is to provide information to improve the scientific and technological basis for
              resolving important questions and issues relating to management of water
              resources. A major function of the WSTB is to conduct studies and sponsor
              workshops and conferences that can be utilized for program planning purposes. 
              In this way, the WSTB provides a means for coordination of research plans with
              other Federal agencies, including the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, the
              U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S.
              Department of Energy, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. ***
