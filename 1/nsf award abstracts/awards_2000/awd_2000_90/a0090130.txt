Abstract    :
              The International Technology Education Association (ITEA) has developed and
              distributed the Standards for Technological Literacy. The National Academy of
              Engineering has supported this effort and has convened a committee to make the
              case for teaching technological literacy in schools, and the Institute of
              Electrical and Electronic Engineers has convened conferences on this issue. Two
              year colleges are developing programs to alleviate the major shortages of
              technologically competent people to work as technicians. Yet the average
              citizen has little appreciation for the importance of a basic understanding of
              technology, its development and history and its effect on society and society's
              effect on technology. This project is collecting information and ideas on the
              concepts technologically literate citizens should know from a leaders in the
              technology community. The information will be used to publish a book on
              technological literacy aimed at a general audience.
