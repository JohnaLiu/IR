This research is designed to characterize the
              conformational determinants and the potential significance of a new form of the
              DNA double-helix induced by cytosine methylation (d m5C) or bromination (d
              Br5C). This novel conformation was discovered in the single-crystal structure
              of d(GGCGm5CC)2 and d(GGCGBr5CC)2 . The obvious questions that arise with any
              new conformation of DNA discovered by X-ray crystallography include: 1) what
              are the sequence requirements for its formation, 2) does this form exist in
              solution, and 3) is the structure relevant? The long-term goal is to use this
              structural information to locate E-DNA in
genomic sequences and, consequently,
              place the conformation in a broader biological context.

The first objective
              of this project is to define the types of sequences beyond the parent sequence
              d(GGCGm5CC)2 that can adopt this novel conformation. The second objective is to
              determine whether E-DNA exists in solution by defining a spectroscopic
              signature that links the conformation in the crystal with its formation in
              aqueous solution. The third objective is to test the hypothesis that E-DNA is a
              discrete intermediate in the pathway that leads to A-DNA. The studies will
              start with the complete set of crystal structures from B-DNA to A-DNA for the
              sequence motif d(GGCGCC)2 , and use these structures as a basis for molecular
              simulations to map the thermodynamics for the B-DNA to A-DNA transition. The
              results will be confirmed by stopped-flow transient kinetic studies. The final
              objective is to test the hypothesis that the conformation and solvent structure
              of E-DNA facilitates the deamination reaction that ultimately leads to the
              rapid mutation of dm5C to dT nucleotides. The incorporation of 18O from
              isotopically enriched water into the crystals of A-DNA, B-DNA, and E-DNAwill be
              monitored.
