Richard G. Olmstead 

Dr. Richard Olmstead at the University of
              Washington has been given an award to study the systematic relationships among
              the major groups of living seed plants and land plants.  The proposed research
              addresses the question of the early diversification of plants following their
              adaptation to life on land by comparing carefully chosen gene sequences
              selected for their slow evolutionary rate, which makes them well-suited to
              study ancient plant diversification.  Determining the pattern of early
              diversification of land plants and seed plants has implications for our
              understanding of what the earliest land plants may have looked like and for
              what the course of evolution in reproductive and vegetative features may have
              taken.  Several prior DNA-based studies examining individual genes have yielded
              conflicting results or have been unable to resolve relationships among the
              extant representatives of lineages that diverged over 200 million years ago. 
              The experimental approach will be to determine DNA sequences for 17 chloroplast
              genes totaling approximately 13,000 nucleotides for each of approximately 50
              plant species chosen to represent previously identified "critical" lineages of
              land plants.  This work builds upon Dr. Olmstead's prior work on the early
              diversification of flowering plants.  This will provide a 3-fold increase in
              the data pertaining to the problem and should provide a substantially improved
              picture of the early radiation of living land plants.
