This award is to South Dakota State University to
              support the activity described below for 36 months.  The proposal was submitted
              in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF
              0082).

Partners
The partners are South Dakota State University; Daktronics,
              Inc; Falcon Plastics, Inc; MTR, Inc.

Proposed Activities
The activities of
              this award include support for education; product development; research in
              rapid prototyping; technology transfer; developing a rapid prototyping facility
              at the university; product design; assistance in rapid prototyping to small
              industries in the region.

Proposed Innovation
The innovation goals include
              transfer of the latest research in rapid prototyping to medium and small
              manufacturing firms in the state.  The proposed activities will bring an
              important capability to a region that needs to develop more technology-based
              manufacturing.  This activity will make the region more attractive to
              businesses and manufacturing firms and make the existing firms more competitive
              nationally.  The educational component will provide a technologically literate
              workforce at the engineering level.

Potential Economic Impact
The rapid
              prototyping facility will provide a laboratory for education of engineers in
              South Dakota, provide the economic benefits for small companies in the region
              who cannot afford to own the facilities, provide technical support for emerging
              small manufacturing firms in the region.  The facility should be
              self-sustaining by year four by membership fees.

Potential Societal
              Impact
The activity will provide more high tech manufacturing jobs for the
              state, and raise income in a region that has lagged the nation.
