The goal of this project is to identify the causes of differences in
              feeding behavior among bacteria-eating soil nematodes. The organ responsible
              for getting food into the worm is the pharynx. It has its own nervous system of
              20 neurons. Feeding behavior has been studied in the nematode Caenorhabditis
              elegans. In this project the feeding behavior of other nematodes will be
              compared to that of C elegans. The structure and function of Panagrellus
              redivivus pharyngeal neurons will be determined and compared to the known
              structure and function of C elegans pharyngeal neurons. The effects of
              differences in feeding behavior on the foods the two species can eat will be
              explored. Feeding behavior and the structure and function of the pharyngeal
              nervous system in several other bacteria-eating soil nematodes will be
              explored, to see if the lessons learned from C elegans and P redivivus can be
              extended. 

Different animals behave in different ways. For instance, dogs
              are fairly sociable animals, while cats are more solitary. Closer to home,
              chimpanzees behave very differently from humans in many ways, even though
              chimpanzees are genetically similar to humans and have quite similar brains.
              The long-term goal of this project is to find out why different animal species
              behave differently. More precisely, the goal is to find the genes that cause
              different behavior. In the even longer term, the researchers hope to get some
              idea of how behavior has evolved by comparing behavioral and genetic
              differences with the evolutionary history of the nematodes.
