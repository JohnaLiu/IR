RUI: A geomorphic trophic hypothesis for arctic lake
              productivity

Studies of controls of lake productivity have historically
              focused on the water column-the pelagic zone, emphasizing either bottom up
              physiochemical constraints, or top-down food web constraints. Neither paradigm
              is fully adequate to describe many small lakes of the world, because in shallow
              lakes, substrate-associated (benthic) primary production is important. This
              project will test the hypothesis that Arctic lake algal, invertebrate, and fish
              production, and the distribution of production between benthic and pelagic
              compartments, can be predicted based on landscape criteria, lake geomorphology,
              and food web configuration. A complete understanding of the relationships
              between landscape features, lake geomorphology, and trophic structure in
              determining both benthic and pelagic productivity is lacking for any system of
              lakes. This work will contribute substantially to the understanding of these
              relationships for shallow lakes, which are common in lake districts worldwide.
              The University of North Carolina at Greensboro is primarily an undergraduate
              institution with a substantial minority population. The proposed work will
              actively include undergraduates, providing them with opportunities to perform
              supervised projects for which they will have primary responsibility, involving
              them in all aspects of field work, and engaging them in the overall scope of
              the larger project.
