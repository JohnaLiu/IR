Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the impact of dynamic changes in the geosynchronous
              plasma sheet populations by modeling a range of magnetic storm sizes and steady
              magnetospheric convection events.  Understanding the ways in which energy moves
              into and through the inner magnetosphere or is dissipated with the
              magnetosphere-ionosphere system in response to solar wind inputs provides the
              key to predicting the resulting effects on Earth's atmosphere.  The study will
              address the role of density and temperature changes in the plasma sheet
              population, the role of penetration electric fields and long duration magnetic
              storms, the relation between convection events and small storms, and the
              contribution of the ring current to the storm energy budget and decay time
              scales.  A major goal of this study is the quantification of how the
              electrodynamics of the inner magnetosphere responds to the solar wind drivers. 
              Furthermore, the connection with ground-based magnetometer measurements,
              ionospheric current systems, and the global magnetosphere-ionosphere energy
              budget will be investigated.
