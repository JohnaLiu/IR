Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) This project promotes activities and ideas originating from
              efforts in the analytical sciences funded by the Division of Undergraduate
              Education. The report, "Curricular Developments in the Analytical Sciences,"
              issued in 1997, recommends changes in the undergraduate analytical sciences
              curriculum, including moving to a strong emphasis on problem-based learning.
              Analytical science covers not only analytical chemistry but also its
              applications in many disciplines ranging from biotechnology to
              microelectronics. This project facilitates dissemination of the results of
              these new curricular efforts through symposia, short courses, and workshops at
              professional meetings such as the Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry
              and Applied Spectroscopy, the Federation of Analytical Chemistry and Applied
              Spectroscopy Societies, the Eastern Analytical Symposium, and national and
              regional meetings of the American Chemical Society.
