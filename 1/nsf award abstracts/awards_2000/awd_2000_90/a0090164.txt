Abstract    :
              Identity politics refers to claims for resources and rights based on assertions
              of cultural difference, rather than claims based on social class or political
              party.  This dissertation research project involves a cultural anthropologist
              from the University of Texas studying how ethnic mapping projects affect the
              natural resource claims of indigenous groups on the Atlantic Coast of
              Nicaragua.  The student will study how local Miskitu and Creole communities, in
              conjunction with NGOs and other organizations, advance claims over territory
              and natural resources. The project will pay special attention to the impact
              these claims have on gender relations and other forms of intra-community
              inequality.  The tensions between indigenous and black communities, the
              relations between these communities and the state, and the intersecting
              variables of gender and class will also be studied.  The methods to be used
              include family and oral history interviews, participant observation and
              archival research, as well as GIS-based mapping.
	This research will advance
              our understanding of the so-called new social movements, bringing into focus a
              range of theoretical approaches, from post-structuralist analyses of identity
              formation to more conventional theories of ethnic and racial politics.  The new
              information to be gained from this case study will help us to understand
              similar processes of identity politics occurring throughout the world, from the
              former Yugoslavia to Chiapas, Mexico.
