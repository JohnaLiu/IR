Abstract    :
              The plant mitochondrion represents a wonderfully multifarious and dynamic
              cellular compartment that directs processes associated with energy metabolism,
              cell stress responses, several biosynthetic functions, and ultimately
              programmed cell death.  In higher plants, the genetic information contained
              within the mitochondrial compartment is organized in a multipartite, highly
              redundant configuration such that relative copy number of various DNA molecules
              can vary dramatically.  The process of copy number shifting within the plant
              mitochondrial genome is the subject of this project.  Experimental approaches
              are directed at determining the differences  in the organization of
              mitochondrial genetic information that is inherited  and mitochondrial genetic
              information that is contained in the vegetative tissues of the developing
              plant.  Likewise, investigations are focused on the nature of the genome
              structure that allows dramatic copy number changes to occur.  Because this
              laboratory has already cloned a nuclear gene that directs the copy number
              shifting phenomena in plant mitochondria, CHM,  it should be possible to deduce
              the role of this gene by characterizing mitochondrial genome shifting
              processes.  This research is likely to have implications not only for the
              manipulation of the mitochondrial genome in crop improvement and hybrid seed
              production, but also in deducing  processes involved in mitochondrial
              inheritance, an area of great interest in human genetics as well.
