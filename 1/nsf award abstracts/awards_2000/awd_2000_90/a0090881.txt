Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. Ronald Breslow in the Department of Chemistry at
              Columbia University in New York City.   The work proposed includes both the
              extension of previous work and exploration of new areas, including: 1)
              extending regioselective steroid hydroxylation to include terpenes such as
              beta-carotene, 2) exploring bis-cyclodextrin metal catalysts for ester
              hydrolysis, 3) preparing catalysts which can bind to substrates both at the
              metal and at attached cyclodextrin rings, and 4) using computer calculations to
              investigate transition state geometries and their dependence on hydrophobic
              effects.

The aim of the work to be carried out by Dr. Breslow is to
              understand and develop organic reactions in water solution, for example the
              selective hydroxylation of steroids using synthetic mimics of cytochrome P-450
              enzymes.   The molecular recognition which is required for regiospecificity and
              stereospecificity is based on hydrophobic (water avoiding) interactions of the
              substrate with the catalyst in the aqueous environment.   The work could lead
              to useful pharmaceutical applications, and is expected to provide excellent
              training for those working under Dr. Breslow's direction.
