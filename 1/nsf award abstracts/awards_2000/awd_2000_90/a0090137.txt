Identifying the mechanisms that structure communities
              is an important goal of ecology, and considerable controversy surrounds the
              importance of resources (bottom-up) versus predators (top-down).  The proposed
              research seeks to understand the ecological contexts in which alternative
              mechanisms predominate in structuring herbivore communities in salt marsh
              ecosystems, and will do so based on both observational and manipulative
              experiments.  In particular, the extent to which data support four competing
              hypotheses (bottom-up control vs. top-down control vs. joint control vs.
              environmental stress) will be evaluated with respect to a gradient in
              productivity.  Factorial field experiments will test if bottom-up effects on
              herbivores are stronger on low productivity plants whereas top-down effects on
              herbivores are stronger on high productivity plants.   Modifying densities of
              parasitoids will control top-down effects and modifying plant quality through
              additions of nitrogen and labile carbon will control bottom-up effects.  In
              addition, the proposed research will ascertain the conditions under which the
              effects of parasites cascade through the food web and affect plants, and the
              circumstances in which bottom-up effects on plants alter the rate of predation
              on herbivores by natural enemies.
