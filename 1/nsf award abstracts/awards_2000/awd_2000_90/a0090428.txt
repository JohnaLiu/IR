This is one of two
              identical proposals submitted by Washington University and Stanford University.
               A combined experimental and numerical study is proposed to examine the effect
              of elasticity on the stability of fluid-fluid displacement interfaces-sometimes
              known as the "ribbing" instability.  Such instabilities limit either the speed
              or the quality of production of adhesive coatings in industrial processes. 
              This is a collaborative effort between Bamin Khomami of Washington University
              and Eric Shaqfeh of Stanford University with the numerical part being carried
              out mainly in the former institution while the experimental part mainly at the
              latter institution. Preliminary experiments performed by the PI's showed the
              dramatic onset of such instabilities. It is hypothesized that the instability
              is caused by the unstable stress gradient created by the extensional finger
              flow near the displacing front.  The research plan is to obtain quantitative
              experimental data of such instability flows using modern instrumentation, to
              carry out linear and nonlinear stability analysis of the flows, and full
              three-dimensional simulations of the unstable elastic fluid interfaces to test
              the hypothesis.  In addition, the possibility of enhancing the stability of the
              system by introducing time-periodic parametric forcing will be examined by
              simulations.
