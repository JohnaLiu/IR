Abstract    :
              Wolbachia are inherited bacterial parasites of a large number of invertebrates.
              There has been an upsurge in research interest in these organisms in recent
              years because of their newly appreciated wide host range together with the
              array of newly discovered effects they have on the hosts they infect. These
              include inducing developmental defects such as cytoplasmic incompatibility in
              young embryos, overriding chromosomal sex-determination, inducing
              parthenogenesis and even selectively killing male hosts. This proposal plans to
              provide a research infrastructure to support this newly established and rapidly
              growing field of scientific research. This will be done through the
              establishment of an internet-based research resource for Wolbachia workers.
              This web site will collect and distribute data and resources for the
              international community of scientists working with this system. In addition
              this proposal will help to fund a series of scientific meetings aimed at
              bringing established workers in this field together with new investigators.


              This project will help to provide an important infrastructure to this emerging
              research area. It will allow for the global dissemination of data and resources
              as well as provide a forum for scientists worldwide to meet and exchange data.
              This infrastructure will promote the rapid development of this young and
              emerging area of biological research.
