This grant provides partial support for the 2001
              Gordon Research
Conference on Computational Aspects of Biomolecular NMR, to be
              held May 6-11, 2001, at the
conference center "Il Ciocco", in Barga, Italy.
              The conference chairs are Drs. David
Case and Michael Nilges. The purpose of
              the conference is to bring together scientists
working at the forefront of
              biomolecular NMR, to foster the free exchange of cutting-edge,
pre-publication
              work, and to establish directions for exploiting computation to
              solve
difficult problems in the field. Gordon Conferences provide a valuable
              means of
disseminating information and ideas in a way that cannot be achieved
              through the usual
channels of communication, that is, publications and
              presentations at large scientific
meetings. This meeting is the second of what
              is intended to be a biannual conference.
Computation plays a crucial role in
              virtually every aspect of biomolecular NMR, from data
acquisition and analysis
              to structure determination. In order to reflect the full breadth
of the field,
              a broad, multinational representation of scientists engaged in both
experiment
              and computation has been assembled. Central themes of the conference will
              be
the interdependence of experiment, theory, and computation, and the
              contributions that
computation can make to advancing the frontiers of
              biomolecular NMR. Sessions will be
devoted to new sources of structural and
              dynamical information, computer-aided assignment,
treatment of dynamic
              disorder and structural heterogeneity, intermolecular interaction and
drug
              discovery, and NMR and structural genomics.
