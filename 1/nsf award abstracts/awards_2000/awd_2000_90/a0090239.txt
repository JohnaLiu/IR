Liebl

Liebl and Seeger will use the fruit fly model to detail some
              of the
molecular machinery involved in creating a functional, correctly
              wired
central nervous system during embryogenesis.  They are
              investigating
molecular events that occur at the tip of growing axons as they
              navigate
through the central nerve cord and out to innervate the body. 
              Specifically
they will address whether an established key player, the Abl
              protein, works
in concert with two other newly identified proteins, Trio and
              Amalgam.
Genetic experiments from the Liebl and Seeger labs have shown
              suggestive
interactions between Abl and Trio, and Abl and Amalgam.  Using
              cell
biological, biochemical and further genetic methods, they ask whether
              these
proteins have any direct or indirect physical and/or
              biochemical
interaction.

This work will clearly deepen our understanding of
              the different roles the
Abl protein plays in axon tips as the central nervous
              system is first
forming.  Much similar work from fruit fly studies has been
              shown to be
directly analogous to processes that occur in mammalian nervous
              system
development.  Thus by using fruit flies to pursue such
              fundamental
questions as establishing the key players in central nervous
              system
development and understanding their interactions, these researchers
              are
likely laying the groundwork for a fuller understanding of the
              complex
processes that occur during mammalian central nervous system
              development.
