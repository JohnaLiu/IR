The Drosophila EGF receptor (EGFR) is required for a number
              of developmental processes involving distinct cell responses.  Receptor
              activity is governed by four agonists including Spitz and Vein.  The ligands
              may be deployed for particular developmental events because they induce a
              certain strength or duration of signaling and hence elicit the desired cell
              response.  Individual and comparative analysis of the ligands will be required
              to develop this idea.  The focus of this proposal is analysis of the
              neuregulin-like ligand, Vein, and a comparison of Vein with the TGF-a-like
              ligand, Spitz.  There are 3 specific aims: 1) Genetic and biochemical
              approaches will be used to identify factors that control the biological
              activity of Vein.  2) The transcriptional control of vein will be investigated
              by determining if the gene is a direct target of four signaling pathways with
              which it is known to interact.  3) Differences between Vein and Spitz will be
              analyzed by comparing the profiles of target-gene induction using DNA
              microarrays and testing the developmental consequence of substituting the spitz
              EGF motif for that of vein using homologous recombination.  Together, the
              experiments address a fundamental issue in development concerning how different
              cell responses are elicited through a single signaling pathway.  EGFR (ErbB)
              tyrosine kinases and their ligands are highly conserved and play important
              developmental roles in many organisms.  Thus, the results found here will have
              implications beyond Drosophila.
