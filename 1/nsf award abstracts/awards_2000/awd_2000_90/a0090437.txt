This award is to Morgan State University to support
              the activity described below for 24 months.  The proposal was submitted in
              response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF
              0082).

Partners
The partners for this award include Morgan State
              University; Maryland Technology Development Corporation; Baltimore Development
              Corporation's Emerging Technology Center; Chesapeake Bay Regional Technical
              Center of Excellence; Prince George's County Economic Development
              Corporation.

Proposed Activities
The activities include technology
              transfer; business incubation; education and workforce development;
              strengthening local economies in targeted economically distressed communities;
              utilization of science and technology of federal laboratories in
              Maryland.

Proposed Innovation
The innovation goals are creation of economic
              wealth through technology transfer of research and development in the
              universities and federal laboratories in Maryland to create new companies and
              new jobs; creation of infrastructure to enable innovation; strong emphasis on
              education and training.

Potential Economic Impact
The activities will
              provide general economic well being in both rural (Maryland Eastern Shore) and
              urban (Baltimore and Prince George County) areas to reach under-represented
              groups.

Potential Societal Impact
The potential benefits to society include
              involvement of under-represented groups in the innovation enterprise in both
              rural and urban areas by creating new companies and new jobs for the
              disadvantaged and provision of the needed training to enable innovation and
              empower people to create economic well being; higher paying jobs in the
              region.
