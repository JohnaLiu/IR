Abstract    :
              This 12-month planning phase will prepare the Exploratorium to develop a major
              collection of exhibits and activities on human thought and behavior.  Because
              of the abundance of dramatic, new scientific research in human cognition and
              how this topic can be explored in an informal setting by the public, the
              institution will perform a one-year research and planning project.

The team
              will investigate work by other science centers through site visits, conduct
              audience research on their needs in learning about cognitive science, consult
              with advisors, develop and test exhibit prototypes and evaluate the
              process.
