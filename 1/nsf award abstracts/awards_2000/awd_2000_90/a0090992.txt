Abstract    :
              This award will provide funds for the support of a workshop on thermobaric
              instability in the ocean, to be held at the Naval Postgraduate School in
              October 2000.  Thermobaric instability refers to the fact that the
              compressibility of sea water is a non-linear function of pressure, so that a
              colder and fresher layer overlying a warmer and saltier layer may be statically
              stable, but become unstable if it is disturbed.  That this effect is
              theoretically possible has been known for a long time, but only recently has it
              been considered as an effect that could actually occur in the Southern Ocean,
              specifically as the potential explanation of the episodic occurrence of
              polynyas in the Weddell Sea.

The objective of the workshop is to bring
              together a group of oceanographers with expertise in the thermodynamics of sea
              water on the one hand and experience in studying the structure and
              characteristics of the Weddell Sea on the other hand, to explore the relevance
              of thermobaric instability to antarctic upper ocean dynamics, and to test it
              along with competing theories in explaining the observed ice and ocean
              phenomena of the Weddell Sea.

Observations from recent oceanographic
              cruises, particularly those of the Antarctic Flux Study of 1997, when
              integrated into a simple upper ocean/ice model, have indicated that much of the
              eastern Weddell Sea is susceptible to thermobaric instability by the end of the
              austral winter.  It follows that thermobaric effects may play an important role
              in the overall water column stability in the Weddell Sea and other regions of
              the Southern Ocean, may feed into the multi-year time scale of the Antarctic
              Circumpolar Wave, and may affect the overturning and ventilation of the high
              latitude ocean at even longer climatic time scales.

A formal workshop on
              this specific aspect of antarctic oceanography has not been convened before.
