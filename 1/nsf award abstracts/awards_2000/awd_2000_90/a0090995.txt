Abstract    :
              Steroid compounds are well-known as hormones, and they have several actions in
              the brain itself.  Recent discoveries showed that steroid hormone synthesis
              occurs in the central nervous system, and that steroid products regulate
              development and functional maturation of neurons (nerve cells) in the brain. 
              The genes for synthesizing steroids in the brain are differentially generated
              compared with those in the adrenal gland or gonads.  This project uses
              molecular and genetic approaches, including novel genetic knock-out mouse
              strains, to examine in vivo how some of the genes in the brain are regulated
              that encode steroidogenic enzymes, and how some of the steroids regulate
              neuronal development and function in rodents.
   Results will be important for
              a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating cellular
              differentiation during brain development, and so will have an impact beyond
              neuroendocrinolgy to developmental biology.  The project also provides
              excellent training some of using the latest genetic technology.
