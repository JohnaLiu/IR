Abstract    :
              Future changes in the global carbon balance and associated feedbacks to climate
              will depend on ecosystem responses to multiple, interacting drivers of global
              change, such as elevated CO2, temperature, N deposition and changes in the
              amount and timing of precipitation.   Efforts to predict these interactions
              with modeling approaches have been limited by a lack of relevant experimental
              data, as well as the absence of mechanisms for rapid communication between
              modelers and experimentalists. This grant will establish a network of global
              change scientists in an initiative on Terrestrial Ecosystem Responses to
              Atmospheric and Climatic Change (TERACC), with the aim to (1) integrate and
              synthesize existing whole-ecosystem research on ecosystem responses to
              individual global change drivers, (2) foster new research on whole-ecosystem
              responses to the combined effects of elevated atmospheric CO2, warming, and
              other aspects of global change, and (3) promote better communication and
              integration between experimentalists and modelers.  TERACC activities will
              focus primarily on a series of directed, interactive workshops, but will also
              include database management and educational activities.
