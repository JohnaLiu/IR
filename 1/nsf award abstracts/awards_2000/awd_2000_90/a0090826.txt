Abstract    :
              The cell was discovered in the C17th by the Dutch scientist van
              Leeuwenhoek
when he invented the microscope. The use of lenses and microscopes
              to make
scientific observations has had a profound effect on man's history and
              his
understanding. The discoveries of Galileo, Newton and Einstein are the
              best
examples of this. The 1990s were declared the decade of the brain and
              by
coincidence, in 1990 a new microscope was invented which allowed
              scientists
to see far deeper and more clearly into (brain) tissue than ever
              before.
This grant is concerned with the development of new chemical compounds
              that
will exploit the unique advantages of this microscope for the very
              first
time. Specifically, we will use organic chemistry to make
              the
neurotransmitters that are biologically inert until they are activated
              by
light. These molecules can be used to release the neurotransmitter
              deep
inside cells and so stimulate a single synapse in the brain in
              a
reproducible and precisely controlled way. The synapse is the basic unit
              of
all the electrical circuits in the brain. The ability to use these
              chemicals
to stimulate single synapses in living brains (from mammals such as
              rats or
mice) will allow us to start to develop realistic theories of the
              basic
molecular and cellular mechanisms which underlie neuronal network
              formation,
learning and memory.
