Abstract    :
              This award renews partial support for the Bacteriology Collection of the
              American Type Culture Collection.  The Collection, which currently consists of
              approximately 15,400 bacteria and bacteriophage, is perhaps the most diverse
              assemblage of Prokaryotes in the world. Approximately a third of the
              Collection's holdings have been accessioned using the support provided by NSF
              since 1974. Sample cultures of the collected organisms are provided to the
              scientific community on request for a modest charge. Although support is
              provided by other federal agencies as well as by NSF, user fees represent the
              largest single source of income for operation of the Collection.  

The
              sample cultures provided to researchers, educators and others are used in a
              variety of applications in basic and applied research, education and
              manufacturing procedures. Authentication and internal quality control
              activities represent a significant portion of the activities connected with
              collection maintenance.  The majority of the strains have been identified and
              verified extensively by a suite of physiological, morphological, cytochemical,
              and genotypic characteristics specific to a given species.
