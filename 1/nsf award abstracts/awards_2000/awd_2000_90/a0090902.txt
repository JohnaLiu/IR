Abstract    :
              A symposium titled "New Frontiers in Functional Morphology of Molluscs," will be
              held at the second meeting of the World Congress of Malacology, in Vienna,
              Austria, in August 2001.  The symposium will honor Drs. Vera Fretter and Ruth
              Turner, two outstanding women scientists who made significant contributions to
              the study of form and function of molluscs and laid the groundwork for a
              growing field of functional morphology research.  The goal of the symposium is
              to focus attention on the vast potential of the use of molluscs as model
              systems in the study of form and function by providing a forum for putting
              forward new ideas and approaches, and proposing directions for future study. 
              Symposium topics will range from bivalve and gastropod feeding processes to
              swimming mechanics in squid.  This symposium will draw attention to the study
              of functional morphology, highlight new, innovative areas of research, and
              rejuvenate the field among the international group of malacologists who will be
              attending the World Congress.
