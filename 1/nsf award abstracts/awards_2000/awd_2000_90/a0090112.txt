This award supports Professor John L. Lewis, Department of
              Mathematics, University of Kentucky, to conduct collaborative research with
              Professor Hi Jun Choe of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology
              in the area of nonlinear partial differential equations.  This joint study will
              investigate the regularity and uniqueness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes
              equations.  Because many physical problems can be described in the language of
              partial differential equations, theoretical study of such equations can lead to
              a variety of technological advances.  Exchange visits by Professors Lewis and
              Choe to each others departments will allow them to combine complementary skills
              and expertise in addressing this important mathematical problem.
