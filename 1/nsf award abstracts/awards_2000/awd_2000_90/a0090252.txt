Abstract    :
              0090252
Inadequate long-term durability of civil engineering
infrastructure
              has been a major problem with enormous
economic loss to many countries.  So
              far, progress
towards solving the problem has been hampered by the
lack of
              mathematical approaches among classical-type
durability researches, and lack
              of interest or
understanding of the qualitative mechanisms
              among
mathematician and mechanicians.  The Workshop will
stimulate dialog
              between these two groups.  The
workshop will be held at Czech Technical
              University,
Prague, in March or April 2002.  Duration of the
Workshop is
              planned to be 2.5 to 3 days.  About 40
participants are expected, of which 15
              to 20 will be
from the U.S. Complementary funding from NATO and from
local
              sources in Prague will be applied.***
