Abstract    :
              The goal of this study is to develop a general theory of the spread and
              maintenance of communicable diseases in spatially heterogeneous populations. 
              The theory will be developed and tested in the context of bovine tuberculosis
              (BTB) in the African buffalo population in the Kruger National Park (KNP),
              South Africa, as well as the spill-over of this disease to cattle and humans
              living on the boundaries of KNP.  The study involves collecting BTB prevalence
              and strain data from sputum and blood samples taken from immobilized buffalo,
              some of which will be marked and collared for radio tracking studies of the
              movement of individuals between herds and the movement of herds over the
              landscape.  The data will be incorporated into a spatially explicit and
              ecologically detailed predictive model that will then used to test theory and
              evaluate management alternatives such as vaccination, removal of infected
              individuals, and the maintenance of different strains of the diseases under
              particular treatment regimes.  

The study will provide further insights into
              tuberculosis, which is a serious problem in humans that is exacerbated by the
              current AIDS epidemic in Africa and the emergence of drug resistant strains. 
              It will also provide insights into factors controlling the spread of other
              communicable diseases such as HIV itself.
