Abstract    :
              The natural environment varies considerably from place to place, and in time.
              Some of this variation is natural (e.g., altitudinal and latitudinal gradients
              in temperature) and some of it is induced by human activities (e.g., urban
              temperature effects, global climatic changes). This study will investigate the
              ability of a model insect, the striped ground cricket Allonemobius socius, to
              plastically adjust its life cycle to meet the challenges of climatic variation
              in space and time. This study will also determine the genetic basis for this
              plasticity. Genetic variation will be investigated both among populations along
              altitudinal and latitudinal clines and within populations that are expected to
              vary in their ability to plastically respond to environmental change. This
              study will provide valuable information concerning adaptive evolutionary
              responses to past environmental changes. In addition, by characterizing the
              amount of genetic variation that exists within populations it will be possible
              to predict the rate of adaptive response to future changes in climate.
