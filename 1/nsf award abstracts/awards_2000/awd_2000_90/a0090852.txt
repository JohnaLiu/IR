Abstract    :
                 Regulation of reproduction is controlled by hormones, and an important one
              for all vertebrates is gonadotropin-releasing hormone, GnRH.  Studies in recent
              years on the jawless vertebrate called the lamprey, representing the most
              primitive lineage of vertebrates, show that its GnRH has more than one
              molecular form.  This project utilizes molecular techniques and
              immunocytochemical staining to isolate and characterize the genomic sequences
              that encode two of these forms, and the molecular receptor molecules on cells
              in the brain that respond to GnRH.  Results will tell whether lamprey GnRHs
              share common functional and developmental features with the GnRH found in other
              vertebrates, and how these multiple forms of GnRH are used by lampreys to
              regulate reproduction.  The comparative approach allows inferences about how
              the control of reproduction arose in the evolution of vertebrates.
    This
              project will increase our understanding of reproductive control and how it
              evolved, and so will have an impact beyond neuroscience on endocrinology and
              vertebrate biology in general. This project also has potential for developing
              controls for a predatory animal that affects commercial fisheries, has strongly
              integrated educational and training opportunities for graduate and
              undergraduate students, and has a strong component of international
              collaboration.
