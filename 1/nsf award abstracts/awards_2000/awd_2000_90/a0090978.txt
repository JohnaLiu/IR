Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on
              developing technology for semi-automatically creating wrappers that extract
              data from semi-structured web pages.  The key innovation is a bootstrapping
              method for wrapper generation, so that experience in wrapping previous sites
              can be automatically re-used to minimize the effort required to wrap new sites.
               The proposed technology will make it practical to create thousands of highly
              accurate wrappers almost completely automatically, creating new opportunities
              for web-based information integration.

The proposed technology will enable
              Fetch Technologies to scale our current wrapper generation technology far
              beyond what his now practical.  Thousands of Internet services create value for
              their users by aggregating and integrating information from Internet sources. 
              The proposed technology will make these types of services radically simpler to
              implement.  Applications include portal sites, comparison shopping services,
              auction sites, finance integration, and competitive intelligence-gathering
              services.
