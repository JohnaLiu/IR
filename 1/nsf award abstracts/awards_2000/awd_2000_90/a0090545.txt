Abstract    :
              The Earth's aurora emits a wide range and variety of radio waves at low, medium,
              and high frequencies, which are signatures of the interaction between the
              auroral electron beam and the ionospheric plasma.  Such interactions and their
              results, for example plasma wave generation mechanisms, are currently not well
              understood.  This project will deploy a versatile electromagnetic wave form
              receiver at South Pole station, and focus on several types of signals
              detectable at ground level.  An Antarctic location is essential for this study
              because in the Northern Hemisphere the low and medium frequency spectrum is
              obscured by broadcast bands.  The clean Antarctic spectrum improves the
              effectiveness of automatic wave detection algorithms which are a necessary part
              of the data management protocol.  This receiver will form part of a network of
              receivers located in the Automatic Geophysical Observatories operated by the
              US. Antarctic program and by the British Antarctic Survey, thus providing
              coverage at a wide range of geomagnetic latitudes.
