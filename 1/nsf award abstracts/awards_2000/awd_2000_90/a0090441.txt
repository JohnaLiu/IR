Abstract    :
              In this project in the Advanced Materials and Processing Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Dr. Michael Krische of the Department of Chemistry and
              Biochemistry of the University of Texas at Austin will design and synthesize
              conjugated macromolecular structures formed by interstrand hydrogen bonding. 
              Co-facial alternate stacking of bis-thiophene and fluorene chromophores will
              produce stable conducting materials with efficient charge transport properties.
               Using other starting materials, duplex macromolecular materials may be
              synthesized for applications in molecular storage devices, catalysts and
              self-replicators.  Planned centralized organic chemistry centers with 'virtual'
              (on-line) and 'real' accessibility will provide the undergraduate students with
              instructional materials and career development opportunities including graduate
              programs and job openings.

Abiotic duplex polymer structures modeled after
              DNA will be synthesized using different starting materials.  These
              macromolecular structures formed by inter-molecular hydrogen bonding will be
              useful as conducting materials with high charge transfer properties. 
              Centralized learning centers in the chemistry department with on-line
              accessibility will be a new instructional tool to students in materials
              chemistry.
