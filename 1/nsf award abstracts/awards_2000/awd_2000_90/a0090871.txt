Abstract    :
              The proposed research will seek to develop new bond-forming methodology by
              investigating the reactivity and selectivity of nucleophilic carbenes.  The
              synthetic applications of this novel methodology will be illustrated by
              synthesis of several polycyclic compounds.  Efforts to develop solid
              support-based synthesis using nucleophilic carbenes as key elements are also
              planned.

With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the
              research of Professor James H. Rigby of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne
              State University.  Professor Rigby's studies are directed towards the
              development of new bond-forming reactions with precise control over the
              detailed three-dimensional structure (stereochemistry).  This new synthetic
              methodology will add to the roster of bond-forming reactions available to the
              synthetic organic chemist and is most likely to be useful in the preparation of
              pharmaceutical and/or agricultural agents.  Students trained in this area will
              learn skills to solve problems pertaining to synthetic organic chemistry in the
              specialty chemical or pharmaceutical industries.
