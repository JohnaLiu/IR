Title:  Out of the Loop: Why Are So Few
              Underrepresented Minority High School Students Learning Computer
              Science

This CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests
              funds to study why so few male and female African American and Hispanic
              students are studying computer science at the high school level.  Specifically,
              the study will examine the decisions of college-bound African American and
              Hispanic students to take (or not take), persist (or not persist) in computer
              science courses beyond the introductory level.  The research model considers
              the interplay between the high school educational environment and the
              psychological and cultural factors that affect male and female underrepresented
              minority students' interest in learning computer science.  The sites of the
              investigation are schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District.  This
              project has the potential to provide valuable insights about how to attract
              underrepresented minorities to IT classes in high school and college.
