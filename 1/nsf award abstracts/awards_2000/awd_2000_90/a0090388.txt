Abstract    :
                   Nationwide there are only a few opportunities for upper-level
              undergraduates and beginning graduate students to gain experience in summer
              courses in neuroscience research.  To make an opportunity available in the
              southeastern United States, a summer course was started at the Dauphin Island
              Sea Lab in Alabama in 1997, which can exploit the availability of simple marine
              organisms for introductory experiments.  This lab has excellent classroom and
              laboratory facilities with a research-quality library, and dormitory living. 
              The summer course provides an introduction to neuroscience and behavior, and
              has enrolled 10-15 students per year.  This award provides funds for additional
              laboratory equipment for the course to meet the increasing student demand.
   
               The impact of this course upgrade will be in enabling more students in a new
              geographical area to gain experience with laboratory research techniques, and
              in fostering their potential career choices.
