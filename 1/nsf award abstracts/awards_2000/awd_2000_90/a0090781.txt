A workshop will be convened for geoscience educators and
              employers to determine guidelines for the design, content, and implementation
              of geoscience human-resources surveys.  The workshop will focus specifically on
              what human-resources data are needed and by whom, the best methods to obtain
              the data, and how to disseminate the data most effectively.  Workshop
              participants will b selected from the following groups: college and university
              geoscience faculty (representing institutions that are public and private,
              large and small, undergraduate and comprehensive, and regionally diverse),
              college and university deans and university career counselors, traditional
              employers of geoscientists (petroleum industry, mining and minerals industry,
              federal and state governments, environmental consulting firms, and academia),
              non-traditional employers of geoscientists (law, journalism, finance,
              computer/Information Technology), representatives fro, other science societies
              with ongoing survey programs, representatives from professional geoscience
              societies, and students.
