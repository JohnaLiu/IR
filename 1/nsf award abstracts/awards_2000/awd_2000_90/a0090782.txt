Abstract    :
              Molecular biology and genomic sciences  are dependent on bioinformatics for
              access to data, analyses and knowledge bases.  IUBio Archive is an internet
              information resource for biology data and software.  It will be expanded and
              enhanced to include open-source sequence analysis tools, phylogenetic tools, a
              framework for analysis tools on a web server and continued archiving of Bionet
              news.  Until now, this has been an entirely volunteer effort.  BIO-Mirror is an
              international collaboration for high-speed world-wide mirroring of public
              bioinformatics data set using Internet2 infrastructure.  In addition to the 30
              Gigabytes of DNA and protein sequence and structure data, new additions will
              include metabolic pathways and structures.  The server tool extension will be
              modular and portable, so that other bioinformatics centers may use them.
