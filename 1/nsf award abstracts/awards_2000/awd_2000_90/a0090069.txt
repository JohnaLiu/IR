Linking leaf and root traits to ecosystem structure and
              function in a common garden study of 14 temperate tree species

Natural
              ecosystems are dynamic, not static.  For instance, plants themselves alter
              properties of soils and ecosystems.  Thus, the characteristics of different
              plant species influence important ecosystem functions such as soil fertility,
              soil development and plant productivity, and thus in part control ecosystem
              functioning.  The specifics of these controls, however, are very poorly
              understood due to difficulties in separating effects of climate or soils from
              those of vegetation.  To explore the way in which plants can influence their
              own environment, the investigators will use a common-garden experiment of
              32-year old monoculture stands of 14 temperate tree species in Poland.  This is
              the only such experiment in the world. The long-range goals of the overall
              effort include examining: above and belowground tissue physiology and
              productivity; decomposition; soil N and C cycling; soil chemistry and
              pedogenesis; and integrated modeling. This project will focus on measuring the
              phenology of roots and foliage, and the associated turnover rates and
              fluxes.
