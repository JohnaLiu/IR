Abstract    :
              This award provides NSF support for a planning grant to help New Mexico set
              priorities for the improvement of its basic science and engineering
              infrastructure.  Planning activities will include 1) construction of databases
              to document the current and potential state of research competitiveness in New
              Mexico's six universities, 2) cataloging of barriers that must be surmounted
              for promising University programs in science and engineering to develop into
              nationally and internationally recognized centers of excellence, 3) developing
              a ten-year implementation strategy to improve New Mexico's science and
              engineering research base. 
This planning grant will collect data, establish a
              state steering committee, select targeted EPSCoR research themes and
              subprograms, and develop a process for selecting a state EPSCoR Project
              Director(s). The planning activity is excepted to result in submission of an
              EPSCoR Implementation Proposal for sustainable infrastructure improvements
              which will enable New Mexico researchers to more effectively compete for
              federal and private R&D funding.
