              Lay Abstract (0090451)

     The means by which large numbers of neurons
              (ensembles) effectively
interact is not well understood. Recent findings
              demonstrate thousands of
hippocampal neurons participating in specific
              fast-frequency patterns
[theta-modulated gamma (40-100 Hz) and sharp wave
              modulated ripples (200
Hz)]. These in vivo patterns likely support the memory
              functions performed
by the hippocampus and interconnected structures (e.g.
              medial septum).
Local application of drugs into the medial septum of rats will
              be used to
manipulate both memory formation and hippocampal electrophysiology.
              This
project will determine the role of septal neurons in regulating gamma
              and
ripple frequency patterns and the relation between these ensemble
              patterns
and memory.
     The medial septum and the hippocampus are brain
              structures critical
for episodic memory formation.  While the functions
              supported by particular
brain structures are fairly well understood, how large
              numbers of neurons
effectively interact to support emergent function is not. 
              The hippocampus
exhibits specific patterns of activity during which thousands
              of neurons
discharge in transient gamma (40-100 Hz) and ripple (200 Hz)
              frequency
patterns.  These patterns may play a role in organizing the
              discharge of
individual neurons into ensemble patterns, similar to the manner
              in which
the precise timing of miniature lights on a large scoreboard can
              create a
coherent message or picture. What role these organizing patterns
              actually
play in memory formation is not yet known.  This project will
              manipulate
gamma and ripple frequency patterns, and determine the effect on
              memory
formation.  The results are likely to advance understanding of
              the
function of fast-frequency ensemble patterns.
