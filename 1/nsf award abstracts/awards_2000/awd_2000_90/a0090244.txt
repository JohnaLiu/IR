Abstract    :
              In a world full of inequality, rapid transportation and communication,
              citizenship as a social status is a valuable resource in wealthier places.  In
              the western world problems of citizenship tend to be colored by ethnic and
              nationality differences.  This dissertation research by an anthropology student
              from Harvard University will study citizenship in Hong Kong, where migrants
              from the People's Republic of China have the same ethnicity and nationality,
              yet face serious problems of attaining citizenship.  Using methods of
              ethnographic research, analysis of court cases, archival research with
              government documents, newspapers, participant observation, and interviews with
              government functionaries as well as long-time citizen residents, the student
              will study the lived experiences immigrants.  The time-consuming bureaucratic
              delays and barriers to adaptation and integration, which have been exacerbated
              by the recent economic crisis in Asia, will be analyed as they have developed
              since colonial days.  This research will contribute to general theory about
              entitlement and migration, will add to the PIs knowledge of this important
              region of the world, and will help train a young social scientist.
