Abstract    :
              Automation of a given design process requires an algorithmic analysis of it. The
              availability of fast and easily implementable algorithms is essential to the
              discipline. This proposal focuses on the physical design problems and their
              interaction with higher and lower-levels of the design hierarchy. Two classes
              of problems are being studied. First, the interaction between various cost
              functions in the placement problem is being investigated.  In particular,
              relationship among net-cut, wirelength, congestion, and timing is being
              researched. Next, the class of algorithmic predictors and statistical
              predictors are being studied.  One goal of this project is to show that it is
              possible to obtain accurate prediction very fast using floorplan and placement
              predictors. CAD tools associated with the above projects are under
              development.
