This award supports continuation of a US-France cooperative
              research project on ultrafast lasers between the NSF Science and Technology
              Center for Ultrafast Optical Science (CUOS) at the University of Michigan,
              directed by Gerard A. Mourou, and the Laboratory for Applied Optics, French
              National Center for Scientific Research at the Ecole Polytechnique, directed by
              Daniele Hulin.  The groups will continue to collaborate on the development of
              next generation ultraintense lasers, in particular, aspects of high peak power,
              spatial and temporal beam quality, and new amplifying media. In this next
              phase, the groups will: (1) extend and characterize harmonic generation to the
              water window with good efficiency; (2) combine their efforts on electron
              acceleration and injection using Laser Wakefield Acceleration techniques.
              

The collaboration will be pursued through an exchange of US and French
              postdoctoral researchers.  Both sides will benefit from complementary expertise
              and facilities and will advance applications of ultrahigh laser intensities to
              new fields of physics research.

This award is co-supported by the Division
              of International Programs in the Directorate for Social, Behaviorial, and
              Economics Sciences and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the
              Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
