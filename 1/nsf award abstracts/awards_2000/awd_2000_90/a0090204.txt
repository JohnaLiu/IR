Abstract    :
              Collaborative research between investigators at Miami University and Ohio State
              University will focus on physiological and ecological mechanisms used by
              insects for winter survival.  Many overwintering insects are exposed
              simultaneously to cold and desiccating conditions.  Since both freezing and
              desiccation subject cells to drying, the goal of this research is to determine
              whether physiological responses to these stresses are similar.  Using two
              insect models, one species that cannot tolerate freezing (a flesh fly) and one
              that tolerates extensive internal freezing (a gall fly larvae), the
              investigators will conduct a series of field and laboratory studies to
              determine the limits of organismal and cellular survival in relation to
              protective physiological responses including ion regulation and stress
              proteins.  The results of these studies may indicate whether adaptations
              protecting against desiccation stress could have given rise to the evolution of
              insect cold-hardiness.  Furthermore, this work may provide new tools both for
              the disruption of insect pest populations, and for the long-term storage of
              insects and other organisms at low temperature.
