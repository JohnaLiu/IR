This award will provide partial support for speakers and others
              at
semiannual conferences in the series known as the ``Cascade
              Topology
Seminar,'' over a three-year period beginning in 2001.
              These
conferences will be held at various universities in the
              northwestern
United States and southwestern Canada, including the Universities
              of
Oregon, Washington, and Puget Sound, and Boise, Portland, and Oregon
State
              Universities.  Typically there will be half a dozen principal
speakers on
              topics ranging widely over geometry and topology, the
majority from outside
              the home institutions of the Seminar, and more
than fifty participants
              altogether, roughly half of them faculty and
half of them graduate students,
              as well as an occasional undergraduate
student. Participation by younger
              mathematicians, by women, and by
underrepresented minorities is
              encouraged.

The mathematics presented in meetings of the Cascade Topology
              Seminar
ranges widely over topology and geometry.  Topological issues
              include
algebraic and geometric methods for describing and
              characterizing
spatial problems such as the challenge of recognizing whether
              two
knotted curves in three-space are essentially identical. 
              Geometric
topics addressed in the Seminar include differential geometry,
              which
emphasizes measures of the curvature of spaces and the consequences
              of
curvature for analytic problems, as well as algebraic geometry, which
has
              its roots in the study of families of solutions to
              polynomial
equations.
