Abstract    :
                  A fundamental question in neuroscience is how natural sensory stimuli are
              encoded for information handling by the brain.  Invertebrate animals often
              offer systems that are in some ways simpler than those of mammals, and
              including such features as identifiable single cells in networks of relatively
              few numbers.  This collaborative project exploits a sensory system called the
              cercal system of the cricket, in which small appendages on the rear of the body
              contain fine hairs that are used to detect, identify and localize behaviorally
              relevant air current movements, such as those produced by a predator.  The
              input from roughly 2000 receptor cells converges on 30 local interneurons and
              only 20 output interneurons that lead to behavior such as escape.  Three
              collaborators at two institutions use computational and mathematical analyses
              of a database of anatomical and physiological measurements on the 'dynamic map'
              that does the central processing in the brain of the peripheral signals.  The
              goals are to characterize the representation of dynamic sensory stimulus
              parameters at two processing stages within the mapped sensory system, and to
              examine the mechanisms that transform the representation at the interface
              between these two processing stages.
   Results will be important for our
              understanding of information representation in nervous systems, particularly in
              dynamic processing.  The project also will enhance the independent career of a
              woman faculty member in mathematics, and students will receive
              multi-disciplinary, highly quantitative training related to biology, in two
              states that do not currently have high profiles in federally funded research.
