Abstract    :
              Juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) helps to regulate the titer of juvenile hormone
              and, hence, larval development in insects. JHE is actively removed from
              hemolymph by athrocytes that maintain appropriate hemolymph composition, and is
              degraded in lysosomes. A binding protein, P29, binds JHE in athrocytes and
              appears to be important for appropriate processing of JHE in these cells. Dr.
              Bonning aims to identify the mechanism(s) by which P29 affects the trafficking
              and degradation of JHE. To do this she will use both the tobacco hornworm
              Manduca sexta and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster in experiments designed
              to determine the intracellular location of P29, and the location of interaction
              of P29 with JHE. The specific functions of P29 with respect to JHE will then be
              elucidated by using mutant lines of D. melanogaster and RNA interference to
              prevent the interaction of the two proteins. The effects of disruption of P29
              binding to JHE on the clearance and turnover of JHE will be observed. New
              knowledge about the nature and function of P29 will enhance our knowledge of
              protein trafficking and could facilitate development of novel approaches to
              insect pest control.
