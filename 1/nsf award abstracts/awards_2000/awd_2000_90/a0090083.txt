              ABSTRACT

PI: Christine S. Grant 
Institution: North Carolina State
              University
Proposal Number: 0090083


This grant will provide funding for a
              workshop aimed increasing the representation of minority faculty in chemical
              engineering and related disciplines.  The workshop will bring together faculty
              and advanced Ph.D. candidates and will have two express goals:
1. Provide a
              forum for aspiring minority faculty currently in Ph.D. programs to network with
              mid-career minority faculty and to meet program officers at NSF and other
              agencies in the DC area.
2. Provide a forum for mid-career minority faculty to
              initiate collaborative research with aspiring minority faculty, with each
              other, and with various funding agencies.  The workshop will also provide
              information on career options for mid-career faculty.

It is anticipated that
              this forum will help alleviate fears and concerns among aspiring minority
              candidates about the recruiting process and encourage them to pursue careers in
              academia.  They will also be presented with information about the rigors and
              trials of an academic career before they start working and the tenure clock
              starts.  The program is being designed by and for minority faculty so that they
              can help each other and reduce the disparity between minority and majority
              faculty at various stages of their careers.

The workshop will consist
              of:
1. Panel discussions
2. Research presentations and poster sections
3.
              Meetings with NSF and other funding agency program directors
4. Overview
              presentations of research funding opportunities at NSF and other funding
              agencies
5. Presentations and discussions of results of a Participant Career
              Development Survey
6. Structured opportunities for mentoring and
              collaboration.
