Current understandings of cell differentiation and pattern
              formation in animals have largely been based on data obtained from 'model'
              systems such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogastor.  The extent to which
              developmental mechanisms operating in the fly are conserved in other phyla is
              at present unknown.  This question will be addressed by examining annelid
              homologues of fly developmental regulatory genes and their role in the
              diversification of body plans.  

In all animals that have been studied to
              date, the Hox gene cluster is responsible for determining regional identity
              along the anterior-posterior body axis.  The upstream regulation of this gene
              cluster points to a potential source of morphological variation between body
              plans.  Knowledge of Hox gene regulation beyond Drosophila is limited. 
              Therefore, the specific aim is to identify in annelids homologues to fly genes
              which have been shown to regulate Hox gene expression.  The homologues to two
              Drosophila segmentation genes, hunchback and caudal , in  both leeches and in
              polychaetes will be characterized.   This comparative approach will allow us to
              differentiate between general developmental mechanisms and phylum-specific
              ones, in so doing providing novel insights into the formation and regional
              specification of the annelid embryo.
