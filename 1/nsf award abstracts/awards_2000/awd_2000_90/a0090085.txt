This dissertation research by an anthropological linguist studies the language
              used by Jewish and Palestinian Israeli and West Bank Palestinian woman peace
              and political activists.  While the rhetoric used appeals to gender unity, the
              actual practices of coalition building reveal divisions of inequality both
              within and between groups. The focus of the research will be on how people
              manipulate specific linguistic structures (how things are said) and not simply
              semantic content (what is said) in order to negotiate identities and goals. The
              student will record speech in organizational meetings and public events, as
              well as interview activists, individually and in small groups, to gather
              demographic information, gender and national ideologies.  She will test
              hypotheses concerned with how women's attempts to create a cohesive women's
              activist community correlate with their ability to maximize gendered language
              practices within Israeli Hebrew and Palestinian Arabic; and with how
              code-switching (switching between two or more languages or dialects) is used to
              attain personal and political goals. The research should advance our
              understanding of how linguistic structure and practice affects political
              activity and will further our understanding of the ways in which Israeli and
              Palestinian women peace and national activists translate international
              phenomena, such as peace treaties and global feminism, into local realities of
              building or failing to build bridges across boundaries of difference to achieve
              common goals.  In addition it will add to our knowledge of this important
              region of the world
