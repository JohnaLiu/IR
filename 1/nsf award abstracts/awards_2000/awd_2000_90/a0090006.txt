Title:  Information Technology Pathways in Academe: Identifying
              Barriers for Women and Minority Students

This CISE Information Technology
              Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to study the factors that contribute to
              the small numbers of women and underrepresented minorities who obtain degrees
              in computer science (CS) and computer engineering (CE) at a major research
              university.  Both quantitative and qualitative protocols will be used to
              determine why diverse students do not elect to follow academic career paths in
              CS and CE fields.  Specifically, the project will consist of five parts: the
              Academic/Career Pathways Study, the Student Perceptions and Perspective Study,
              the Student Beliefs and Attitudes Study, the Course-taking Pattern and
              Retention Study, and the Faculty Perceptions and Attitudes Study.   The first
              four studies will also look at the influence of program interventions such as
              the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program and the Women in Science and
              Engineering Residence Program.  This project has the potential to provide
              valuable insights into the recruitment and retention of women and
              underrepresented minorities in IT majors.
