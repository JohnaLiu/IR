Abstract    :
              The objective of this research project, carried out by Professor Gary Blanchard
              and his coworkers at Michigan State University, is to develop ways to control
              the density and distribution of reactive functional groups at interfaces.  A
              synthetic approach using polymeric molecular layers is used to control the
              density and distribution of interface functionalities.  Optical probes,
              including picosecond lifetime measurements, molecular reorientation and
              isomerization measurements, and surface second harmonic generation intensity
              and imaging measurements are used to characterize the synthesized interfaces. 
              With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, the results
              of this research provide an enabling foundation for future understanding of the
              chemistry of structurally complex surfaces. 

Synthesis and characterization
              of complex interfaces is the focus of this research project carried out with
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program support.  Polymeric synthetic
              approaches coupled with state of the art optical characterization provides
              detailed fundamental information about the distribution, type, and density of
              chemical functionalities at these complex interfaces.
