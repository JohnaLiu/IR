Abstract    :
              Post Occupancy Evaluations have been used to provide technical feedback to
              designers, developers, owners, operations, tenants and researchers following
              completion of newly constructed buildings and provide a basis for identifying
              research needs.  They are an invaluable source of information for improving the
              design and performance of buildings.  Surveys allow designers, developers,
              owners, operators and tenants to objectively gauge which building services and
              design features are working and which aren't.  This project will evaluate
              whether a new, web-based survey instrument can provide these groups with a more
              robust performance analysis at a lower cost than existing methods.
