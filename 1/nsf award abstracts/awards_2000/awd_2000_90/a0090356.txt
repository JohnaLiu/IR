This award supports Professors Claude Cohen and Michael L.
              Shuler, Department of Chemical Engineering, Cornell University, to conduct
              collaborative research with Professor K.D. Suh of Hanyang University and Dr.
              J.Y. Kim of Samchok National University, Korea.  This joint project aims to
              synthesize and physically characterize the properties of ionomer polymer
              networks.  Incorporation of a small concentration of ions into the chemical
              structure of polymer chains can greatly influence physical behavior.  This
              study on the effects of precursor molecular weight, ion content, nature and
              concentration of the solvent during crosslinking, and pendent defects will
              serve as a basis for a fundamental understanding of the structure-property
              relations of ionomer networks and for the synthesis of new materials.  The
              researchers will then work to synthesize nano-particles of cross-linked ionomer
              polymers for application to soil remediation. 

The Cornell researchers
              provide expertise in polymer physical science and engineering, while the Korean
              strengths in industrial chemistry and materials science provide the tools of
              chemical synthesis needed for production of the novel materials to be
              investigated. The complementary expertise and facilities of the American and
              Korean laboratories promise synergistic advances in the research.
