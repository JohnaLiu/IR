The factors that affect growth and decline of populations in
              nature remain elusive, in part because the importance of social interactions
              has been underestimated.  The purpose of this study is to investigate joint
              nesting behavior in a salamander species and relate that behavior to changes in
              population size over time.  For example, populations that contain a high
              percentage of joint nesters may be larger in size than populations that contain
              a high percentage of solitary nesters.  In addition, whether nesting behavior
              is influenced by individual condition and whether populations differ in
              frequency of nesting behaviors will be studied.  Methods will include
              experiments in large laboratory terrariums and extensive field observations. 
              

Results from this project may indicate that existing predictive models of
              population growth and decline that treat all individuals as identical are
              inadequate and that the incorporation of individual behavioral variation among
              individuals into predictive population models may be a necessity.  Furthermore,
              data derived from this detailed population study may provide insights into
              possible causes of an alarming decline in amphibian populations in many areas
              of the world.  Active participation of undergraduate students in all aspects of
              this research will prepare them for research careers in the environmental
              sciences.
