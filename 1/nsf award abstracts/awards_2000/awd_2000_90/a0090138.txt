Abstract    :
              This award is concerned with a broad range of research in
gravitational
              physics. Some of the research deals with issues that have
arisen in attempts
              to formulate a quantum theory of gravity, such as
issues involved in the
              calculation of the "wavefunction of the universe".
Other projects involve
              investigation of the effects of strong
gravitational fields on the quantum
              properties of matter, such as the
extent to which certain positive energy
              properties continue to hold in the
presence of gravity. Yet other research
              projects concern the nature and
properties of classical gravitational fields
              in the theory of general
relativity. Some of the latter projects---such as the
              determination of
forces on bodies associated with their emission of
              gravitational
radiation---have direct implications for astrophysics and
              cosmology.

Although the proposed research includes a wide range of topics
              in
a number of different areas, there is a common theme to the main goals
              of
the research: To obtain a deeper understanding of the mathematical
              and
physical properties of the gravitational field as described by the
              theory
of general relativity, and to make progress toward the formulation
              and
development of a quantum theory of gravity. The development of a
              quantum
theory of gravity is currently at the forefront of fundamental
              research in
theoretical physics.
