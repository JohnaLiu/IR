Abstract    :
              A regional system of collaborative geoscience interpretation for the Finger
              Lakes region of New York State will be undertaken.  The Museum of the Earth
              (MOTE) will be the interpretive hub and partnerships with six Finger Lakes
              State Parks, Cornell University and the Paleontological Institute are in place
              to provide field sites and geology content information.

The integrated
              interpretive system of signage and related exhibits will be assessed as to
              reaching the needs of the target audience by way of extensive front end
              evaluation.  The development of the geoscience content and prototyping of the
              signage will continue throughout the planning period.
