Title:  Bringing Women and
              Minorities into the IT Workforce: The Role of Non-Traditional Educational
              Pathways

This CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests
              funds to study the role that non-traditional educational pathways play in the
              education of IT professionals, in particular, their role in preparing
              underrepresented minorities and women for IT careers.  The study will consist
              of four primary tasks.  The first task will be the collection of demographic
              data and statistical information to characterize non-traditional students and
              educational pathways.  The second task will be the collection of detailed
              information on the education and careers of non-traditional students in the
              Virginia-Maryland-D.C. region through surveys of former students and interviews
              with educators, employers, and employees.  The third task will be data
              analysis.  The final task will be a science policy conference to develop a
              policy agenda for federal and state governments based on the results of the
              first three tasks.  This project has the potential to provide valuable insights
              into the education of underrepresentation of women and minorities for IT
              careers.
