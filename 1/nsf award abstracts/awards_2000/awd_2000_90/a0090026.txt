Title:  Attracting and Retaining Women in
              Information Technology Programs: A Comparative Study of Three Programmatic
              Approaches

This CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal
              requests funds to examine the factors that cause women to select and remain in
              IT educational programs, in the context of three programs at the University of
              Colorado at Boulder.  One is the recently developed multidisciplinary
              Technology, Arts and Media (TAM) undergraduate certificate program that is
              attracting a very high percentage of women.  Another is the traditional
              undergraduate computer science major that is sparsely populated by women but
              taking steps to amend this situation.  The third is a Virtual Development
              Center supported by the Institute for Women and Technology that is specifically
              intended to involve women in formulating and conducting IT projects.  The
              overarching goal of this research is to gain knowledge that will lead to
              greater participation in and retention of women in higher education IT programs
              by identifying program features that appeal to women.  This project has the
              potential to provide valuable insights about the recruitment and retention of
              women in IT majors.
