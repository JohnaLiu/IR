Abstract    :
              The Arctic tundra on the Northslope of Alaska is increasingly impacted by human
              land use.  Areas around and within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge have
              been designated as part of the National Petroleum Reserve and may potentially
              experience oil exploration and development.  The ability of the tundra to
              recover from construction and disturbance will be investigated here.  Sites
              that were disturbed in the 1950s-1980s will be resampled to see how fast tundra
              vegetation recolonizes opened soil surfaces and to explore the mechanisms which
              promote recolonization.  These results would improve our understanding of the
              sensitivity of the tundra to human impacts.
