The PI proposes to use an advanced numerical code developed by
              the PI and her group to perform simulations of rheologically-complex two-fluid
              systems.  The code is based on the volume-of-fluid method for interface
              tracking with additional elements for solving the Navier-Stokes equations and
              for modeling the interfacial tension.  The code will be applied to investigate
              drop evolution in pipe flow, the evolution of bicomponent flows through
              channels, the flow of polymer dispersions, and the breakup of droplets.
              Collaboration with a number of experimental researchers both in this country
              and abroad is planned.
