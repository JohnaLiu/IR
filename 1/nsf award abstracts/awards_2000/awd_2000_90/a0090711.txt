It is now known that microbial species in culture poorly
              represent their natural diversity-which dwarfs conventions established for the
              visible world.  This was revealed over the last decade using newer molecular
              tools to explore environmental diversity and has sparked an explosive growth in
              microbial ecology and technologies that may profit from the bounty of natural
              biochemical diversity.  Several colloquia and meetings have helped formulate
              policy recommendations to enable sustained research programs in these
              areas.

The primary objective of the proposed workshop is to provide a forum
              to address science opportunities and research challenges recently made evident.
               How will we take genome sequence information back to the environment?  The
              environment is the context in which genomes evolved, function, and continue to
              evolve.  It is the only context in which they can be fully understood.  We
              suggest that we explicitly evaluate possible new roles of microbial
              systematics.  What role will microbial systematics play in providing order to
              the immense amount of genomic information now being generated?  How is genomic
              information packaged in the environment?  What is the relationship between
              genome sequence and phenotype?  What is comparative genomics telling us about
              the basic mechanisms of evolution and adaptive radiation?   These questions
              must be addressed before we can move forward in this field.
