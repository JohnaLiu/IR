Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for the development of a test bed, Advanced
              Diagnostic Vehicle Agent Network System(ADVANS) for automotive engineering
              fault diagnosis.  The ADVANS will be used to investigate the feasibility of an
              innovative engineering diagnostic model, Distributed Diagnostic AgentS(DDAS). 
              The proposed DDAS model consists of a number of signal diagnostic agents(SDA)
              and a device diagnostic agent(DDA).  A SDA is responsible for the fault
              diagnosis of one particular signal using either a single signal or multiple
              signals depending on the nature of the signal.  Each SDA will be developed
              using a common framework that incorporates technologies in signal segmentation,
              automatic signal feature selection, and machine learning.  Some of the agents
              contain information concerning the cause of faults for other agents, while
              other agents merely report symptoms.  Together these signal agents present to
              the device agent a full picture of the behavior of the machine currently under
              diagnosis.  The DDA applies case based reasoning techniques to the output of
              the SDA's to obtain the fault diagnosis of a machine.  The initial test bed,
              ADVANS, will consist of three SDA's implemented within the application area of
              automotive engineering diagnosis, EngineCoolantTemperature (ECT), Throttle
              Position (TP) and Engine RPM.  ADVANS will be used to study the following
              research issues related to the DDAS model: signal features meaningful for fault
              diagnosis, signal diagnosis at three levels of details, fuzzy learning from
              normal samples only, and feasibility of a distributed agent architecture for
              engineering fault diagnosis.

The results of this research will lead to a
              full investigation of the DDAS model.  The success of the fully developed DDAS
              model will provide a powerful and reliable engineering fault diagnostic
              technology to a broad range of US industries.  Speedy, reliable and cost
              effective product service will significantly increase the global
              competitiveness of the U.S. manufacturing and service industry.
