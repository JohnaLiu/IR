Abstract    :
              
This study will examine a leisure activity that appears to have all but faded
              from American culture, an agricultural encampment and fair in central
              Pennsylvania that has existed since 1873.  The project involves dissertation
              research by a student in the leisure studies department of Pennsylvania State
              university.  The project will describe and document the culture of the fair,
              and to understand why participants attending the fair chose to do so. 
              Thirty-six informants will be sampled from three age cohorts.  Data from
              participant observation and semi-structured, in-depth interviews using the
              Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique will be used to create a mental map of
              the fair for each informant. The new knowledge to be created will further our
              understanding of expressive culture and its significance to a rural American
              community.  In addition the research will contribute to the training of a young
              social scientist.
