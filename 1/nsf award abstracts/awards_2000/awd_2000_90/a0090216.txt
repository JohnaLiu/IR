Abstract    :
              
In order to fully understand how human-environment interactions have evolved
              we must learn how humans conceptualize environmental resources in the absence
              of western scientific technology. This project, involving the dissertation
              research of an anthropology student from the University of Georgia, will study
              how the Tzeltal Maya Indians of Chiapas, Mexico understand the healing actions
              of plants.  Folk models for the actions of 24 commonly used medicinal plants
              will be constructed during interviews with a range of Tzeltal-speaking
              informants.  A survey will then assess whether the folk models are shared by
              the general Tzeltal population.  The data generated by the research will be
              used to test hypotheses about human-environmental interactions, such as that
              the biological activities of compounds found in the plants will correlate with
              the folk models.  The student will provide local translations of her findings
              so the intellectual property rights of the Indians will be supported. The new
              knowledge to be created will be useful to health care workers as it will
              facilitate communication about health issues between local Mayan and Western
              biomedical practitioners. This research will add to our knowledge of
              naturally-evolved folk biological models, our socio-cultural knowledge of this
              important region of the world and as well as help train a young social
              scientist
