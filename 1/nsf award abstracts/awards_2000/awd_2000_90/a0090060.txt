Abstract    :
              The objective of the Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and
              Science (SOARS) program is to create a pipeline that brings academically
              talented African American, American Indian, Hispanic and Latino Americans, and
              women into careers in the atmospheric and related sciences, including
              engineering, mathematics, and social sciences.  The goal is to increase the
              number of students from these groups enrolled in a graduate programs in the
              atmospheric and related sciences, which will lead to an increase in their
              representation as scientists in the future workforce.
