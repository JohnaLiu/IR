Topoisomerases are ubiquitous, essential enzymes that pass
              DNA strands through each other to affect nearly every aspect of nucleic acid
              metabolism.   Topoisomerase IV has been shown by the P.I. and others to be
              required for segregation of daughter chromosomes and modulation of DNA
              supercoiling in E. coli.  The objectives of this project are to continue
              determining, using assays developed by the P.I., the roles and molecular
              mechanisms of DNA topoisomerases and to assess the consequences of unresolved
              topological structures in E. coli. Biochemical and genetic approaches with
              unknotting assays using site-specific recombination and topoisomerase
              inhibition allow us to test the hypotheses that topoisomerase IV unknots DNA
              and that persistent knots in the cell are lethal.  Specifically, the objectives
              of this project are: (1) To ascertain which topoisomerase unknots DNA in vivo;
              (2) To determine how topoisomerase IV distinguishes different topological
              forms; and (3) To assess the consequences of unresolved DNA knots.  E. coli is
              studied because it is well characterized with regard to topoisomerases, and
              biochemical and genetic analyses are straightforward with the genome sequence
              known. Results from the research will reveal how topoisomerases untangle rather
              than tangle DNA and how they distinguish problematic DNA knots or catenanes
              from beneficial DNA supercoils.
