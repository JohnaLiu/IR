This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics
              Program of the Office of Polar Programs, supports activities of the Antarctic
              Working Group for Geology and Geophysics during 2000-2001. This group affords a
              broad conduit for exchange of information between the Antarctic Geology and
              Geophysics program within the US Antarctic Program (USAP), and the diverse
              parts of the broadly-defined Antarctic earth science community. As such, it is
              a forum for discussion of the future goals of Antarctic geology and geophysics
              research, and the future needs of researchers for operational support through
              the USAP. More specifically, the Working Group brings to the program ideas
              about new scientific and technical opportunities, programmatic needs, and
              programmatic opportunities as perceived by the wider earth science community.
              The Working Group also provides an important mechanism for the flow of
              information from the program out to the community. The Working Group further
              serves to provide feedback to the program on logistical support questions
              relating to the USAP. In providing this function, the Working Group constitutes
              a useful management tool to help integrate science goals with operational
              portions of the USAP. The budget of this proposal primarily includes funds to
              cover travel costs for members of the Working Group and invited experts to
              attend a meeting at NSF headquarters. Funds are requested to cover salary and
              wages for development and maintenance of an improved web site to provide
              information to the Antarctic earth science community. The PI of this award will
              serve as Chair of the Working Group through August, 2001.
