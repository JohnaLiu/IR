Abstract    :
              The proposed request ito support participation in an Italian cruise to the Ross
              Sea, Antarctica in January-February, 2001.  The cruise invitation for this ship
              of opportunity was received in late spring, and hence was too late to request
              funding via normal funding venues.  It is a joint
              physical-biological-geological cruise that will sample a broad range of
              environments in the Ross Sea (e.g., the continental shelf break off Cape Adare,
              the Ross Sea ice shelf, the coastal waters near Terra Nova Bay, and the central
              Ross Sea).  The proposed research will focus on two scientific topics:
              aggregate formation and iron limitation of phytoplankton photosynthesis.  The
              process of aggregate formation and flux, a mediator in the flux of organic
              matter will be determined using a photographic technique.  The dependence of
              photosynthesis in a variety of environments will be assessed in the Ross Sea by
              a novel fluorometric method.  These near real-time estimates of
              photosynthesis/irradiance relationships are sensitive indicators of iron
              limitation.  This request is in response to a recent invitation to participate
              and provides a unique opportunity to sample the Ross Sea with novel techniques.
               The research opportunity made available builds on recent results from the
              southern Ocean and extends international collaborative efforts.  In the past,
              scientific coordination with Italian investigators in the Ross Sea has been
              spotty and somewhat tentative.  This collaboration (i.e., the offering of bunk
              space and scientific collaboration) is a big move forward in expanding the
              coordination of international activities.  This is also an opportunity to
              utilize the only ship available for scientific research in the Ross Sea in
              2000-01.  The data provided by the PI will employ two relatively new techniques
              to look at questions of iron limitation and aggregate formation.  The proposed
              work will provide the first opportunity to field test a novel and potentially
              ground-breaking instrument in the assessment of iron limitation and bring that
              expertise to the US Antarctic Program.
