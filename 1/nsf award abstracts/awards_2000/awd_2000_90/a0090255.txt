Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to recover fossil monkeys in middle Tertiary
              rocks in Argentina and Bolivia and to place known and new specimens within a
              more refined chronological framework. Recovery of older monkeys from South
              America (SA) will contribute important new information to the adaptations of
              early SA monkeys (also called platyrrhines). New material will shed light on
              how the relationship of species of monkeys from South America and African. 
              Also, new fossil remains will help to refine our understanding of the origins
              of the major kinds of platyrrhines, all of which trace back to a common
              ancestor thought to have lived about 20 million years ago.  Finally, new fossil
              primates may further constrain the time of entry of platyrrhines into South
              America.
The researchers will collect in three areas: 1) the 26
              million-year-old rocks of Bolivia which yield the oldest known South American
              primates; 2) a newly discovered 25 million-year-old locality in the southern
              Altiplano of Bolivia; 3) Patagonian sites dated at around 20 million years old
              that contain monkeys and other small mammals; and 4) earlier fossil sites in
              Patagonia and northern Argentina that preserve small mammals (but not monkeys,
              as yet) but had a favorable paleoclimate for the occurrence of monkeys and are
              presently inadequately explored.  Rock samples will be collected for 40Ar/39
              age determination.
