Jacoby


This is a proposal for a planning visit for Dr. Roxanne
              Jacoby to visit engineering schools in the Philippines, Thailand, China and
              Korea to develop collaborations between Cooper Union College and the
              engineering schools in these countries.  Cooper Union is outstanding in its
              engineering education programs.  This trip will provide a good opportunity for
              Dr. Jacoby to develop additional collaborations in engineering education with
              Asian schools.
