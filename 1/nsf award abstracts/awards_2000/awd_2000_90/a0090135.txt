Abstract    :
              Research Coordination Network: Biosphere-atmosphere stable isotope network
              (BASIN)

Stable isotope analyses play an important role in improving our
              understanding of the carbon cycle at both ecosystem and global scales. 
              Ecologists and atmospheric scientists have formed the Biosphere-Atmosphere
              Stable Isotope Network (BASIN), with several goals: development of common
              measurement approaches to allow cross-site data comparisons; development of
              integrated products such as global maps of variations in the isotopic
              composition of CO2 that can be used for better constraining predictions of
              global carbon cycle models; workshops to advance understanding and share
              knowledge; promotion and coordination of regional cross-site studies and
              web-accessed databases; and opportunities for cross-site training of both
              beginning and under-represented investigators in the latest methodologies and
              analytical approaches.  BASIN is part of an international effort (Global Change
              and Terrestrial Ecosystems, IGBP) to foster, promote, and encourage integration
              of stable isotope measurements into carbon cycle studies at ecosystem,
              regional, and global scales.
