This award supports Dr. Susan W. McRoy, Department of Computer
              Science, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, to conduct collaborative research
              with Dr. Yong Se Kim, Department of Mechanical Engineering, SungKyunKwan
              University, Korea.  The objective of the joint project is to develop an
              intelligent instructional software system for visual reasoning which can
              adaptively support different student learning needs, track students' progress,
              and give an active critique.  The intent is to provide a learning system with
              which a student can develop visualizing and spatial reasoning capabilities in a
              self-paced series of exercises related to solid modeling. 

The ability of an
              engineer to visualize and reason about geometric aspects of physical objects
              and processes is crucial to the success of the activities of the engineer.  The
              visual reasoning capability forms the essential foundation for engineering
              education in all disciplines.  This project will combine the complementary
              skills and expertise of the American and Korean researchers/educators/students
              to advance these educational tools.
