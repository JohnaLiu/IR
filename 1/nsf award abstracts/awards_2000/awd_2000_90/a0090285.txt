The 2001 IEEE AP-S/URSI Symposium on Antennas and
              Propagation, co-sponsored by the IEEE Antenna and Propagation Society and URSI,
              will be held from 8 to 13 July 2001 in Boston, MA, USA.  The purpose of this
              conference is to provide an opportunity for the exchange of ideas between
              academia and industry.  This purpose will be accomplished in two ways: by
              providing a firsthand look at the latest developments in the antenna industry
              and by providing a forum to discuss up-to-date problems and solutions in
              antennas and propagation in general.

The conference will feature oral
              presentations, poster sessions, exhibits, and workshops.  Approximately 1200
              papers are expected to be presented.  The exhibits will be provided by 20
              companies focused strictly on antennas and propagation.  Six to seven workshops
              and nine special sessions are currently planned.  The intention of the
              conference is to provide an international forum for the discussion of all
              aspects of antennas and propagation including novel antennas, propagation
              modeling and applications.  Topics to be considered will include (but are not
              limited to) the following:

.Adaptive, Active, Signal Processing & Imaging
              Antenna
.Biomedical Applications
.Broadband and Multifrequency Antennas
              
.Mobile and PCS Antennas
.Electromagnetic Education
.Application of
              Photonics in Antennas Systems 
.Microstrip Antennas
.Phased Array
              Antennas
.Numerical Methods for Analysis of Antennas
.Propagation

In
              addition, the following Commissions of the URSI will have sessions at the
              conference:

.Commission A Electromagnetic Metrology
.Commission B Fields
              and Waves
.Commission D Electronics and Photonics
.Commission F Wave
              Propagation and Remote Sensing
.Commission G Ionospheric Radio
              Propagation
.Commission H Waves in Plasmas
.Commission K Electromagnetics in
              Biology and Medicine
