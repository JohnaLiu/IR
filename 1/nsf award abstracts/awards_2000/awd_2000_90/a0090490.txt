It is proposed to
              operate jointly two diagnostic techniques to elucidate the property
              distribution of three-dimensional time-resolved granular flows.  These are
              Magnetic Resonance Imaging (for velocity) and x-ray tomography (for particle
              density, position and orientation).  So far, the MRI system available to the PI
              has yielded velocity fields with 100-micron resolution (i.e. 1/10-grain
              diameter).  On that basis, it is possible to reconstruct mass flow rates. 
              However, a full account (including particle spin, etc.)  requires the
              synergistic use of X-ray tomography, which is also available to the PI from the
              new Advanced Photon Source at the DOE Argonne Laboratory (550-nm resolution). 
              Special attention will be focussed on particle shape, contact interaction,
              ultrasmall ("nano") particle dynamics, and system evolution with time.

The
              outcome of this research should provide some understanding of the settling
              process, and of the role of volume exclusion in reaching a final
              non-equilibrium distribution ("jamming").  The contribution of shape anisotropy
              and of cluster formation to this less-than-optimum package of particles, will
              be tested against the proposed accurate experiments and the recently available
              theories.  Emphasis will be brought on three-dimensional geometry, oscillatory
              shear, particle interaction and mixtures (e.g. rod/spheres), ultrafine
              powders.
