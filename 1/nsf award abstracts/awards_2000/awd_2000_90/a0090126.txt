Abstract    :
              The project facilitates operation of a Science Management Office (SMO) for the
              Land-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions (LAII) component of the Arctic System Science
              (ARCSS) Program.  The SMO will facilitate planning and outreach activities that
              address LAII goals as described in a Science Plan written by the Science
              Steering Committee (SSC) and reviewed by the research community.  The award
              supports continued planning by the LAII SSC, maintenance of a web page for
              outreach to both the scientific community and the public, publication of
              planning documents, and organizing annual All-Hands meetings.  The SMO is an
              important activity to the planning and integration of interdisciplinary
              research projects addressing US Global Change Research Program goals in the
              Arctic.
