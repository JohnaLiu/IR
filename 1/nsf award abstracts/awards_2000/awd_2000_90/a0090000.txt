Attracting Women
              into the Information Technology Workforce through Technology Immersion

This
              CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to
              investigate IT immersion on the college major and career choices of young
              women.  The IT immersion program is modeled on the total immersion method of
              learning a foreign language.    In the IT immersion program at Saint Joseph's
              Academy, an all-girls Catholic high school, entering freshmen receive a laptop
              computer the summer before they enter the Academy.  They are required to take
              two weeks of summer school to learn to use their laptop and software that will
              be used in the classroom.  Information technology has been totally integrated
              into the curriculum, and teachers are evaluated on the degree of information
              technology integration  in their classes.  This research project will use a
              longitudinal case study approach including observation, interviews, and
              biannual surveys focussing on the current 9-11th grade young women at the
              Academy (using the IT immersion curriculum) and comparing them to the current
              12th grade and alumni from the Academy (using a similar curriculum without IT
              immersion).  The student using the IT immersion curriculum will also be
              compared to another private high school which does not use the IT immersion
              curriculum.  This project has the potential to provide valuable insights about
              factors that both motivate and discourage young women from choosing IT majors
              and careers.
