Abstract    :
              The researchers are working to develop general tools to diagnose
              end-to-end
performance problems of advanced network applications
              on
high-speed research networks.  This tool development will be grounded
in
              addressing the needs of two representative applications,
one with bulk
              throughput requirements and one with interactive
requirements.  The
              researchers capitalize on the existing Surveyor infrastructure and
will work
              with other NSF-funded projects (both applications and
measurement),
              coordinating closely with the Internet2 End-to-End
Performance Initiative to
              ensure the results continue to be
used past the expiration of this grant for
              problems facing
higher-education.
