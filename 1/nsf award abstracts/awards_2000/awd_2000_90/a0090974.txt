              Lay abstract

Daily, or circadian, rhythms of biochemistry, physiology and
              behavior are observed in a wide variety of organisms.  In mammals, the capacity
              to generate an endogenous circadian rhythm is dependent upon a discrete
              ensemble of neurons referred to as the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN).  The SCN,
              located deep within the brain, form a "biological clock" that is entrainable to
              external stimuli, such as light.  Over the past several years, advances at the
              molecular and genetic level have revealed that SCN rhythmicity results from
              autoregulatory feedback loops of so-called "clock genes".  Through as yet
              unidentified molecular events, these feedback loops couple to output pathways
              that in turn initiate circadian rhythms of physiology and behavior. 
              Importantly, external stimuli, such as light, are thought to entrain the
              circadian clock by resetting these loops. The main goal of this study is to
              determine the cellular signaling events that mediate rhythmic gene expression
              in the SCN.  Towards this end, mouse SCN tissue will be utilized to 1) identify
              intracellular signaling pathways activated by light, 2) determine how
              light-activated pathways affect rhythmic expression of core clock genes, and 3)
              determine how genetic feedback loops initiate events that drive output from the
              clock. 

An understanding of the molecular events that drive SCN rhythmicity
              should provide new insights into how circadian-controlled behaviors, such as
              the sleep-wake cycle, are regulated.  Furthermore, given the commonality of
              signaling events thought to mediate long-term adaptive changes in nervous
              system physiology, the data collected and approaches used in this study should
              be of relevance to neurobiologists examining a wide array of behavioral
              processes.
