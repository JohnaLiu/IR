A grant has been awarded to James R. Garey of the
              University of South Florida to support a symposium entitled "The 'Lesser Known'
              Protostome Taxa: Evolution, Development and Ecology".  The symposium is to be
              held on January 4, 2001 as part of the Society for Integrative and Comparative
              Biology (SICB) meeting in Chicago, IL.  The purpose of the symposium is to
              encourage the use and study of animal groups such as onychophorans,
              nematomorphs and kinorhynchs in research and teaching, and to showcase the
              importance of broad systematic study of animals.  The symposium is timely
              insofar as these lesser known phyla are becoming important in testing new
              hypotheses of animal phylogeny, studying the evolution of developmental
              patterning, and as important organisms in comparative genomics, physiology and
              ecology.  Results of the symposium will be published in the American Zoologist.
