Abstract    :
              In 1988 with support from the Division of Polar Programs and the Informal
              Science Education Program of the National Science Foundation, Sesame Workshop
              created Antarctica, a 20-page full-color booklet for students and teachers.
              This interdisciplinary resource, which was revised and expanded in 1996, was
              created for use in formal and informal settings in conjunction with a week of
              3-2-1 Contact programs about Antarctica. It includes information about
              Antarctica's geography, climate, plant and animal life, the scientists who work
              there, explorers, ongoing research, adaptation to the cold, and international
              cooperation. 

Both the National Science Foundation and Sesame Workshop have
              widely distributed the booklet at national and regional conferences of science
              and mathematics teachers, as well as at dozens of science workshops conducted
              by the Sesame Workshop School Services group, and the supply of these booklets
              has been seriously depleted.  Because the booklet continues to be popular and
              requests keep coming in, the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science
              Foundation requested that Sesame Workshop (formerly Children's Television
              Workshop) prepare a proposal to update and expand a four-color
              interdisciplinary booklet for eight-to-twelve year-olds about Antarctica and to
              create a simple website that supports the booklet.
