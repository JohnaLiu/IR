Abstract    :
              9733700  Barton    A major national science education goal is to promote
              scientific literacy for all Americans.  Egalitarian in theory, this idea of
              science for all has proven difficult to actualize among all students in all
              schools.  It has been documented that children living in urban poverty
              experience schooling as right: Teachers dominate classroom activity, students
              are passive, and learning is defined through rote memorization.  This kind of
              rigid education in science has resulted in students who view science as a set
              of facts to be memorized that has no connection or relevance to their personal
              lives.  It has also produced students who do not see or understand the
              interrelated nature of science and society, and who cannot use their skills and
              conceptual understandings to make personal decisions or to engage knowledgeably
              in debate abut scientific matters.  This is scientific matters.  This
              significant given that 20% of all children attend school in urban poverty.
