Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to implement a computational module designed to
              provide a mechanism for introducing ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling to the
              Geospace Global Circulation Model (GGC).  The PI will build on recent
              developments in implementing the TIMEGCM model
              (Thermosphere-ionosphere-mesophere electrodynamic general circulation model) on
              a workstation class computer as opposed to supercomputers.  The ionospheric
              coupling to the magnetosphere is a very important part of the GGCM.  As part of
              Phase 1 of the GGCM, the PI will run the TIMEGCM model with inputs from the MHD
              results for the selected set of conditions required by the GGCM steering
              committee for Phase 1.  The results will be made available to the space physics
              community WWW-based applications.
