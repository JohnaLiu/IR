               CAREER: A Systematic Approach to Reasoning about Actions and  Change    This
              is the first year funding of a three-year CAREER grant.  The proposed research
              is a step toward the systematic  construction of intelligent agents that can
              reason and act  in a changing world.  These "cognitive robots" should be  able,
              among other things, to (1) observe other objects  changing their attributes and
              performing actions, and (2)  use their observations and their knowledge to
              reason about  the future and the past, to make or revise plans to achieve 
              goals and execute the generated plans.  The approach here is  to develop (1) an
              action specification language that can  express actual and hypothetical
              situations, concurrent  actions, actions with complex effects, constraints, 
              triggers, mapping between actual situation line and actual  time line; (2)
              executable logic programs that embody the  specifications; (3) interpreters for
              extension of the logic  programs; and (4) the cognitive robots themselves.   
              During the period of the grant, an educational plan will be  developed that
              exposes students to the insights,  perspectives, and tools of AI by (1)
              educating  undergraduates about AI's basic methods and concepts and  about AI's
              philosophical, social, and cognitive  consequences, and (2) educating graduate
              students in other  fields about the AI techniques and tools applicable to their
               fields. Intelligent robots, which have a great attraction to  students and
              enable them to focus on some of the important  topics of AI, will be used in
              some of the courses to be  developed.
