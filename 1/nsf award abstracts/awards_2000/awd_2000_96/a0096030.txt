Works on this
              project concerns several analytic problems arising
from the area of geometric
              variational calculus. It contains
three parts. In the first part, we try to
              study problems related
to critical points (or bi-harmonic maps) for Hessian
              energy
functionals of maps between manifolds, such as partial regularity
for
              minimizing bi-harmonic maps, existence of bi-harmonic map
representations
              among homotopy classes from four dimensional
manifolds, and heat evolutions of
              bi-harmonic maps from four
dimensional domains.  In the second part, we try to
              develop
blow-up analysis for flows of stationary harmonic maps, flows
              of
Ginzburg-Landau systems, stable-stationary harmonic maps, and
energy
              concentrations and bubbling phenomena for entire solutions
to harmonic maps in
              three dimensional Euclidean space.  Here we
try to use geometric measure
              theory and PDE to understand the
defect measures associated with these
              objects.  In the last part,
the PI propose to study lower bound for p-energy
              and its
applications to possible dynamics of singularity for p-harmonic
map
              flows from two dimensional domains to the circle, as p tends
to two. We hope
              to build connections to vortex dynamics of
complex Ginzburg-Landau equations
              in two dimension.

Nonlinear partial differential equations are basic tools
              to
describe problems arising from both differential geometry and
physics.
              Harmonic maps model optimal objects with respect to
physically natural energy
              functionals in families of objects
satisfying common constraints. Heat flows
              of harmonic maps study
the long-time dynamical behavior of objects in such
              families. The
study will enhance our understanding of these maps,
              improve
methods to control the singular sets, and predict singular
behavior
              of solutions to these problems. Bi-harmonic maps are
natural in the study of
              both fourth order nonlinear PDE and
higher dimensional conformal geometry.
              Results here will have
potential applications to differential geometry,
              material science
including liquid crystals, elasticity/plasticity, and
              fluid
mechanics.
