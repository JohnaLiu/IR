The performance of the 2.2 meter Ritchy-Chretien
              wide field telescope of the University of Hawaii on Mauna Kea will be improved
              significantly by building and applying a broad-band optical system focal
              reducer to accurately match the field of view and the telescope resolution to
              the pixel sizes of a new 8Kx8K CCD focal plane. This new-capability instrument
              will enable searches for near-earth-objects, statistical studies of Kuiper belt
              objects, studies of the variability of young stars, searches for high red-shift
              supernovae.
