Abstract    :
              9800703  Garoufalidis       The investigator's recent and current research is on
              the notion  of finite type invariants of links and 3-manifolds.  The motivation
              for  the project comes from several sources: (i) perturbative Chern-Simons 
              theory, (ii) generalizing the notion of Vassiliev invariants of knots  in the
              3-sphere, (iii) separating the quantum group invariants of knots  and
              3-manifolds into elementary pieces and reassembling them.  One of the  goals of
              the theory of finite type invariants of knots and 3-manifolds  involves
              understanding the role and the strength of these invariants  in the
              classification of knots and 3-manifolds.       Thirteen years ago, Vaughan
              Jones discovered a simple yet remarkably  useful polynomial associated to every
              knot in 3-dimensional space.  Shortly afterwards, Edward Witten studied a
              3-dimensional gauge field  theory that generalized the Jones polynomial to
              knots in arbitrary  3-dimensional space.  Gauge theories in 3 and 4 dimensions
              are intimately  related to the high energy description of our physical world
              (in the  energies and the distances that we currently perceive).  In addition,
              knots  appear naturally as supercoiled forms of DNA (an important ingredient of
               life), as well as being trajectories of some elementary particles at high 
              energies.  Thus, the current research project has potential applications,  yet
              to be fully understood, in biology and in high energy physics.  ***
