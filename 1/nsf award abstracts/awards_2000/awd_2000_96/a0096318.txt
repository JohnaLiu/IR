Abstract    :
                          9801629  Morris      The project includes a simulation based Family
              Learning Program to be administered through the International Challenger
              Learning Center (CLC) network.  The goal is to develop families' skills in
              learning as a team through science, math and technology (SMT) in an environment
              where parents and children are co-travelers in a world of ideas.  PACCT is
              disseminated through ten of the Challenger Learning Centers reaching 22,000
              families nationwide.  Many of these activities are completed in the home at no
              cost to the anticipated 12,500 participating families.  Through this network of
              centers, all types of communities are served in many states.  The activities
              include Sim-U-Voyages, where family teams work at home; Sim-U-Challenges, where
              families create a physical model responding to a challenge; Sim-U-Visits, where
              families hear from scientists and work as scientists in a team solving a
              problem; and Sim-U-Ventures, which result in flying a mission.  Cost sharing is
              8%.
