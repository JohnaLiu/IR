Abstract    :
              The paleopalynological (pollen, spores, and aquatic microfauna) and
              paleobotanical (leaf, seeds, wood) collections at the Oklahoma Museum of
              Natural History constitute an important and irreplaceable scientific resource
              for the study of plant and animal systematics, paleoecology, evolution, and
              biogeography.  The collection was built through the efforts of one curator,
              Leonard R. Wilson, and his students between the 1930s and 1970s.  It currently
              comprises approximately 3800 bulk palynological samples plus ca. 50,000
              corresponding prepared microscope slides, and over 8000 macrofossil specimens
              from Oklahoma, the US mid-continent, and around the world.  In addition, there
              are over 2000 palynological slides, herbarium sheets, and wood samples of
              modern taxa from around the world that constitute comparative materials
              included in the overall collection.  Altough formal expansion and curation has
              been minimal since the mid- 1970's, the University of Oklahoma has renewed its
              commitment to the palynological and paleobotanical collections with the
              addition of staff.  The collections have  been assigned a larger area in a new
              building.  The current project will involve the acquisition of new cases for
              the collections and hiring temporary staff to move the collections.  Later
              activities wil include computerization of the specimen data.  The project
will
              significantly enhance the quality, and accessibility of these important
              collections for research, teaching, and public programs in the Museum.
