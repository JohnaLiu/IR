Abstract    :
              9622985  Ram    This award supports the research of Professor A. Ram to work on
              the connections between Lie algebras, quantum groups, Coxeter groups, their
              representations and combinatorics. In particular he will study representations
              of Iwahori-Hecke algebras and the centralizers algebras of tensor
              representations with special emphasis on the combinatorial aspects of these
              topics. For example, he hopes to obtain an explicit combinatorial formula that
              gives the irreducible representations as well as their irreducible characters. 
                This is research in algebra.  Algebra can be thought of as the study of
              symmetry in the abstract. As such, it has direct applications to areas of
              physics and chemistry. Much of algebra also connects directly to problems in
              coding theory and so has a direct bearing on the very practical problem of
              error correcting in data transfer.
