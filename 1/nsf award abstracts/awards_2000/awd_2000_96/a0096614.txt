Abstract    :
              The five-year Local Systemic Change project is part of a long-term, intensive,
              inquiry-based initiative that started in the district in 1997 with a pilot in
              two schools supported by state funds.  

"Renaissance in Science Education"
              (RISE) is a model program based on professional development and support for all
              372 K-12 science teachers in the district with nine elementary schools, two
              middle schools and one high school.  There are 351 teachers K-6, ten middle
              school and eleven high school teachers, respectively.  The instructional
              materials are mainly the Science and Technology for Children (STC) supplemented
              by  "old" ESS kits (now published by Delta) and the new STC/Middle School
              units.   At the high school level, teachers plan to examine and consider for
              adoption the latest secondary-level, exemplary, inquiry-based materials based
              on a plan for high school curriculum selection and implementation.  This
              selection will be carried out during the first three years with the
              professional development program for high school teachers being designed and
              offered in years four and five. 

Partners with the school district include: 
              Washington University, St. Louis; the Missouri Botanical Garden; the St. Louis
              Zoo and the St. Louis Science Center.
