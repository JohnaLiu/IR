Abstract    :
              9725601  Abers    This research will test hypotheses regarding the fate of 
              subducting slabs, by means of seismic methods to globally  characterize
              subducted crust.  At intermediate depths of 70-  300 km, subducting plates
              undergo a series of  transformations in both compositional and mechanical 
              properties.  The transformations play a critical role in  earthquake genesis,
              arc magmatism, plate densification, and  material recycling in the mantle. 
              Frequency-dependent  behavior, or dispersion, of regional seismic body waves is
               generated in slabs as they interact with subducted crust and  other
              interfaces, and so is a highly sensitive indicator of  the composition of
              subducted crust and surrounding mantle.  Previous observations show strong
              discrepancies in the mode  of dispersion of waves through the Tonga slab
              compared to  Japan and Alaska, suggesting remarkably different velocity 
              structures - high frequencies arrive early in Tonga, and  late in Japan and
              Alaska.  This research will characterize  that dispersion and how it varies
              globally between slabs.  ***
