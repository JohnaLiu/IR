Abstract    :
              This NSF grant will fund the PI's work in documenting and  analyzing the sound
              patterns of indigenous languages of Bolivia's  eastern lowland.  This region,
              also called Amazonia, is a rich  and ethnically diverse area where more than
              twenty-five distinct  indigenous groups engage in an ongoing struggle to
              preserve the  routine, every-day use of their ancestral languages.  To this 
              end, recent years have witnessed internationally-supported  efforts to develop
              bilingual education programs in Bolivia in  which children will be educated
              partly in Spanish (the  geographically dominant language) and partly in the
              traditional  indian language of their communities.  Leaders of such programs 
              have sought to involve North American and European linguists as  consultants in
              ongoing efforts to create linguistically informed  materials (such as,
              grammars, dictionaries, readers) that can be  used to educate children in
              indigenous languages.  In exchange  for our labor as consultants, the PI for
              this project and other  linguists are gaining the opportunity to study a
              variety of  indigenous languages for purposes that benefit the North American 
              scholarly community.  As most languages of eastern Bolivia are  understudied to
              date, the detailed information to be acquired as  part of this project is
              expected to contribute to linguists'  understanding of what human languages are
              like from a structural  point of view; the similarities and differences that
              exist  between languages spoken in diverse  regions of the world; and what this
              information might tell us  about the cognitive underpinnings of our linguistic
              systems.  The  PI's role in the ongoing research just described is tied to her 
              experience as a phonologist--a linguist who analyzes aspects of  sound
              structure in human languages, from the basic inventories of  consonants and
              vowels used, to the stress and intonation contours  imposed upon them in
              running speech.  The funds awarded by NSF  will be used to cover costs
              associated with travel to Bolivia for  stu dy and data acquisition; to purchase
              equipment needed to  analyze sound structures in these languages; to employ a
              graduate  student at the University of North Carolina to assist in this 
              analysis (a valuable aspect of that student's training); for  travel to
              scholarly conferences at which the results of this work  may be presented; and
              to assist in preparing work for publication  in scholarly journals and in
              magazines more accessible to the  general public, such as Science.
