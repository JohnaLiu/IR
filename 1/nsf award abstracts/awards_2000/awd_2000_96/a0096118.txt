Abstract    :
              This project will have two primary objectives: (1) to continue to extend the
              development and understanding of more advanced reinforcement learning schemes,
              which have demonstrated the ability to handle larger-scale problems and to
              mimic aspects of learning in the brain more than the conventional reinforcement
               learning schemes; (2) to apply advanced reinforcement learning to the
              development of more powerful intelligent agents for the Internet--and to use
              this application as a stimulus to the development of more powerful designs.  
              For example, existing search engines for the Web are an extremely  important
              class of agent, but also very limited in their capability because they tend to
              rely on simple string-mating techniques, occasionally supplemented by -and+ and
               -or+ operators and limited types of user-supplied clues.    This work will
              explore a novel approach to this problem,  based on a distributed system of
              intelligent  agents which focus on different domains but learn to understand
              each other, in effects.  If this approach is successful, it could have further
              implications well beyond the need for better search as such Ultimately it could
              contribute to the vision of converting the Internet itself into one large
              distributed intelligent  system.  This project will also include a substantial
              effort to apply these emerging  tools in education, and the development of new
              courses related to this work.
