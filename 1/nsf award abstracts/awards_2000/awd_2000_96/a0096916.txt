The PI proposes to
              develop a numerical model to accurately predict the downstream fining of
              sediment in low gradient, sand-bed rivers.   This phenomenon is very important
              in the understanding of river dynamics, long-term landscape evolution, and
              channel alteration.  This model will account for key physical mechanisms
              occurring in the sediment transport process.  Laboratory experimental results
              obtained at the University of Minnesota and at the Twente University will be
              used to validate the sediment transport models.  Overall results will be
              compared to field test data obtained from rivers in Papua New Guinea and
              Argentina.
