Abstract    :
              High resolution biological observations and samples have been collected
              approximately yearly over the nine year perod since the 1991 eruption near 9
              degrees 50 inutes north on the East Pacific Rise.  Continuous temperature
              records have been collected over the same time period from low-temperature
              diffuse flow sites and high temperature chimneys.  The biological time-series
              data will be analyzed to quantitatively and qualitatively characterize the
              temporal and spatial changes in vent community structure.  Multiple temperature
              records within individual difuse-flow sites will be analyzed and compared with
              those from all of the other diffuse-flow sites.
