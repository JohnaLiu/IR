Abstract    :
                Description: This award is for the support of cooperative research by Dr.
              Alice Smith, Department of Industrial Engineering at the University of
              Pittsburgh, and Dr. Berna Dengiz, Department of Industrial Engineering at Gazi
              University in Ankara, Turkey.  The project has two separate objectives: to use
              methods from computational intelligence, namely neural networks and genetic
              algorithms, to improve the design of data and voice communications network
              topologies when considering reliability; and to utilize the collaboration of
              the US and Turkish scientists (both are women) to study the issue of women
              participation in engineering in Turkey, and a comparison with their
              participation in engineering in the United States.  Scope:  This award allows
              cooperation of two scientists with complementary capabilities, to do important
              scientific work that has applications in the communications industry, in the US
              and in Turkey.  They will also address a subject that is important to careers
              of women in engineering in the United States.  The project will provide an
              international experience to one graduate student and one undergraduate student
              from the University of Pittsburgh, by conducting research at Gazi University in
              Ankara.  The project fits well within the objectives of the Division of
              International Programs.  This award includes funding from the Division of
              Engineering Education and Centers.
