This project involves the research and teaching of a young
              cultural anthropologist from Texas A&M university.  Under NSF's CAREER program,
              the researcher will define the history of transnational migration between the
              United States and Oaxaca, Mexico and describe the economic and social factors
              driving the rapid growth of transnational migration.  The role of remittance
              investment in the increase of socioeconomic inequality in the sending
              communities will be studied.  The methods used will consist of participant
              observation, formal survey questionnaires of 100 households in each village,
              and in-depth interviews in a sample of six villages in the Oaxaca valley. 
              Additional information will be obtained from local archives and museums.  The
              research will be combined with education by involving students in an innovative
              graduate and advanced undergraduate training program.  Bilingual Hispanic
              students will be recruited and mentored as they learn how to conduct
              ethnographic fieldwork from faculty drawn from both US and Mexican social
              science research institutions.  The total program will involve two years of
              course-work, one summer of field-work, and a thesis.  This project is important
              because it will advance our understanding of transnational migration and the
              impact of remittances on the most important sub-population in the US; it will
              educate and mentor young Hispanic students in advanced social science; and will
              support the career of a young researcher-educator.
