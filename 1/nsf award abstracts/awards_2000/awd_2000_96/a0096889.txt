Abstract    :
              The proposed studies are directed toward the development of transition metal
              catalyzed annulation methodologies for the synthesis of polysubstituted
              aromatics, heteroaromatics, and monomers for the preparation of conjugated
              polymers. Sequential cycloaddition/cyclization reactions, triggered by
              regiocontrolled palladium-catalyzed enyne-yne [4+2] benzannulation, afford
              condensed aromatic systems. Use of aza-enynes or aza-enynophiles similarly
              leads to pyridine derivatives. Various related synthetic routes to
              polysubstituted aromatic systems afford monomers for the synthesis of
              poly(phenyleneethylene)s and are applicable to the construction of a variety of
              classes of natural products.

With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program
              supports the studies of Professor Vladimir Gevorgyan, of the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Professor Gevorgyan is
              discovering and developing new techniques for the synthesis of cyclic and
              polycyclic organic molecules which represent the core structures of numerous
              biologically and pharmacologically active compounds. Simple precursors are
              efficiently converted to the desired target structures through spontaneous
              cascades of sequential reactions, affording unusual and adaptable new synthetic
              approaches. These synthetic routes are also applicable to the preparation of
              precursors for a class of polymers known to display significant electrical and
              optical properties.
