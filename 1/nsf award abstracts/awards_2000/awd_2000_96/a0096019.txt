Abstract    :
                Fox  9815469    Pitch pines, Pinus rigida, dominate or are important
              components of pine barrens and other forests covering over a million acres
              along the Atlantic coastal plain from Maine and Massachusetts to Maryland and
              the Appalachians. Approximately 100,000 acres of pitch pine dominated pine
              barrens exist and have protected status on Long Island, New York. Pitch pines,
              like many other pine species, have many adaptations to fire and require
              frequent fire both to regenerate and to retain their dominance in these plant
              communities.  A greater understanding of the forces shaping the growth and
              decline of pitch pine populations promises to offer more general insight into
              factors affecting the behavior of other disturbance- prone plant populations
              and communities.    While ecologists have understood for some time that natural
              populations and communities commonly never approach steady-state conditions,
              this study will help to develop practical tools needed to bridge the gulf
              between this conceptual understanding and the way we actually study and analyze
              natural populations.  Data on the survival, growth and fecundity of pitch pine
              seedlings and mature plants will be collected from sites in the Long Island
              pine barrens with known fire histories. The data will be analyzed using an 
              extension of mathematical demographic matrix models that we will develop,
              expanding upon the approaches used in previous studies of plant populations.
