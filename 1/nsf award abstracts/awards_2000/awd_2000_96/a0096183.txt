Abstract    :
                   A parametric finite element model will be introduced to analyze the
              deformation behavior of Cross Wedge Rolling (CWR) over a diverse range of
              operating conditions.  In conjunction with the numerical simulations, extensive
              experiments will be conducted using a CWR prototype machine to quantify the
              operating conditions that lead to part failure.  In addition, an experimental
              technique for determining the workpiece material flow and failure behavior will
              be developed.  From the combined experimental and numerical efforts, criteria
              will be established for predicting the three major failure mechanisms
              encountered during CWR:  (1) improperly formed workpiece cross section; (2)
              external defects on the surface of the workpiece (spiral grooves, overlapping,
              and necking);  and  (3) internal defects within the workpiece (porous voids and
              cracks).
     The  experimental and numerical work represents a significant
              advance to an emerging manufacturing process.
