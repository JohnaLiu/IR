              Title:                  Ultrafast laser produced microstructured plasmas for
              soft X-ray lasers    In this resrach, investigations into the generation of
              soft x-ray radiation form a laser solid interaction will be investigated.   An
              ultrafast laser pulse of intensity of 1016-1018 watts/cm2 is focused onto a
              solid, creating a highly nonequilibrium plasma.  The rapidly heated, rapidly
              cooled plasma formed from the laser-plasma interaction with the solid emits
              sub-picosecond x-rays.  The material itself can be patterned or
              "microstructured" for  the efficient absorption of the incident laser light and
              the emission of the x-ray radiation. The heating and cooling of the solid
              plasma can be tailored by the properties of the material(s) involved and by the
              microstructure e.g., high destiny grooves etc..  Key to the success of this
              work is the high intensity, short pulse laser for the initial heating.  Compact
              soft x-ray lasers will have many applications in biology and materials science.
