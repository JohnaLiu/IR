Abstract    :
              This project is on the development of modeling, simulation, and
              design
approaches for reducing device noise, substrate noise coupling, and
              supply
noise coupling in integrated digital/analog/RF ICs. Noise in
              analog/
digital/RF chips is being explored by understanding the contributions
              of
these three noise sources initially within the context of
              voltage
controlled oscillators (VCOs) and then in phase locked loops (PLLs).
              The
VCO is a good platform for this study since it presents one of the
              most
challenging aspects of RF and mixed-signal designs. Low phase noise
              VCO
designs are being investigated with a focus on (1) detailed
              parasitic
modeling of the tank circuit elements for RF applications, (2)
              inclusion of
noise due to the active elements, and (3) coupling noise from the
              substrate
and power supply. Simulation and design techniques are being
              developed to
predict and reduce these noise sources. The research in this
              proposal is
tightly integrated with a significant education component that
              includes the
development of new courses and dissemination of both the research
              related
results and the course material through the use of the world wide
              web.
