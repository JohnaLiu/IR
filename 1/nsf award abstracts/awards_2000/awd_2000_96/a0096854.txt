AST-0096854
Erickson, Neal

A fundamentally new kind of millimeter-wave
              receiver will be designed, built, tested and integrated onto the NRAO Greenbank
              telescope (GBT) of NSF and onto the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) being
              built by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The instrument
              will measure radiation from astronomical sources across the entire 75 to 110
              GHz window of clear atmospheric transmission with < 50 MHz of frequency
              resolution.  The unique technologies are 1. The development of monolithic
              integrated ultra-low noise amplifiers and wideband mixers, 2. Intermediate
              frequency amplifiers in the front end, 3. A wideband spectrometer backend.
