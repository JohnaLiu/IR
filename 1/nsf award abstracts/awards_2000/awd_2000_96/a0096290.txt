The objective of this proposal is to determine,
              characterize and model a new mechanism for solidification cracking observed in
              high purity iron-base alloys.  These alloys were thought to be immune to
              solidification cracking and their surprisingly poor cracking resistance defies
              current theory.  In this project ultra-low carbon iron alloys that contain
              systematic additions of Ni, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ti, B, and O are examined to determine
              their susceptibility to solidification cracking and the mechanism of cracking
              when it occurs.  The research plan combines modeling with experimental studies,
              including varestraint testing to measure the solidification cracking tendencies
              of the alloys and characterization of fracture surfaces by Auger spectroscopy. 
              Differential thermal analysis (DTA) establishes the length of the mushy zone in
              the selected alloys and the Gleeble and DTA determine the expansion/contraction
              effects of solid state phase transformations on weld shrinkage
              stresses.

It is important that "clean" iron-based alloys be resistant to
              solidification cracking since they represent the current trend in selection of
              high strength, high toughness structural alloys for applications in ships,
              bridges and buildings.
