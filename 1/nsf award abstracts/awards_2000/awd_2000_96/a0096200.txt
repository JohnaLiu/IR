Abstract    :
              9632406  Ansari  Fiber Optic sensors have the potential to provide true real- 
              time condition monitoring capabilities for construction  materials and bridges
              in the twenty-first century.  Optical  fiber sensors provide remote distributed
              measurement  capabilities which makes it possible to discern, in real-  time,
              the formation and progress of damage within various  sections of a structure. 
              The workshop will aid in  prioritizing and planning of a coordinated research
              program  in order to transfer this technology to the practice of  civil
              engineering.    Research activities are divided into six tasks including: 
              sensor characterization, transduction mechanism, sensor  embeddment and
              adhesion, sensor durability, condition  monitoring of bridges and standards,
              and specifications.  The workshop will be held during 1997 in Washington, D.
              C..  The final products of the workshop will be in the form of a  hard bound
              book detailing the state-of-the-art on fiber  optic sensor systems for
              construction materials, and a  comprehensive report outlining a detailed five
              year national  plan for research.  ***
