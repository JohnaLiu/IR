Abstract    :
              This grant will provide funding in support of a symposium to be presented at the
              annual Meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in
              Chicago on January 4-7, 2001.  The symposium is entitled "Integrative Aspects
              of Epithelial Structure and Function".  The symposium will feature great
              vertical diversity of experimental approaches, ranging from molecular analyses,
              through epithelial structure and function, to whole animal performance.
 
              
Epithelia, which consist of sheets of cells, serve vital functions in
              multi-cellular organisms.  Many epithelia (i.e. skin, gut, and the lining of
              blood vessels) serve a vital function as barriers.  These same barriers
              simultaneously play a crucial role in transporting important molecules into and
              out of the body.  The speakers will discuss recent findings regarding the
              functions of epithelia that relate to diseases such as cystic fibrosis, novel
              mechanisms of hormone function, and cellular protection against environmental
              stresses.  

The speaker list has been selected for its diversity.  It
              contains senior and well-established figures in the field, as well as new
              investigators who have not had numerous opportunities to present their work. 
              It includes tenured faulty as well as non-tenured faculty, graduate students
              and researchers.  The symposium is novel, therefore, both for the breadth with
              which epithelial structure and function are approached, and for the
              juxtaposition of senior established scientists and outstanding new researchers,
              in a comprehensive view of structure, mechanism and control in epithelia.
