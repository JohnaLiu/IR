Abstract    :
              9725057  Mayewski    This award is for support for a Science Management Office 
              (SMO) for the United States component of the International  Trans-Antarctic
              Scientific Expedition (US ITASE).  The broad  aim of US ITASE is to develop an
              understanding of the last  200 years of past West Antarctic climate and
              environmental  change.  ITASE is a multidisciplinary program that  integrates
              remote sensing, meteorology, ice coring, surface  glaciology and geophysics.  
              In addition to the formation of  a science management office, this award
              supports a series of  annual workshops to coordinate the science projects that 
              will be involved in ITASE and the logistics base needed to  undertake
              ground-based sampling in West Antarctica.
