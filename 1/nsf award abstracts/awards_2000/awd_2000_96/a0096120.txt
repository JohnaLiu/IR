Abstract    :
              9450251  Geary    This geoscience project proposes to develop and disseminate an
              integrated, interactive multimedia, computer-based curriulum for middle school
              earth science students (grades 5-8).  The program would enable students to
              explore real data for developing and testing hypotheses.  Problems are posed by
              the curriculum and lesson sequences center on solving a specific earth science
              problem with designed software tools.  A constructivists learning model is
              used.  Students prepare their own workbooks in this project and evaluate their
              progress.  The GET-IT lessonware would serve both as instruction software and
              as a research tool.
