Abstract    :
              Professor Ingrid Fritsch of the University of Arkansas is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program for her research on electrochemistry
              in ultrasmall volumes and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) microfluidics.  The
              research on ultrasmall volumes will attempt to determine the smallest sample
              size and lowest concentration that can be amperometrically analyzed and how
              interactions with microfluidics affect such analyses.  The effects of proximity
              of adjacent electrodes and of redox cycling from adjacent electrodes will be
              examined.  Chemical modification of surfaces adjacent to electrodes will be
              evaluated with respect to immobilization chemistry and electrochemical
              detection will be studied in separate but closely spaced scenarios.  The second
              thrust will determine the strengths and weaknesses of MHD for microfluidic
              applications.  MHD microfluidics will be driven with an external magnet. 
              On-chip suitability of MHD will be evaluated, and a demonstration system of an
              immunoassay test system utilizing MHD microfluidics will be constructed.

As
              devices are miniaturized and analytical tests are demanded on chip platforms,
              the question of how to deliver fluids in tiny volumes becomes a challenge. 
              Studies on ultrasmall volumes are complicated by evaporation and solution
              manipulation.  Implementation of microfluidics methods and development of new
              ones are immediately needed for microanalysis.
