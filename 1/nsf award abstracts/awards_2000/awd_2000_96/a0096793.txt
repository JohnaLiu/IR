Description:  This award supports a US-India cooperative
              research project on Molecular Diversity of Actinorhizal Symbionts Found in the
              Sikkim Region of the Eastern Himalayas.  US PI David Myrold, Oregon State
              University and Indian co-PI Arvind Misra, North Eastern Hill University,
              Shillong will study the molecular diversity of Frankia that nodulate several
              actinorhizal plants in the eastern Himalayas.  This research extends previous
              studies on the molecular diversity of Frankia, an important N2 -fixing bacteria
              genus, to include strains from the montane region of India.  The objectives are
              to: 1) assess the molecular diversity of Frankia as a function of host plant
              and geographical location, and 2) use sequence information to add to the
              current phylogenetic tree of Frankia.               

Scope:  This work
              builds on the joint expertise of the PIs in using molecular methods to study
              Frankia.  Research results will complement studies done in North America and
              Oceania, which have yielded differing results regarding the relative importance
              of host plant species or environmental factors as determinants of Frankia
              diversity.  Practically, this research may prove useful in attempts to use
              actinorhizal plants in revegetation and restoration efforts, as they are
              important early colonizers of disturbed sites. This award is jointly supported
              by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Environmental
              Biology.
