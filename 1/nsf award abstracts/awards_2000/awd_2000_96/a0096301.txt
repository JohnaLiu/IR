Abstract    :
              Larsen  9701410    This award funds the research of Professor Michael Larsen,
              who will investigate two problems in algebraic number theory.  The first is a
              project undertaken jointly with Richard Pink to analyze in a qualitative sense
              the full image of a compatible system of Galois representations. The underlying
              classical problem, finding the Galois group of the points of finite order on an
              abelian variety, goes back at least to Kronecker in  special cases but remains
              unsolved in general.  The second project is more narrowly focused and concerns
              the search for a generalization to n-dimensional varieties of Hasse's
              reciprocity law for central simple algebras over number fields.     This
              research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number
              Theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing
              such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by
              another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for
              many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half
              century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas
              such as data transmission and processing, and  communication systems.
