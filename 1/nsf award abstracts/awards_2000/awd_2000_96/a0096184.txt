Abstract    :
               Due primarily to the complex interaction of metal cutting which combines high
              strain rate deformations with friction, there still exists no adequate model of
              metal cutting.  In this Career proposal, an innovative finite element model
              will be introduced to investigate, under a diverse range of operating
              conditions, the following: (1) three-dimensional explicit dynamic effects, (2)
              velocity-temperature dependent friction, (3) cutting tool coating, and (4)
              cutting tool chip-groove geometry.  The results obtained from the finite
              element simulations will provide innovative knowledge in several areas which
              are vital for obtaining high quality and productivity in machining. 
              Experiments will be performed to validate the model.  The education strategy
              will incorporate moderate changes in teaching approach and introduce the
              following:  (1) the development of an engineering software course, (2) the
              incorporation of numerical solution techniques into several core mechanical
              engineering courses, and (3) the utilization of computer based solution
              techniques in a capstone team design project.   The success of metal cutting
              and other machining processes requires a complete knowledge of the tribological
              behavior involved.  Substantially new and usable information can be gained from
              this study about the influence of coating thickness and materials on machining
              performance.  Finite element results on grooved cutting tools will provide
              guidance for obtaining desired chip-breaker characteristics.  The education
              plan will better prepare engineers that are team oriented, with computer based
              problem solving skills which are adaptable over time.
