Abstract    :
              This project begins to fill a puzzling gap in the scientific literature
              by
undertaking a comparative study of wealth accumulation patterns of
              black
and of white households, as can be learned from the manuscript schedules
              of
population for 1850 and 1860. To better identify undercurrent of
              movement
and their possible explanations, a longitudinal dataset is being
              compiled
that links samples of Mid-Atlantic households recorded in the US
              census
manuscript schedules. Modern statistical methods will be used to
              estimate
models of socioeconomic differences in wealth ownership and
              wealth
mobility. The research findings will be valuable to: (1) economists
              who
seek to understand historical aspects of wealth inequality; (2)
              social
scientists analyzing the relationship between socioeconomic differences
              and
social outcomes; and (3) policy makers who want to address
              socioeconomic
differences in wealth accumulation patterns.
