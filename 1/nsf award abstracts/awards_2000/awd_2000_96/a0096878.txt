Abstract    :
              This research is focused on quantifying the role of light intensity and organic
              complexation on rainwater iron speciation.  Preliminary data indicate that
              there is both seasonal and diurnal variability in iron speciation.  The results
              of this research are relevant to atmospheric processes that affect the
              oxidative capacity of the atmosphere and to the lifetime and bioavailability of
              iron as a nutrient and its influences on marine primary productivity.
