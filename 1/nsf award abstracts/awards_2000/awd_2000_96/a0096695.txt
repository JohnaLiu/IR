Abstract    :
              	The proposed research explores the broader comparative relevance of the
              literature on economic voting by moving outside of the North Atlantic basin to
              focus on newer democracies and less stable economic contexts.  Drawing on both
              individual- and aggregate-level data, the research tests hypotheses about
              economic voting at the national and sub-national levels of government in three
              major countries of Latin America.  The central working hypothesis is that
              voters in Latin America are sensitive to macroeconomic fluctuations and punish
              or reward governments accordingly, but that the propensity toward economic
              voting varies with macroeconomic context and institutional conditions.  The
              several components of the proposed research project are designed to contribute
              to theoretical work on economic voting, enhance our understanding of the
              functioning of democracy at both the national and sub-national level in
              contemporary Latin America, and establish a stronger theoretical basis for
              understanding the ways in which variations in the structure of party
              competition and macroeconomic volatility condition political behavior.
