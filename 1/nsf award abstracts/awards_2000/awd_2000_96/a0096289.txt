49-PET-408 (On Your
              Knees Cave) is one of the most significant archaeological sites yet discovered
              along the Northwest Coast of North America.  The site contains the oldest human
              skeletal material known from Alaska or Canada and the first discovery of human
              skeletal remains associated with early Holocene microblade traditions in North
              America.  A two and a half year research project is proposed to excavate and
              analyze the archaeological remains at 49-PET-408 to evaluate the theory that
              the earliest human migration to North America may have occurred with the use of
              watercraft along the southern margin of Beringia and then southward along the
              Northwest Coast.  The research will build upon and strengthen the cooperation,
              understanding, and mutual respect among scientists, Alaska Natives, and Federal
              agencies.
