Abstract    :
              9357383  Daly    It is necessary to understand the physical processes occurring
              in  distant galaxies and clusters of galaxies to constrain or determine  the
              cosmological that describes our universe.  The plethora of new  data on high
              redshift galaxies and clusters of galaxies will be  used to determine the
              physical properties of these systems.  The  masses, ages, and evolutionary
              stages of the systems will be  estimated.  The results of the studies will be
              used to explore the  use of these systems to constrain or determine the
              cosmological  world model applicable to our universe.
