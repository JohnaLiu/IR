A large data set consisting of acoustic and optical
              measurements of suspended particulate matter is available from two west coast
              estuaries, as well as extensive ancillary data.  Techniques will be developed
              to invert the acoustic and optical data to sediment size class spectra.  These
              will then be combined with the ancillary environmental data to study the
              processes responsible for the distribution of suspended sediment in the two
              estuaries and, in particular, the development and variability of the estuarine
              turbidity maximum, a region of enhanced suspended sediment concentration. 
              Finally, a comprehensive theory of the dynamics of estuarine turbidity maxima
              will be developed and compared to the results of the previous analyses. 
              Estuarine suspended sediment transport, in general, and the dynamics of the
              turbidity maximum, in particular, are important for the management of pollutant
              transport, navigation, and living marine resources in estuaries.  The analyses
              and syntheses proposed will focus our conceptual understanding of these
              processes in a broad class of estuaries.
