This award supports theoretical and computational
              research and education centered on strongly correlated electron materials with
              the aim of working toward realistic calculations based on dynamical mean field
              theory. Dynamical mean field theory methods will be further developed. Planned
              advances include: the incorporation of material specific realistic orbital and
              crystal structure, and developing extensions of the theory to include
              short-ranged correlations.  Experimental work on V2O3, NiSe2-xSex mixtures,
              cerium- and ytterbium-based heavy fermion materials, and strongly correlated
              organic compounds provides motivation for this theoretical investigation.

This award supports theoretical and computational research and education
              centered on materials where strong electronic correlations play an important
              role.  The proposed work would develop new many-body techniques and
              computational algorithms to extend and overcome some of the limitations of the
              dynamical mean field theory.  The dynamical mean field theory has enjoyed
              success in capturing essential features of the Mott transition which is driven
              by strong electronic correlations. The proposed work would focus on more
              accurate and realistic descriptions of materials including V2O3, NiSe2-xSex
              mixtures, cerium- and ytterbium-based heavy fermion materials, and strongly
              correlated organic compounds.
