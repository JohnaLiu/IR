Abstract    :
              Anomalies in the oxygen isotope compositions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
              molecular oxygen (O2), which are the basis for new probes of gross carbon
              exchanges between the atmosphere, biosphere, and oceans, will be investigated.
              These anomalies are the results of stratospheric reactions involving O2, ozone
              (O3), oxygen atoms, and CO2. The rates for O3 formation from the reaction O+O2
              are different for different isotopic species. The resulting anomaly in O3 is
              then photochemically transferred to CO2, although other reactions to be studied
              might also contribute. Anomalies in CO2 are accompanied by corresponding
              anomalies in O2 (from which the O3 formed). This isotopic signature is
              destroyed only by respiration/photosynthesis processes at the Earth's surface.
              Once the stratospheric anomalies are better quantified, the isotopic
              composition of O2 in the troposphere can therefore be used to infer globally
              averaged marine and terrestrial biosphere productivity. Ice-core records of the
              O2 isotopic composition can then be used to derive the biospheric productivity
              and its response to environmental change for the past 400,000 years. This will
              lead to a better understanding of Earth's climate history, and therefore,
              future.

In this project, stratospheric air samples will be analyzed for the
              isotopic composition of CO2 using isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Coupled with
              laboratory experiments and modeling, these measurements will provide new
              observation-based constraints on the mechanisms that lead to the observed
              compositions and on the fluxes of stratospheric CO2 and O2 to the troposphere.
              This information is needed to interpret the O2 record.
