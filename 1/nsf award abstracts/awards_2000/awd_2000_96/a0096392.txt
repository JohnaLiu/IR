Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research program are to use Rydberg atoms as a novel tool
              to study non-linear dynamics in impulsively driven systems, to investigate the
              control and manipulation of atomic wavefunctions, to probe ultra-low-energy
              electron/molecule scattering, and to examine the behavior of atoms near a solid
              surface.
