Abstract    :
              The Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT) is charged with the care of two
              large and very important orphaned herbaria: the Lloyd H. Shinners Collection in
              Systematic Botany, formerly housed at Southern Methodist University, and the
              Vanderbilt University Collection.  Although a young institution, BRIT has grown
              significantly, and a new facility to house it will be constructed by 2007. 
              This facility will allow for expanding programs in education, allow for
              increase of library holdings, enhance the conduction of taxonomic research, and
              expand space for editorial offices for BRIT's scholarly publications. 
              Currently an additional 4000 square feet of space are being leased to house the
              Vanderbilt collection and ease crowding for the other collections.  The current
              project will allow for the purchase of 400 additional herbarium cases for this
              space for the Vanderbilt collection, which will eventually be housed in the new
              facility.
