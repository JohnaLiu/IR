Abstract    :
              0096551/O'Donnell

Primarily observational in nature, this project is a study
              of the 
structure of the velocity and density fields along the frontal
              boundary 
of a freshwater river plume, together with measurements of mixing at
              the 
base of the plume during the reversal of the tide.   The data from
              
observations at the edge of the plume will be used to test the validity 
of
              predictions extrapolated from laboratory results, and to improve the
              
parameterization of lateral mixing in a numerical model of a freshwater
              
plume.  Estimates of mixing across the base of the plume will be derived
              
from a study of the salt budget in a 100,000 square meter box, together
              
with microstructure profiles within the box.   These estimates will be 
used
              to test the hypothesis that small river plumes are mixed away 
vertically,
              shortly after the turn of the tide, as a result of the build 
up of strong
              vertical shear at the base of the plume.
