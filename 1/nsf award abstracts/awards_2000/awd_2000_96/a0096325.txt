Abstract    :
              9801726  Mikhalkin       Mikhalkin will analyze how algebraic characteristics
              determine  topological properties of real algebraic varieties.  The subject was
               pioneered by Harnack and Hilbert over a hundred years ago; the  introduction
              of modern topological techniques to the subject by Arnold  and Rokhlin resulted
              in substantial development of this theory in  dimensions 1 and 2 over the past
              3 decades.  The investigator  will continue the study in these dimensions; of
              special interest here  are curves which arise as visible contours of surfaces. 
              He will also  consider the case of dimension 3 in connection with the recent
              work of  Kollar introducing the Minimal Model Program into the subject.      
              In Optics, Mechanics and Robotics, most configuration spaces appear  with
              natural real algebraic structures; e.g., the configuration space  of any
              mechanical linkage arises as the intersection of quadratic  hypersurfaces.  The
              visible contours of surfaces appear in computer  vision problems.  ***
