Abstract    :
              Phelps  9800126    Open star clusters are unique laboratories for investigating
              a wide range of fundamental problems in astrophysics, yet only a small fraction
              of the ~1200 cataloged open clusters have ever been observed photographically
              or photoelectrically, let alone with state-of-the-art charge coupled device
              (CCD) detectors.  The potential wealth of knowledge obtainable from open
              clusters, therefore, remains largely untapped.  For the first time in history
              it is possible technologically to observe the majority of the known population
              of open clusters.  Research conducted under this NSF award represents the first
              step toward providing the first comprehensive, systematic determination of
              fundamental parameters(e.g. reddening, distances, and ages) for the majority of
              the known open clusters in the Milky Way.
