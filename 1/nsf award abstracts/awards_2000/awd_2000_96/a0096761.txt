Abstract    :
              This award supports the continuation of measurements of high-resolution
              temperature-dependent photoabsorption cross sections of N2 and O2 in the
              spectral regions near strong dayglow emissions of N+ and O+ as well as a major
              spectroscopic band system of N2 near 100 nm.  The range of temperatures that
              would be explored in these measurements is from room temperature to ~900 K. 
              Also included in the award is support for the measurements of
              temperature-dependent fluorescence cross sections for the production of N and
              N+, O and O+ emissions through photodissociative excitation and dissociative
              photoionization excitation of N2 and O2, respectively.  The cross section
              measurements would be obtained at the Japanese Photon Factory, and the
              fluorescence measurements would be obtained with a new position-sensitive
              detector at the Advanced Light Source facility at the Lawrence Berkeley
              Laboratory.  These laboratory results are important for the improved modeling
              of the dayglow emission production and solar radiation transmissions through
              planetary atmospheres.
