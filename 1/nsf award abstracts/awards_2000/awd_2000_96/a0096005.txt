This proposal focuses on the development and modification of
              numerical techniques for simulating the discrete mechanics of granular shear
              zones using the distinct element method (DEM).  The goal of the research is to
              study frictional processes within these shear zones using simple, physical
              experiments to calibrate the numerical methods.  Recent experiments conducted
              by Dr. J. Gollub at Haverford College reveal many characteristics of geologic
              shear zones: stick-slip sliding behavior that stabilizes with increasing
              sliding velocity, precorsory deformation events within the assemblage, and a
              hysteretic time-dependence of friction on velocity attributed to dilation
              effects in the assemblage.  The P.I. proposes to try to reproduce the results
              of Gollub's experiments using DEM simulations, and in so doing calibrate
              numerical implementations of specific contact laws such as force damping and
              interparticle friction.  In particular, she will explore the use of rate-state
              friction laws for implementing sliding friction at particle surfaces, which may
              explain some of the complexity associated with gouge-filled shear zones.  In
              turn DEM simulations will be used to highlight some of the deformational
              features that Gollub has observed, shedding further light on the slip and
              localization phenomena that develop in granular materials.
