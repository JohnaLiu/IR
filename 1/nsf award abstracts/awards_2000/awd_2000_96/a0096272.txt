              Abstract  ATM-9631282  Overpeck, Jonathan T.  University of Colorado  Title:
              Climate Change of the Last 500  Years: Simulations Versus  Data    This award
              will support the scientific coordination needed to  complete a 500-site global
              database of annually-dated time  paleoclimate time series, and document it
              sufficiently for broad  usage by the entire global change community.  This
              database will be  used to map the spatio-temporal patterns of climatic
              variation over  the past 500 years, and thus provide the first comprehensive
              view  of pre-anthropogenic interannual to interdecadal climate  variability. 
              The project will coordinate the use of data and  theory to produce new timwe
              series of hypothesized volcanic, solar,  trace-gas, tropospheric aerosol,
              land-use, thermohaline and ENSO  climate forcing over the past 400 years. 
              These time series of  forcing will then be used as input to a suite of
              transient climate  model experiments using state-of-the-art 3-D atmospheric and
               coupled atmosphere-ocean models developed at NASA GISS.  The  simulated
              responses to the various hypothesized forcing will be  compared to the
              spatio-temporal patterns of change mapped out using  the database.  This will
              make significant reductions in the  uncertainty regarding the nature and causes
              (natural and  anthropogenic) of interannual to century-scale climate
              variability.
