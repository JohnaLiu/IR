Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for the PIs to collect two bathymetric transects of sediment
              cores on the southern Florida margin and the western margin of the Great Bahama
              Bank.  The PIs will also reconstruct the history of the flow for the Florida
              Current through the Straits since the last glacial maximum on millennial to
              centennial time scales through the Holocene and last deglaciation based on
              these and existing cores.  The work will further our understanding of
              circulation changes in the Florida Current system and therefore the heat
              transport to high northern latitudes.
