Abstract    :
              *** 9871226  There is growing recognition of the special "window on the past" 
              afforded by paleo-climatological studies, notably those developed from  high
              resolution, continuous, well-dated, multivariate ice core  records.  The
              Climate Change Research Center (CCRC), Institute for the  Study of Earth,
              Oceans and Space at the University of New Hampshire,  has been a leader in the
              siting, recovery and chemical analysis and  interpretation of aerosol, snow and
              ice core samples from the Arctic,  Antarctic and Asia.  As a con- sequence of
              such research, investigation into  changes in climate and in the chemistry of
              the atmosphere is expanding both  nationally and internationally.  The
              scientific issues  posed require continued creativity, research on local to
              global scales and the  translation of resultant scientific concepts through
              academic curriculum and  public outreach.  This Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI) project will allow  CCRC to address the foregoing by:  (1) broadening
              CCRC's global research  capability through upgrades to its mainst  ay research
              tool, ion chromatography, leading to improved laboratory efficiency, 
              replace-ment of current outdated instruments and new educational opportunities;
               (2) broadening CCRC's research and educational activities through acquisition
              of  aerosol and precipita- tion sampling equipment in support of its local to 
              regional scale, New England based  , monitoring program; and (3) complementing
              CCRC's existing global glaciochemical  sampling capability by improving its
              existing continuous sampling equipment.  ***
