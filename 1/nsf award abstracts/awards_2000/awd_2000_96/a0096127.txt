Abstract    :
              9522815  Tsao   Recent advances in tool materials and spindle technology have
              the potential to dramatically increase material removal rates.  To achieve this
              requires high dynamic rigidity and precise motion and speed control to maintain
              accuracy.  Direct drive technology eliminates the gear reduction between servo
              and the tool or spindle motion. Potentially this means high performance, but it
              also eliminates the means by which the servo and the final motion can be
              decoupled.  This means that to achieve the potential of direct drives in
              machining systems, the drive dynamics have to be included in the dynamic model
              of the system.  This research will complete the theoretical design of an inner
              loop robust feedback control, outer loop repetitive control and control 
              tracking control, and optimal feedforward/preview control.  Dynamic mechanistic
              models of the machining process represent the loads presented to a direct drive
              machining system during operation.  Two experiments to test these direct drive
              control concepts are part of the research: two axes high feed rate milling, and
              variable spindle speed machining for chatter suppression.  These results will
              provide fundamental understanding of the dynamics and control of direct drive
              machining that can be used to design the next generation of high performance
              direct drive machining systems.  ***
