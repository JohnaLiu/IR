Abstract    :
               Humans and other animals use visual 'looming' of a stimulus to detect change in
              distance of a stimulus in the depth of the visual field.  It is unclear how
              such visual cues drive neural signals that guide appropriate behavioral
              responses such as approach or avoidance for such a stimulus.  This project uses
              an insect, the moth Manduca, which hovers in front of flowers while feeding in
              flight, as a simpler system for experimentation.  A combined approach links
              behavioral experiments to physiology and to modeling, to experimentally test
              alternative hypotheses about which visual cues are relevant for guiding
              behavior, as a basis for developing computational models with realistic
              biological parameters.
   Results will be important beyond insect vision, for
              understanding depth detection and obstacle avoidance by visual mechanisms in
              general, and for developing useful machine vision and guidance systems in
              robotics.  This project also provides excellent cross-disciplinary training of
              a postdoctoral woman neuroethologist in an exceptionally strong environment for
              computational neuroscience.
