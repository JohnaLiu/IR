              Enhancement:  Analysis of Specialized Constraint Models for Engineering Design 
               

This work is a departure from the past PI's research effort and an attempt
              to diversify into specific problem-areas in Computer Science and Engineering
              where immediate practical relevance and hard-core experimental verification are
              the bottom line.  The work encompasses two pilot exploratory research projects.
               The first project concentrates on key, missing technology for decomposition of
              geometric constraint systems into small, compact subsystems whose solutions can
              be recombined.  The second project involves development of a comprehensive
              noncooperative resource allocation model and analysis, specifically for
              designing QoS provision architectures in best-effort environments, with
              particular emphasis on bridging the gap from theory to realizability.  In both
              projects, rigorous analyses will be performed and small, prototype
              implementations developed.
