Abstract    :
              This project is to establish an international center for research on giga-scale
              system-on-a-chip (SOC) designs. It involves researchers from U.S., Taiwan, and
              China. The center is being supported by the National Science Council (NSC) in
              Taiwan and the Chinese National Science Foundation (CNSF) to support the
              activities by researchers from Taiwan and China respectively.
Focus of the
              project is on innovative design methodologies, tools, and algorithms that
              enable efficient giga-scale SOC integration in nanometer technologies. Research
              activities include investigation and development of efficient SOC synthesis
              tools and methodologies, SOC verification, test, and diagnostic technologies,
              and an SOC design driver that motivates and validates various synthesis,
              verification, and test techniques developed during the course of this research
              project. The design driver is a SOC design of a network processor, which
              includes embedded CPUs, DPSs, FPGAs, and various kinds of memory components.
              The research on SOC synthesis tools and methodologies includes design
              specification, design partitioning, synthesis and optimization for embedded
              DPSs and FPGAs, physical synthesis for full-chip assembly, and synthesis
              techniques for design re-use. The research on verification and test focuses
              functional verification, self-test using on-chip programmable logic, analog and
              mixed-signal self-test, and test for embedded memories.
