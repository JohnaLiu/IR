Abstract    :
              Recent work has indicated that dunite bodies in ophiolites, and presumably also
              in layered ocean crust, represent melt transport conduits through which
              basaltic melt has migrated and interacted chemically. In this proposal,
              Lundstrom proposes to test two aspects of this general hypothesis. First, he
              proposes to test the hypothesis that the melts that moved through the dunites
              are in fact very enriched and produced by melting of mafic heterogenieties in
              the mantle. He proposes to do this by measuring the isotopic compositions of
              oxygen and lithium in mantle spinels from ophiolite samples and mantle
              xenoliths. A second test, using samples from the Trinity ophiolite, is to
              determine whether there exist gradients in lithium and other incompatible
              element isotopes as a function of distance from dunite bodies.
