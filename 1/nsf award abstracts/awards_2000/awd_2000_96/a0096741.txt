UnISIS is a laser guided adaptive optics
              system located at the Coude focus of the Mount Wilson 2.5-m Telescope.  It is
              unique in providing a test-bed for Rayleigh laser guide star work in
              astronomical adaptive optics.  A three-year program has been defined to bring
              UnISIS through the Science Commissioning phase and to make some of the first
              deep-sky astronomical observations with a laser guided adaptive optics system. 
              These science observations will be the highest priority aspect of this research
              work.  In addition, the performance of UnISIS will be analyzed by comparing
              theoretical simulations (including atmospheric turbulence) with on-the-sky
              observations.  This analysis should reveal the relative importance of factors
              such as (1) the deformable mirror fitting error, (2) focal anisoplanatism (i.e.
              laser guide star cone effect), (3) temporal sampling errors, and (4)
              signal-to-noise dependent errors at the wave front sensor.  Both the science
              observations and the system performance analysis should have general
              application to other adaptive optics systems because the atmosphere above Mt.
              Wilson Observatory provides some of the best observing conditions in the
              world.

This work will support a postdoctoral student through the NSF Center
              for Adaptive Optics.
