Abstract    :
              The 1600-km-long North Anatolian transform fault across northern Turkey has been
              repturing from east to west in a series of large earthquakes during the past 60
              years.  The rupture front advanced 160 km westward in 1999 in two disastrous
              earthquakes.  The next rupture is expected to occur within the next few decades
              benearth the Marmara Sea.  In October 2000, the shelf and adjacent slope of the
              northeastern Marmara Sea were charted using multibeam bathymetry and
              backscatter technology.  The goal was to resolve the planview geometry of
              seismogenic fault strands, and to identify any related features such as
              mass-wasting deposits, sand blows, mud volcanoes, and degassing craters.
