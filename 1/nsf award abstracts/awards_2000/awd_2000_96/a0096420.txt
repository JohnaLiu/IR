Abstract    :
              
This action provides support for four U.S. researchers to participate in, and
              contribute to, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) workshop, to be
              held 8-11 October 2000 in Beijing, China.  They are scheduled to give keynote
              addresses and invited lectures, and will form the backbone of the U.S.
              representation at this important workshop.  The U.S. participants will
              contribute several articles on the workshop to U.S. technical publications in
              construction (Engineering News Record), civil engineering (Civil Engineering
              Magazine), and the oil and gas industry (Offshore Magazine).
The workshop
              addresses best practices in the assessment and management of aging offshore oil
              and gas platforms and floating production facilities - a major environmental
              risk in the APEC Region that has over 1,000 offshore oil and gas structures. 
              The workshop promotes private sector and public sector partnership by bringing
              together a mix of experts from oil and gas regulators, academia, consultants,
              oil and gas companies, and certification bodies.  The goals of the workshop
              include strengthening intra-regional cooperation among APEC economies, and
              contributing to the quality of coastal waters by helping APEC oil and gas
              producers to identify facilities that are no longer structurally sound.  The
              end product of the workshop will be publication of a recommendation paper,
              distribution of papers presented at the workshop, and continued development of
              an APEC directory of specialists on this topic
