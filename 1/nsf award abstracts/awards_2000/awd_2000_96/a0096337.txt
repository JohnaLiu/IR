Abstract    :
              	The proposed study will examine the relationship between the depth of
              implementation of the mathematics standards in high school classrooms and the
              cognitive capacity of the local implementers.  Cognitive capacity is defined as
              depth of knowledge and beliefs in the organization about reforms and strategic
              use of knowledge and beliefs to obtain important organizational resources that
              teachers and others in the system need to fully implement standards. 
              Qualitative and quantitative measures will be used to collect data in a
              comparative case study design of 17-20 school districts in Colorado.
