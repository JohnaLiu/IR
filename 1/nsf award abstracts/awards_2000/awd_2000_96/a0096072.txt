Abstract    :
              The application of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) has been driven by the rapid 
              growth of digital computing power and the need for fast, reliable computer 
              processing techniques for communication, biomedical, manufacturing, seismic, 
              radar, and a wide variety of other signals for commercial and scientific 
              interest.  Despite the great success of traditional DSP techniques, many real- 
              world problems remain unsolved due to the nonlinearities and non-Gaussian
              noises  often encountered in these applications.  Solving these more complex
              problems  requires the development of new, more flexible, nonlinear DSP theory
              and tools.   The objectives of this project are to develop these new tools and
              theory, and to  transfer them directly into practice and into the engineering
              classroom.    A new framework for nonlinear DSP based on the wavelet transform
              is currently  under study.  The desirable properties of the wavelet transform,
              such as time-  frequency localization and signal compression, are being
              exploited to develop  sophisticated, yet tractable, nonlinear processing
              techniques.  Key elements of  the work include the development of statistical
              re-sampling methods and data-  adaptive wavelet analyses for nonlinear DSP. 
              Applications of the new framework  to cross-disciplinary problems in imaging
              and communications are being  investigated.  The principal investigator is
              concurrently developing innovative  approaches to engineering education
              including Internet-based tutorials and  documentation of new research,
              cross-disciplinary student design projects, and  tools for curriculum
              assessment.
