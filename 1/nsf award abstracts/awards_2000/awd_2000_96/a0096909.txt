Abstract    :
              Summary:  This study is will obtain data on oxygen isotope, deuterium/hydrogen
              and chloride values in pore waters from deep sea sediments to reconstruct the
              temperature, salinity, and oxygen isotope composition of deep ocean waters
              during the last glacial maximum.  The measurements will allow construction of
              vertical density gradients of the glacial ocean and allow a test of the concept
              that deep water production was controlled by sea ice during glacial intervals
              and that the relationship between isotopic composition of sea water and
              salinity observed in the modern ocean may not hold for the last glacial
              maximum.
