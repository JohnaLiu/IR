Abstract    :
              A commercially available Aerosol Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (ATOFMS) will
              be used to measure the composition of particles that have been preclassified
              according to various physical properties. These measurements will provide new
              insights into the physical/chemical properties and mixing characteristics of
              atmospheric particles. Such information is valuable for interpreting data from
              more conventional instrumentation and can be used to evaluate state-of-the-art
              models that describe the evolution of aerosols from various sources as a
              function of size and composition. Particles will be classified according to
              electrical mobility (size) with a differential mobility analyzer (DMA), size
              and hygroscopicity with a tandem differential mobility analyzer (TDMA), or size
              with a DMA or TDMA and mass with an Aerosol Particle Mass Analyzer (APM). The
              effect of volatilization on composition will be studied by heating
              size-classified particles before analyzing them with the ATOFMS.

The first
              two years of the project will focus on studies with laboratory aerosols of
              known composition and on the development of sampling protocols for field
              measurements. An intensive field campaign will be carried out in Atlanta, GA.
              This project represents a collaboration between the University of Minnesota and
              Carleton College.
