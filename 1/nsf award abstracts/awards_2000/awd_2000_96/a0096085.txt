Abstract    :
              This proposed work is a study of how satellite data can be used to improve our
              understanding of how antarctic cloud characteristics affect the exchange of
              radiation and the surface energy budget of the antarctic ice sheet.  Current
              general circulation models (GCMs) of the atmosphere are notoriously poor at
              incorporating the effects of clouds in polar latitudes, and cannot reproduce
              valid surface temperatures and winds.  The reason for this lies in the fact
              that the ice surface and cloud tops look very much the same in the visible
              spectrum, and the surface temperatures and cloud top temperatures are not
              sufficiently different to produce identifiable differences in the infra-red
              spectrum.   Without careful consideration of these confounding effects, models
              that represent antarctic climate processes affecting the mass balance of the
              antarctic ice sheet have a very limited verisimilitude.
	
This study will be
              concerned with three tasks: (1) construct a climatology of cloud amount,
              height, temperature, phase (ice vs. water), optical depth, and effective
              particle radius; (2) conduct sensitivity studies of cloud, atmospheric, and
              surface properties on the surface energy budget, and (3) generate an improved
              surface energy budget by combining satellite data, GCM analyses, and a regional
              climate model.

Even though the uncertainties in some components may be
              large, the energy budget resulting from this high degree of data assimilation
              and integration is expected to be more accurate than anything else currently
              available on the large scale.
