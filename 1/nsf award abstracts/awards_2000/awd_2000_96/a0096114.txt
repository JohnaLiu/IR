Abstract    :
              Zehr  95-03593      The  primary productivity of the oceans is intertwined  with
               the   biogeochemical  cycling  of  nutrients  required   for  autotrophic 
              growth.  Although there is not clear  agreement  on  which nutrients limits
              ocean productivity, it is evident  that the major nutrients nitrogen (N) and
              phosphorus (P) are  present  at  low  concentrations in the  oligotrophic 
              ocean  gyres.   The  argument  for  N limitation  has  always  been 
              complicated  by  the  fact  that  N  deficiency   could   be  alleviated  by 
              the biological reduction of atmospheric  N2.  Yet  few  N2  fixing organisms
              have been found in  the  open  ocean.     The  development of DNA amplification
               and  probe  techniques for characterizing N fixation genes are  powerful 
              tools   for   assessing  N2  fixation   potential   in   the  environment.  
              Recent advances have demonstrated  that  this  approach  can be used to assay
              the expression of N2 fixation  genes,  which  will be developed further  as 
              part  of  this  program.   The  goals of this research will be to  complete, 
              substantiate  and extend the conclusions from prior  studies  of  N  fixation 
              in  the context of physical,  chemical  and  biological  parameters of the
              Atlantic and  Pacific  Oceans.  This research will answer the question of the
              presence of N2  fixing  species in the oceanic environment and  the  factors 
              limiting  the  distribution and expression  of  N2  fixation  genes.
