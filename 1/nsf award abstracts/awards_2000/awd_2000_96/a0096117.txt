Abstract    :
               Development of a cost-effective production finishing process is pivotal for
              commercial success of structural precision ceramic components.  High-speed
              grinding of ceramics has emerged as a viable potential candidate for such
              finishing operation.  However, unlike metals, ceramics are brittle and highly
              sensitive to process induced surface and sub-surface damages in the finished
              part.  Process damage may be minimized by maintaining force/abrasive grit below
              a critical threshold.  This, however, imposes an extremely small material
              removal rate that is an order of magnitude lower than that required for
              commercial viability.  Current efforts focus on improving material removal rate
              under these constraints.  This research project seeks to explore new design
              avenues, particularly for very high-speed grinding, above the current critical
              thresholds of depth of cut and feed/grit.  The objectives of the research are:
              (1) to establish and experimentally validate a mechanistic model of material
              removal and associated damage evolution in high-speed machining; (2) to use the
              validated model to investigate the roles of two new design parameters: 
              impulse/grit and intermittent unloading; and (3) to implement and investigate
              new design states in existing surface grinding facilities.     The project will
              establish the potential of new design avenues for precision ceramic grinding
              that may deliver very high material removal rate while minimizing residual
              damage in the finished part.  This can have significant impact on the
              efficiency and effectiveness of finished brittle materials including structural
              ceramic parts and optical components, as well as processing of silicon wafers
              for electronic applications.
