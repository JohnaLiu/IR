Abstract    :
              9720653  Pruitt  Alabama's strategy to improve its R&D competitiveness is based
              on a  detailed analysis of Alabama' s economy, industrial enterprises, and 
              research and technology base. The strategy is to strengthen  infrastructure in
              information science and technology, materials  science, and biological and
              environmental science.  Specific projects  for which NSF support is requested
              are:  (1) Infrastructure to support  Alabama and regional connections to
              Internet 2, which will provide  Alabama university researchers with high
              performance Internet  connections to National and regional networks; (2)
              integrated research  environment for intermeshed optoelectronics, which will
              develop an  integrated research environment to study systems in which optical
              and   electronic elements are intermeshed in close physical proximity; (3) 
              Infrastructure in sensor technologies for public safety which will  develop
              sensitive, miniature, "smart" detectors for identifying  contaminants in food
              supplies, for detecting the presence of  explosives in cargo and luggage, and
              for monitoring of roadways for  hazardous conditions; (4) laser and photonics
              research infrastructure,  which will develop new optical imaging techniques for
              biomedical  applications; (5) infrastructure support for the Biomedical Implant
               Center, which will support recruitment of additional faculty and  students and
              purchase of sophisticated instrumentation for improving  the compatibility of
              medical implant devices; and (6) infrastructure  enhancement for marine
              sciences, which will support the recruitment of  experts in sedimentology and
              ecological modeling to strengthen  research in marine sciences. Each of these
              proposed activities have  carefully developed management plans and strategies
              to obtain  financial support beyond the period of EPSCoR funding.
