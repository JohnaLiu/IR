Fully lithographed bolometer arrays using
              Voltage Biased Superconducting Bolometer (VSB) technology will be used to
              explore planar band-defining filters and RF multiplexers for use with
              antenna-coupled bolometers and to fabricate and test prototype arrays of
              antenna coupled hot-electron bolometers with RF multiplexers and filters, and
              fabricate and test 32 x 32 absorber-coupled focal-plane bolometer arrays.  Also
              work to explore integrating these arrays with a recently developed readout
              multiplexer that uses only a single SQUID per row of detectors will continue.
              

This technology will provide new high sensitivity detectors in the
              currently unexplored but astrophysically interesting sub-millimeter part of the
              electromagnetic spectrum.
