Abstract    :
              Ahmed H. Zewail of the California Institute of Technology is supported by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies on femtosecond
              dynamics of intramolecular vibrational relaxation (IVR) and reactivity in
              complex systems.  During this period he will focus on the following areas:  a)
              experimental and theoretical studies of complex systems; b) studies under
              complex solvation:  gas vs. liquid; and c) transition states and IVR:  control
              of reactivity.  Techniques to be used include picosecond and femtosecond lasers
              in conjunction with molecular beam machines equipped with time-of-flight mass
              spectrometry; photoelectron and laser-induced fluorescence chambers.  In
              addition, the condensed phase studies will exploit transient absorption and
              fluorescence up-conversion techniques. 

In addition to the education of
              graduate students and post-doctoral coworkers, this work has fundamental
              significance that is likely to translate into applications.  Understanding the
              chemistry of complex systems lays the ground-work for attempts to make better
              materials and alter complex biological chemistry.
