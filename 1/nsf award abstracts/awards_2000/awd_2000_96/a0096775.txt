Advanced Technology Optical Spectrograph for
              the 
Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR)

A multi-purpose
              imaging spectrometer is planned for the Southern Astrophysical Research
              Telescope at Cerro Pachon, Chile. Some features are 1. All refracting
              instrument operating from 320 to 850 nm; 2. Five arc-minute by five arc-minute
              field of view with 0.146 arcsecond per pixel sampling; 3. Spectral resolution
              between 900 and 9,000; 4. Maximum spectral resolution of 14,000; 5. Image
              quality degradation of less than 0.13 arc-seconds at the field corners and 6.
              Spectroscopic transmittance of 65%. A full and very comprehensive observing
              program in stellar astrophysics, galactic astronomy and extra-galactic
              astronomy are scheduled. This project is co-funded from a private foundation:
              the Goodman Foundation.
