The goal of this research is to better understand the
              energetics and dynamics that lead to the formation of inorganic nitrates. A
              series of inorganic nitrates will be studied using variable temperature
              solid-state NMR spectroscopy and variable temperature diffraction measurements.
              The atomic positions and electrostatic interactions will be characterized.
              These measurements will then be correlated with the measurement of the motion
              of the nitrate ion, from NMR spectroscopy, and will be used to develop an
              atomic-level model that is consistent with the temperature dependent behavior.
              With this model, a greater understanding of the relationship between dynamics
              and electrostatic interactions in inorganic nitrates will be obtained. This
              work will also lead to a better understanding of the formation of ionic
              materials that contain polyatomic ions.

This project initiates a
              collaboration between investigators from the United States, South Korea, and
              Australia that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The
              United States group will provide the solid state NMR measurements, the South
              Korean group will provide the neutron diffraction measurements, and the
              Australian group will provide the single crystal X-ray diffraction
              measurements. This collaboration has the potential to be long term and to
              provide fundamental understanding of many important solid state inorganic
              materials.
