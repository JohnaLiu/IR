Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to support graduate students and young
researchers to
              attend the conference Statistical Challenges in Modern
Astronomy III, to be
              held from July 18-21, 2001, at the Penssylvania
State University, University
              Park, PA. The primary focus of this
cross-disciplinary conference is on
              applying advanced statistical
techniques for the analysis of observational
              data in astronomy. One of
the topics of the conference will be statistical
              methods for extremely
large data sets and information systems. Another topic
              is statistical
aspects of dealing with data resulting from the current
              revolution in
observational cosmology. The organizing committee and speakers
              represent
both communities and cross-disciplinary discussion is encouraged.
