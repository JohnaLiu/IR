Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop a long-term perspective on climate variability in
              the North American tropics using tree-ring records from the highest mountains
              in Mexico and Central America. The following questions will be addressed: (1)
              what is the tree-ring record of climate change in tropical North America?; (2)
              is ENSO or decadal-scale modulation represented in treeline growth?; (3) can
              the major modes of variability in the North American monsoon be retrieved from
              dendrochronological records?; (4) are tropical and/or extratropical volcanic
              eruptions reflected in high-elevation tree-ring features? Intensive monitoring
              of daily weather and tree growth will be performed at about 3600 m elevation on
              Nevado de Colima, Mexico, to quantify growing season length and dendroclimatic
              relationships. Several timberline sites will be sampled in central and southern
              Mexico, and exploratory field trips will be made to the highest mountains of
              Central America. The resulting network of tree-ring chronologies will be
              calibrated against instrumental and historical records to reconstruct
              large-scale features of climate.
