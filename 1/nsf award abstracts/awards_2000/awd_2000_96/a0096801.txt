Abstract    :
              This Doctoral Dissertation Research Investigation analyzes the dynamics of
              fundraising between incumbents and challengers on a daily basis over an entire
              election cycle. The principal objective is to estimate momentum effects in
              incumbents' and challengers' fundraising. Just as in presidential elections,
              the expectation exists that potential contributors in congressional races make
              their allocation decisions in terms of bandwagon effects and expectations about
              who will win. A candidate's expectations of success depend not only on the
              amount of cash on hand, but also on the rate at which new money is being
              accumulated. Hence, the rate at which candidates raise money-the operational
              definition of momentum in this investigation--is a theoretically important
              factor in understanding congressional election outcomes as well as the
              interplay between incumbents and challengers over the course of the
              campaign.

This Doctoral Dissertation Research Investigation promises to
              enhance our understanding of this important topic.
