              ABSTRACT

OCE-0096460

Sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in
              the ocean by nutrient additions as well as  direct deep ocean injection of CO2
              remains an active and controversial area of scientific  discussion and
              research.  Multiple scientific experiments have successfully demonstrated the
              efficacy of  short-term, small scale iron additions to spur phytoplankton
              growth. At least four  industries are now studying the feasibility of larger
              scale commercial operations  ostensibly to increase fish production and
              potential carbon trading programs in the future.  Presently there are no
              scientific or legal protocols to provide oversight to these operations  and
              guidance for the public to assess these commercial scientific ventures.

With
              support from this grant, the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography
              (ASLO) will convene a two-day workshop in the Spring of 2001 to define  the
              scientific and legal uncertainties surrounding C sequestration in the ocean.
              The  proceedings from the workshop will be published in a peer- journal. In 
              addition, the workshop will help form the issues and rationale for a larger
              symposium on  ocean carbon sequestration at some future time.

ASLO is well
              suited to conduct this workshop. The Society conducted one of the  first
              scientific symposia on Fe limitation of primary production in the ocean and the
               proceedings were published in a special issue of Limnology and Oceanography,
              the societal journal, in 1992.  In addition, the Council of Environmental
              Challenges at MIT (an alliance of  academic and industry scientists) will
              co-host the workshop and provide logistical  support. The final agenda,
              however, will be determined by an independent steering  committee.
