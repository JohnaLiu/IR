Abstract    :
              A broad program of research in atomic, molecular, and optical physics and
              related areas will be carried out at JILA at the University of Colorado.  Three
              major themes, or focus areas, characterize the effort:  ultracold atoms and
              molecules, including behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates, formation of
              degenerate Fermi gases, and atom guiding; ultrafast optical science and
              applications, including coherent control of molecules, quantum information, and
              probing molecular bonds and dynamics; and novel tools and spectroscopy,
              including innovative molecular spectroscopic techniques and metrology with
              femtosecond sources.
