Multimedia applications such as Digital Library,
              Video-On-Demand, Electronic Commerce, and World-Wide-Web have been developing
              at a very fast rate.  The main objective of this four-year CAREER project is to
              design a generic high-quality video-based storage system.  The goals are (1) to
              search for efficient processing algorithms for the static video file allocation
              problem, (2) to develop the theoretical framework for dynamic video file
              allocation problem, (2) to develop the theoretical framework for dynamic video
              file reallocation and (3) to investigate efficient software design for emerging
              serial storage interfaces.  A video-based storage system (i.e., middleware
              solution) with guaranteed application quality over high-speed communication
              networks is designed.  The research includes both theoretical performance
              evaluation and measurement through an experimental system.  The integration of
              research and education is achieved by developing a series of multimedia system
              design courses and a research laboratory to provide students a facility to
              design, implement, and test the proposed high-performance video-based storage
              system over high-sped LANs.
