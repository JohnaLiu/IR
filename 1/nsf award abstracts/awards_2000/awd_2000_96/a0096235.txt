              Abstract    Gibson  9710214    This research extends the PI's previous research
              on the process of democratization in South Africa.  The current project is a
              second wave panel study of 3,0331 persons who were interviewed in 1996.  The
              second wave will explore further respondents political intolerance, and changes
              that are occurring in how South Africans are becoming committed to democratic
              institutions and processes over the course of the early period of
              democratization, the role institutional change plays in creating more
              democratic attitudes, values and behaviors, the effect of efforts to induce
              tolerance through persuasive communication, and the roles cognitive
              mobilization and civil society play in creating more democratic attitudes and
              values.  Great care is being taken to minimize the loss of respondents in the
              second wave of the design, to be sure that respondents can answer in their
              language of choice, to be certain the questions and experimental scenarios used
              in the interviews are equivalent across languages, that respondents represent
              the racial and linguistic heterogeneity of the population, and that reliability
              estimates for the instruments are calculable.  The sophistication of the
              surveys in this project fill a void that previous survey work in Africa has
              left because of the questionable methods employed.  The project extends
              theoretical developments in our understanding of the process of democratization
              as well as provides an invaluable dataset that will be available to other
              researchers at the conclusion of the project.      %%%    This research extends
