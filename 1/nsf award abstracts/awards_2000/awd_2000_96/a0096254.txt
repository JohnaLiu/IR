This award is made as a part of the FY98 CAREER
              competition.  The scientific component of the research focuses on the study of
              dust-particle transport in plasmas.  The techniques of particle image
              velocimetry will be used to follow the motion of the particles.  This marks the
              first time that this technique, which to date has been used on fluid systems,
              will be used to study dusty plasmas.  The final years of the work will
              concentrate on the analysis of "crystals" in the plasma.  The educational
              component of the activity involves the development of a competitive program
              that brings a high school student/teacher pair to work on a project in the PI's
              laboratory during each summer.  This project would then be taken back to the
              high school during the subsequent academic year.  At the same time the PI will
              serve as "science mentor" for the teacher's class during the school
              year.
