Abstract    :
              This proposal is for the development of an internet-based professional
              development model that would supplement hands-on workshops.  The model would
              promote conceptual change and would be broadly accessible to elementary
              teachers.  The efficacy of the model would be tested through an evaluation
              process.  The focus is on using "everyday stuff" to teach children about the
              designed world.  The project features collaboration of engineers and teachers
              in the development of curriculum.  The project focuses on five topics of design
              that have previously been the basis of prior NSF-supported curriculum
              development by the PI, namely:  "Environmental Analysis and Design;"
              "Mechanisms;" "Circuits and Controls;" "Packaging and Structures" and "Signs,
              Symbols and Codes."  The project includes a pilot phase that focuses on
              facilitator training in the conduct of online forums for teachers, at five
              professional development sites.  Two hands-on workshops will be conducted at
              these sites.  A field-test phase follows, involving scaling-up to 15 sites
              nationally.  The primary deliverable is a tested professaional development
              package.
