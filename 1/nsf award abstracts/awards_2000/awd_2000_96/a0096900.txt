The Sloan Digital Sky Survey project is a major
              inter-agency and private-foundation partnership funded ground-based effort to
              map 10,000 square degrees of the sky at a spatial resolution of 0.40 arcseconds
              in the spectral bands at: 0.35, 0.48, 0.62, 0.76 and  0.91 micrometer
              wavelengths with an SNR of 10 for 22.3 stellar magnitudes at 0.62 micrometers
              wavelengths.  The survey goals are to record 900,000 field galaxies down to red
              magnitudes of 17.7.  Further details of this ambitious survey are given at: 
              http://www.astro.princeton.edu/PBOOK/intro/intro.htm    .   Three aspects of
              the project will be supported in whole or in part over a five-year period.
              These are Observing Systems (salaries and maintenance), Data Processing and
              Distribution, including data distribution and data base user support, and
              salaries for observers and telescope/instrument specialists.   Continuation of
              the observing program to acquire scientific data and the preparation of that
              data to enable general access by the broad astronomical community are the
              primary thrusts of this effort.
