Abstract    :
               This research investigates issues associated with analysis,  testing and
              maintenance of procedural and object-oriented  programs, with  emphasis on the
              problems presented by C and  C++.  Several issues of particular  concern are
              program  representation, integration testing, selective regression  testing and
              testing of object-oriented programs.  A program  representation  provides
              control flow, data dependence, and  control dependence information,  supporting
              required tools.   This representation must be efficient in terms of  both 
              construction time and storage space.  Algorithms that  accommodate program 
              modifications are sought.   Integration testing techniques make  use of the
              program  representation to validate interactions between procedures,  and
              practical regression testing techniques assist in  retesting program  after
              modifications.  Many of these  techniques are applicable to  object-oriented
              programs, but  additional techniques are being developed to test  individual 
              classes, selective regression testing techniques are extended  to identify the
              required testing in a subclass, and  both static and dynamic  analysis
              techniques are required  for the interaction among classes.  Finally, a
              prototype  system is being built to facilitate experiments, and  methods  for
              using the system in a distributed environment are investigated.
