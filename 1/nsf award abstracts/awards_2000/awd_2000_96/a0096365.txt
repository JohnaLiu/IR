Abstract    :
              A researcher from the University of Delaware will participate in two cruises to
              the Black Sea to conduct a biogeochemical study of the stoichiometries, rates
              and microbial involvement for reactions of reduced sulfur compounds with Mn
              (III, IV) and Fe (III) phases and for chemo-denitrification reactions (NO3-
              with Mn2+ and NH4+ with Mn3+, Mn4+) in suboxic ocean regions.  The PI also will
              carry out similar experiments in Chesapeake Bay to evaluate these reactions in
              a suboxic/anoxic environment where Fe concentrations are comparable with Mn
              values and thus can compete with Mn/N/S interactions.  Research from this study
              will result in high resolution nutrient, Mn/Fe and sulfur species data in
              suboxic and anoxic zones of the Black Sea and Chesapeake Bay using an in-situ
              voltammetric analyzer that can measure the redox species simultaneously.  In
              addition, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Washington
              and from Scripps, the PI will link the presence of chemical parameters to
              in-situ microbes by determining the distributions of sulfur oxidizing,
              nitrifying, denitrifying and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria.
