Abstract    :
              The Computer Science Department of Morehouse College is committed to developing
              a program in High Performance Computing (HPC) that will soon be fully
              integrated into the department's curricular structure as a part of the on-going
              effort to expand its academic offerings.  The purpose of the program is
              four-fold: a) to give the department an ample exposure to the available
              techniques and tools of HPC as alternative computational resources, b) to
              support the colleges proposed interdisciplinary programs in Neuroscience and
              Materials Science by introducing Scientific Computing into science education,
              c) to make available to the entire science community of the college the
              computational resources, and d) to expose the most talented students in that
              community to the fundamental concepts and practices of High Performance
              Computing.  The HPC program includes the recent acquisition of two MIMD
              shared-memory multiprocessors, the GP1000 and TC2000.
