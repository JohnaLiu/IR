Two of the most likely detectable sources of gravity waves
              are
oscillating neutron stars and black holes orbiting around each other
              In
order to study these waves and learn more about their sources,
              gravity
wave observatories are currently under construction around the
              world
This investigation will complete theoretical studies aimed at
              answering
the following important questions:
1. How does superfluidity and
              superconductivity believe to exist in
neutron stars affect the stability of
              these stars when they emit
gravity waves?
2. How does the emission of gravity
              waves affect the rotation rates of
these stars?
3. How will the theory
              developed here compare with neutron star rotation
rates as currently observed
              by radio telescopes?, and
4. What will new methods to be developed in this
              investigation tell us
about the inspiral of black hole binaries?

This work
              is of current interest and significance for several reasons.
Gravity waves
              carry to us the best information that can be obtained
about the strong
              gravitational field predictions of Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity.
              Their detection will provide insights into the
true nature of neutron stars
              and black holes. For example gravity waves
will be able to give the best
              direct evidence for the existence of
black holes. They should also provide key
              clues to determining the true
nature of the matter in neutron stars. This
              matter which is at several
times nuclear density cannot be studied in
              terrestrial laboratories.
One exciting prospect is that gravity waves might
              provide further
evidence that neutron stars really are superfluid and
              superconducting
inside. This would make neutron stars the highest
              temperature
superconductors in the universe However in order to extract the
              maximum
possible information from the gravity waves it will be necessary
              to
greatly improve the current understanding of the sources. Thus it
              is
imperative to the success of and the other gravity wave detectors that
the
              theory of the sources be worked out in detail. The investigation
described
              here will make major advances towards working out those
details.
