Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for the research program of the Syracuse
              University group which is focused on the weak decays of the b-quark and the
              c-quark.  Although the Standard Model of electroweak interactions has been very
              successful in explaining most phenomena, the model cannot explain the different
              quark and lepton masses or the different couplings between the quarks.  This
              group is looking for deviations in the data from the model, and in measuring
              several model parameters.
	The CLEO experiment at the Cornell Electron Storage
              Ring (CESR) electron-positron collider has been at the forefront of studies of
              both the b- and c-quarks.  For example, the B0, B+, and DS mesons were all
              discovered at CLEO.  The recent CLEO III upgrade has transformed the detector
              into a more powerful instrument by incorporating a new particle identification
              detector (RICH), new silicon-based vertex and tracking devices, and new fast
              electronics to accommodate increased luminosity from the CESR accelerator.  The
              RICH detector was designed, built, and commissioned by this group.
	The
              proton-antiproton Tevatron collider at Fermilab produces copious numbers of b-
              and c-quarks at rates 1000-10000 larger than at CESR.   However, the b-quark
              events must be extracted from hadronic backgrounds that are a factor of 1000
              larger than the signal, whereas at CESR the backgrounds are only a factor of
              four larger than the signals.  The BTeV experiment, designed to extend the
              physics reach of the electron-positron experiments, and whose co-spokesman is
              the PI of this group, has recently received stage one scientific approval from
              Fermilab management.
