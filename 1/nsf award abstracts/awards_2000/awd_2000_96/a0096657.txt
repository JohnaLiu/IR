Abstract    :
              The Museum of Comparative Zoology's collection of amphibians and reptiles is one
              of the world's largest and most important resources for systematic herpetology.
               Information stored in it is of great scientific value.  More than half the
              world's species are represented, including representatives of all families.  It
              is exceptionally rich in primary type specimens and important historical
              collections, which have figured prominently in the development of herpetology
              as a discipline and in the development of faunal work for particular areas or
              taxonomic groups.  The collection is heavily used by the international
              scientific community, as documented by the high frequency of loan requests, by
              the large number of primary research publications that are based wholly or in
              part on MCZ specimens, and by the many visitors who come to work in the
              collection.  The present project would relieve serious overcrowding by the
              purchase of a compactor system and new cabinets, making this important resource
              more easily accessible to the community.  The project is part of the second
              phase of a three-phase plan to renovate the physical facilities of the
              Department of Herpetology and modernize the Department's operations.
