Abstract    :
              The University of Alabama-Huntsville, in partnership with seven north Alabama
              school districts, proposes a five-year LSC project that will involve 160
              middle-grade teachers.  The districts are diverse ranging from rural to urban
              and the 11,500 students are from several traditionally underserved groups.  All
              grade 6-8 teachers, from the 47 elementary middle and high schools in the
              districts, will receive at least 130 hours of professional development that
              will focus on:
* Understanding of science content
* Ability to use
              inquiry-centered curriculum materials effectively
* Awareness of current
              research on science teaching and learning 
* Knowledge of diverse teaching
              practices that will enable them to reach all students
* A repertoire of
              assessment strategies that are aligned with instructional practices.
The major
              instructional materials to be implemented are Science and Technology Concepts
              for Middle Schools (STC/MS), FOSS and SEPUP.  The districts have already
              piloted the available field-test versions of the STC materials.
