This award provides support for participants from the United
              States and Africa in an  ICFA School/Workshop on Instrumentation in High Energy
              Physics, to be held at the National Accelerator Centre in Faure, South Africa,
              from March 26 - April 6, 2001.  The US organizer is Marleigh Sheaff, Department
              of Physics, University of Wisconsin.  The South African co-organizer is John
              Sharpey-Schaeffer, Director of the National Accelerator Centre.  The
              participants supported include postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. 
              This is the ninth in a series of schools/workshops organized by the
              International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA).  About half of the 80
              student participants will come from developing countries in Africa, the Near
              East, and South Asia.  The purpose of the workshop is to encourage increased
              participation by young physicists from these parts of the world in elementary
              particle physics experiments by providing them with the information and skills
              needed to undertake detector development for these experiments.  In addition,
              it is hoped that participation in this school will stimulate future
              collaborations among the students and senior lecturers.  The agenda includes
              lectures on state of the art instrumentation techniques and several hands-on
              laboratory courses.  This award is supported jointly by the Division of
              International Programs and the Division of Physics.
