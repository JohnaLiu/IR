The ribosome is the catalyst of peptide bond formation within
              all living organisms. The 50S ribosomal subunit of the ribosome contains the
              peptidyl transferase center where the peptide bonds are formed.  The recent
              high resolution crystal structure of the intact 50S subunit suggests that the
              peptidyl transferase center is composed exclusively of rRNA.  The unusual
              chemical basicity of a single nucleotide within the active site may allow it to
              serve as a general acid-base catalyst for peptide bond formation.  This implies
              that the ribosome is an RNA enzyme or ribozyme, though this has yet to be
              biochemically demonstrated.  The specific objective of this project is to
              demonstrate peptidyl transferase activity by an in vitro transcribed 23S rRNA
              in the absence of ribosomal proteins.  To achieve this objective a new version
              of the peptidyl transferase reaction that alleviates the artifactual reaction
              conditions required of the previously used fragment reaction will be utilized. 
              The structure of the 50S subunit will be employed to design truncated 23S rRNA
              fragments that are likely to fold into an active conformation.  These
              experiments are capable of providing definitive biochemical evidence to
              establish whether 23S rRNA is the catalyst of protein synthesis and will
              provide a biochemically amenable system for the analysis of the ribosomal
              reaction mechanism.
