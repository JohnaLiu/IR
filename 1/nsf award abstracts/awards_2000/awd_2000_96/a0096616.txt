Description:  This award supports the US-India Cooperative
              Research: Banach Algebra Techniques and Geometry of Banach Spaces.  US PI
              Krzysztof Jarosz of Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville and Indian PI
              T.S.S.R.K. Rao of the Indian Statistical Institute(ISI), Bangalore will
              initiate joint research on maps determining topology, local isometries, and
              other problems concerning Banach spaces and algebras.  The US side brings
              expertise in areas of function algebras and spaces of analytic functions; the
              Indian side has expertise in the geometry of Banach spaces.      
Scope:  This
              is a new collaboration with mathematicians at one of India's most highly
              respected institutes in this field.  It will provide the framework needed by
              Indian researchers to communicate with others working in modern functional
              analysis.  Among its strengths, this collaboration involves researchers with
              overlapping but not identical interests.  Thus far, the problems to be
              addressed have generated broad interest among mathematicians at several other
              institutions including the Indian Institutes of Technology at Madras and
              Mumbai.  The research is of high quality, is likely to result in some very
              worthwhile contributions to mathematical research, and will open up further
              avenues of cooperation between India and the United States.
