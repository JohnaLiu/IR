Abstract    :
              The aim of this proposal is to better understand the extent to which the
              oxidation of sulfide minerals is controlled by biologic processes.  In
              parallel, this study will also evaluate how much primary biological
              productivity (bacterial) is supported by sulfide minerals in the vicinity of
              hydrothermal vents.  The study uses samples previously collected at the
              Endevour and Middle Valley segments of Juan de Fuca.  Studies include RNA-based
              microbial surveys to determine the extent to which they live on sulfide
              surfaces, microscopic (fluoresence and SEM/EDX) analses to look for patterns of
              biological activity on various minerals, and laboratory culture studies. 
              Microbial diversity will be evaluated using seveal techniques including DNA
              extraction and analysis.
