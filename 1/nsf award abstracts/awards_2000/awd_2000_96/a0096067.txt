Abstract    :
              9513137  Haus    A three year cooperative research program is developed  between
              the experimental group of Prof. Kuon Inoue at  Hokkaido University in Sapporo,
              Japan and the theoretical  group of the PI at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
               The  subject of our investigations is dielectric materials with  periodicity
              in one-, two- and three-dimensions.  The topic  combines the strengths of two
              groups to explore the  potential of these new materials for applications in 
              optoelectronics, especially pulse propagation and nonlinear  effects. The
              experimental group is engaged in a number of  experiments on samples whose
              lattice spacing ranges from  millimeters to sub-microns; two- and
              three-dimensional  samples are of primary interest. The Japanese group has both
               microwave and optical characterization experiments underway  to  confirm
              specific theoretical predictions. The PI is  continuing numerical calculations
              and developing several  approaches from plane-waves to beam-propagation
              methods;  attention is devoted to convergence and reliability issues. 
              Analytical methods are concurrently being developed using  the multiple scales
              perturbation approach. The results are  applied to pulse propagation,
              dispersion and diffraction in  linear and nonlinear structures.  ***
