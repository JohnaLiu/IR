This project examines local perceptions of
              sociocultural and economic changes often associated with globalization
              processes in three subsistence-oriented Inupiat societies in the north Bering
              Strait region of Alaska. The study focuses on three ethnically related but
              sociopolitically, culturally, and economically distinct Inupiat communities: 
              people from Ingaliq on Little Diomede Island; from Wales, on the northeastern
              Bering Strait coast; and from King Island.  The study addresses change
              components that have influenced identity in the areas of foraging technologies
              and traditions.  It relies on a variety of methods, including participant
              observations and multigenerational family interviews.  The researchers will
              collaborate with a wide spectrum of residents in each community and will employ
              local adults and students as consultants, research assistants, and interns in
              an effort to provide locally meaningful research experiences.
