Abstract    :
              9730673  Ito         This is a numerical modeling and laboratory  experimental
              effort to study 3-D magma transport through the  oceanic mantle.  The
              objectives are to determine how  lithosperic properties and stresses control
              dike network  formation and the distribution of volcanism at the surface,  and
              to understand the efforts of magma soruce properties on  dike propagation in
              the lothospere.
