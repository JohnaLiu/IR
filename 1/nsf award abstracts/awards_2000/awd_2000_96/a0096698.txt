Abstract    :
              A number of factors are known to affect the timing of reproductive maturation in
              female primates, including humans.  Nutritional status is a well documented
              variable and there is some evidence that social stress also plays a role.  This
              study aims to disentangle the role of socio-ecological variables (both
              nutritional and social factors) on the timetable of reproductive maturation in
              captive adolescent female baboons (Papio hamadryas anubis).  More specifically,
              it is the goal of this study to determine how nutritional factors (body weight,
              skeletal growth, food intake) and social factors (relative dominance rank,
              amount of aggression received) affect (a) the timing of menarche/commencement
              of cycling, (b) the probability of ovulation, (c) the probability of becoming
              pregnant, and (d) the probability of successful first birth.  With adolescence
              existing as a marked developmental stage of significant duration in both
              non-human primates and humans, this study will provide insights into the
              origins and functions of this transitional stage of development.  In addition,
              this study will provide evidence as to the roles nutritional status and social
              stress play in the development and maintenance of regular and competent
              reproductive functioning, including reliable ovulation and the abilities of
              individual females to initiate and carry out successful pregnancies.
