Abstract    :
              Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are powerful technology tools that help
              create an inquiry-rich environment.  With GIS, students discover underlying
              patterns from locally collected data that can be connected to data from the
              larger community.  But GIS requires teachers to understand new content, new
              pedagogy and new technology.  This project provides materials for professional
              development of middle and high school teachers in effective use of GIS as an
              instructional strategy.  The GIS teacher enhancement materials are tied to two
              previously developed project-based curriculum units -- in atmospheric
              monitoring and biodiversity.  The materials are modified based upon pilot
              testing with teachers and professional developers.  The four learning units
              develop spatial reasoning in the use of maps, teach the use of GIS technologies
              using ARCView, enable the gathering and use of student data sets, and connect
              to existing model curricula.  The materials, developed with master teachers,
              are for workshops that deepen teachers' content knowledge, model pedagogy
              consistent with best practice, evaluate the effectiveness of learning
              opportunities, develop coaching with questioning strategies and provide
              information about student preconceptions.
