Abstract    :
              Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is induced after a local infection by
              necrotizing pathogens and renders uninfected parts of the plant resistant to a
              variety of normally virulent viruses, bacterial and fungi. SAR is associated
              with the inducible expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. In dicots,
              the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) is both necessary and sufficient for the
              induction of SAR. 
The NPR1 protein is a key regulator of SA-mediated SAR in
              Arabidopsis. npr1 mutants fail to express SAR related PR genes and display
              enhanced susceptibility to pathogen infection even after treatment with SA.
              Furthermore, over-expression of NPR1 in Arabidopsis leads to enhanced disease
              resistance to both bacterial and fungal pathogens in a dose-dependent manner.
              We have now shown that over-expression of NPR1 in rice leads to enhanced
              resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), a
              serious disease of rice throughout the world.  In addition, we have isolated
              three resistance signaling components from rice: a rice NPR1 homolog, NH1, and
              two genes that encode products that interact with NH1 and NPR1; a bZIP
              transcription factor, rTGA2.1, and a previously unidentified signaling
              component, NRR (Negative Regulator of disease Resistance).
The long-term goal
              of this proposal is to further elucidate the signal cascade governing plant
              disease resistance and to create novel strategies for disease control in rice
              and other cereal crops.
