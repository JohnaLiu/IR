              Prints of Antropogenic and Natural Climate Variability    Climate model
              simulations predict a change in the mean state of the climate due to
              anthropogenic changes but uncertainties remain as to what part of the observed
              warming can be attributed to this anthropogenic influence.  A combined
              application of two different methods to reduce uncertainty associated with
              estimates of the climate change signal is proposed here.  By this technique it
              is hoped to make more reliable estimates of the magnitude of the anthropogenic
              signal in the present climate record.
