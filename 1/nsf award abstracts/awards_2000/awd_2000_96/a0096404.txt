              ABSTRACT

OCE-00996404


The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide
              (N2O), one of the major greenhouses of Earth, has increased since the beginning
              of global industrialization.  The reasons for the increase are not understood,
              but evidence suggests that as much as 50% the input to the atmosphere derives
              from the ocean.  There is a clear need to constrain the sources and fluxes of
              marine N2O.

In this project researchers at the Scripps Institution of
              Oceanography and the National Center for Atmospheric research will conduct a
              model and data analysis study of ocean N2O production, nitrification,  and
              denitrification. The study aims to provide an updated estimate of the ocean N2O
              source using newly  available surface N2O data and gas transfer methods. Both
              the magnitude and distribution of the ocean  source will be examined in this
              analysis, with particular attention to the importance of coastal and  suboxic
              regions. A second goal of the study is to explore the relationships among ocean
              N2O, O2 , and  nutrients in global and regional data sets.  The ocean N2O
              source predicted by this modeling investigation will be  compared to that
              estimated from surface N2O data using gas transfer methods.  Nonconventional
              mechanisms, including  denitrification and N2O production in anoxic microzones
              of sinking organic matter, will be tested as well.  Additional goals of the
              biogeochemistry/transport model study include estimating how ocean N2O 
              emissions may have changed under past climate conditions and examining how
              links between the  biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and carbon may lead to
              correlated variations in ocean N2O and CO2  fluxes.
