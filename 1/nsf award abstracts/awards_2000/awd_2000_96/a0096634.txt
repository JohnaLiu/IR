Abstract    :
              The 187Os/188Os of  abyssal peridotites show a wide range from values near those
              expected for primitive depleted mantle, to higher and lower values. The higher
              values may be explained by interaction of abyssal peridotites with sea water.
              This proposal is for a 1-yr pilot study to explore the possibility that
              chromite grains in the AP may be used to extract real values of 187Os/188Os
              unaffected by seawater. Preliminary data are presented. In stage 2, the PIs
              will analyze chromites from suites of normal and plume-affected abyssal
              peridotites.
