This award will supply shipboard
              scientific support equipment for the research vessel Savannah operated by
              Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO), University of Georgia and dedicated
              to use in support of marine research.  The Shipboard Scientific Support
              Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the
              proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. The Program provides support
              for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research
              sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data
              retrieval sites.  The Project Director, Braxton Tesh is fully qualified to
              direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.  This project will allow
              the institution to acquire a gyro compass and auto pilot, radar, GMDSS VHF
              Radio, escape breathing apparatus, GPS, digital fathometer, EPIRB, and
              immersion suits through a group purchase made by LDEO (no monetary award for
              SkIO).
