Abstract    :
              This RUI award provides funding for the continuation of the PI's research
              program in electron scattering off atoms.  In the coming period, the PI will
              measure differential cross sections, using a method of mixtures, and
              differential cross-section ratios of the electron-impact excitation of neon and
              argon from the ground state to the first excited state.  The ratio measurements
              will provide sensitive tests of both target structure as well as scattering
              dynamics in theoretical models.
