Abstract    :
              This project is a workshop focused on developing a coordinated data management
              strategy for the marine geology and geophysics community.  The goals of the
              workshop are to:  educate the MG&G community about current data management
              efforts and possible models for future efforts, define the data management
              problems that face the MG&G community, and define the parameters for solutions
              to the problems.
