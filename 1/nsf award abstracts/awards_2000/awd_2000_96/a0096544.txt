This award to University of Alaska Fairbanks provides
              instrumentation to update and expand the oceanographic research capabilities of
              the research vessel Alpha Helix, a ship operated by the University's Institute
              of Marine Science as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
              System (UNOLS) research fleet.  Specific instrumentation supported here
              includes two fluorometers plus interfacing to attach to an existing MOCNESS net
              system, ten water sampling bottles, and an upgrade of an existing optical
              plankton counter to a laser version of same.  These improvements will be of
              substantial advantage to marine scientists using the ship in their research
              during 2001 and future years.
