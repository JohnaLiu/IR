Dekany, R.
"Tomographic Wavefront Sensing for Adaptive
              Optics"
AST-0096928

Using a new, multiple channel wavefront sensor in
              conjunction with the
existing Palomar Adaptive Optics System, the researchers
              will conduct experiments 
in atmospheric tomography to reconstruct the
              three-dimensional distribution of
refractive index fluctuations about the 5m
              telescope at Palomar Mountain.
This information will be used to answer
              fundamental questions on the time
evolution of these index fluctuations,
              including the stability of discreet
turbulence layers in the atmosphere.  This
              information will guide the
development of future advanced adaptive optics
              systems that use multiple
deformable mirrors to uniformly correct wide fields
              of view, extending the
usable scientific field for adaptive optics and
              enabling new scientific
programs.
