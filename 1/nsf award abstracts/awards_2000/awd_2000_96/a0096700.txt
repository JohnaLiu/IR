Abstract    :
              This project aims at developing the basis for an innovative and durable concrete
              bridge deck, made with high performance fiber reinforced cement composites
              (HPFRCC) and reinforced with only one layer of bottom rebars (steel or FRP). 
              The HPFRC composite is designed to allow the creation of an effective plastic
              hinge mechanism, with hinges forming at supports and in spans. It also replaces
              shrinkage and temperature reinforcements in two directions and reduces crack
              widths by orders of magnitude, thus leading to an exceptional deck durability. 
              When the bottom reinforcement is prestressed, beneficial secondary moments
              created at the supports improve overall performance.
