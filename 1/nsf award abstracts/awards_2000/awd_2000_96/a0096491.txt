Molecules are found in many different environments in the
              Universe and are excellent probes of their surroundings.  Analysis of molecular
              spectral features yields important information, but more comprehensive analysis
              requires the comparison of many observations with detailed chemical and
              physical models of the assorted sources.  In a continuing research program, Dr.
              Eric Herbst, at the Ohio State University, hopes to understand and utilize
              chemistry to explain and guide astronomical observations of molecules, and to
              better our understanding of assorted interstellar and circumstellar objects. 
              During this award period, Dr. Herbst will pursue a wide variety of modeling
              studies, with concomitant improvements to his standard gas-phase and gas-grain
              models.  He will pay particular attention to the environments of star-forming
              regions of interstellar clouds.  He will also concentrate on improving his
              grain surface chemistry, since new experiments and theories are now beginning
              to bring some understanding to this field.
