Abstract    :
              The National Center for Science Education proposes to develop a website on
              evolution and the nature of science for K-12 teachers.  This project,
              "WWW.Evolution," aims to improve teacher understanding of the nature of
              science, the patterns and processes of evolution, and the history of
              evolutionary thought and to increase their ability to teach these subjects
              effectively.  The Site will also provide teachers with classroom resources,
              including a selection of effective approaches and teaching strategies and a
              searchable database of curricula, teacher-tested activities, and lesson plans,
              which are consistent with those modeled in the National Science Education
              Standards.  The evaluation of the project will include multiple aspects of the
              proposed website and its constituent elements, ranging from its appeal and
              utility to its ability to help users understand new concepts and acquire
              strategies for -- and confidence in -- teaching evolution.
