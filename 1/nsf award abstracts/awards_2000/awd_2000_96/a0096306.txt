Abstract    :
              9803177  Weaver    The proposed program aims to investigate the interactions of 
              fluorine with silicon surfaces, the modifications that are  brought about by
              etching, and the atomic-scale interactions  that underlie material removal. 
              The fluorine-silicon (100)  system is an ideal model system because problems
              can be  addressed that are of broad importance, namely how ideal  surfaces
              develop "corrosive layers" when exposed to  reactants and how multilayer
              etching competes with layer-by-  layer etching.  Atomic-resolution scanning
              tunneling  microscopy would be used to investigate fluorine  chemisorption and
              fluorine-fluorine repulsive interactions  in the adlayer.  Studies have been
              designed that would  determine the atomic sequency of events leading to silicon
               difloride desorption and the implications vis-a-vis layer-by-  layer etching
              with silicon defluoride.  Others would focus  on corrosive-layer silicon
              tetrafluoride eteching, the  nucleation of fluorosilyl structures on the
              surface, and the  strucural consequences of material removal from these 
              disordered layers.  %%%  These studies of fluorine etching of silicon are
              pertinent  to modern technologies based on silicon and other  semiconductors. 
              In the $700b microelectronics industry, for  example, the majority of the 1018
              transistors produced in  1997 were carved into monolithic pieces of silicon
              using  themethods of chemical etching.  The shapes, positions, and  registry of
              these structures are controlled with sub-micron  accuracy.  This project
              focuses on the underlying chemical  and physical processes responsible for this
              etching.  Deeper  insights are needed to achieve dfurther miniaturization for 
              tomorrow's circuitry.  ***
