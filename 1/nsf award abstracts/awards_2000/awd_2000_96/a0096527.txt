This research examines the phenomenon of
              microwave-assisted reactions in the liquid state to synthesize nanophase metal
              powders, such as Cu, Ni, Pt, Pd, Au, and Ag.  This novel microwave-polyol
              process reduces metal hydroxides or other salts with ethylene glycol, which
              serves as a solvent as well as a reducing agent.  Preliminary results show that
              nanophase metal powders can be produced rapidly by microwave catalysis.  The
              synthesis of nanophase metal powders associated kinetics are investigated for
              this technique, and the results are compared to the conventional refluxing
              process in ethylene glycol at 195 degrees C.  Heterogeneous and homogeneous
              nuclei are added during microwave-polypol processing to better understand the
              nucleation and growth steps.
%%%
Monodisperse metal powders are expected to
              be valuable in conductive inks and in pastes that could be employed for a
              variety of applications such as electronic thick film technology.
