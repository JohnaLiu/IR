Support is being provided for the travel expenses of speaker
              participants of four mini-symposia presented at the 20th annual meeting of the
              Society of Physical Regulation in Biology and Medicine, held in Charleston, SC,
              January 10-14, 2001. Two of the mini-symposia are in the newer areas of
              investigation Tissue Engineering and Nanotechnology in Medicine and the other
              two symposia address advanced topics in Biomechanical Force and Cell Regulation
              and Mechanical Control of Cardiovascular Cell and Muscle Processes. The topics
              included in the symposia are of growing importance in biomedical engineering
              research in fostering the development of such new medical
              technologies.

Post-conference publication of manuscripts from the
              mini-symposia is to be made in a special volume of the journal Biomedical Micro
              Devices (Kluwer Publishers).
