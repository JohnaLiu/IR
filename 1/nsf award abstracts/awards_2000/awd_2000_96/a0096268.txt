Abstract    :
              The purpose of the proposal is to study  the connections between algebraic
              geometry, topology and number theory. Specifically, at issue is the
              relationship between the
topology of a variety and the Kodaira dimension.
              Furthermore,
the project will  investigate the degeneration of varieties
and
              their application to solving diophantine equations over
local fields.

The
              aim of the  research here  is to furnish a theoretical
understanding about 
              which shapes can be described
efficiently with equations. Such shapes  include
              curves and surfaces but also
higher dimensional shapes in higher dimensional
              spaces. Of special
interest is a description of parametrized shapes, since
              this provides fast algorithms for computational purposes.
