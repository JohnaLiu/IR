Abstract    :
              This K-8 Local Systemic Change mathematics project funds professional growth
              activities for teachers and administrators in Harvey Public Schools District
              152.  A component of this three-year project is to enhance the district's
              infrastructure to support on-going improvements in mathematics teaching and
              learning.  Implementation of two reform mathematics curricula -- "Math
              Trailblazers in Grades K-5" and "Connected Mathematics in Grades 6-8" --
              provide the tools for developing strong professional communities of teachers,
              administrators and parents committed to improving mathematics instruction in
              the district.  The results of the project will add to an emerging body of
              knowledge about standards-based curricula implementation in poor, urban
              communities.

The project is a partnership among the Institute for
              Mathematics and Science Education of the University of Illinois at Chicago
              (UIC), the Harvey Public Schools, and the North Central Mathematics and Science
              Consortium at the U.S. Department of Education's North Central Regional
              Educational Laboratory (NCREL).  UIC's Teaching Integrated Mathematics and
              Science (TIMS) Project will direct the K-5 component of the project, which
              involves 102 K-5 teachers.  The North Central Mathematics and Science
              Consortium will fund and direct the component for 17 middle-grades teachers.
