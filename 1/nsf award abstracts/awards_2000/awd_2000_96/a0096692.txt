Abstract    :
              Spiral waves are a dynamical behavior of excitable media, that is, media in
              which small changes from the rest state die out and large changes generate
              oscillatory behavior.  Examples of excitable media in biology include the
              heart, the retina, and calcium waves in various organs, such as the intestine. 
              Chemical systems also exhibit these types of changes and provide a model system
              for studying how onset and stability of spiral waves are affected by different
              factors present in biological systems.  The chemical reaction will be analyzed
              both mathematically and computationally.  Results should lead to a better
              understanding of dynamical regime of spiral wave onset and stability in
              biological systems.
