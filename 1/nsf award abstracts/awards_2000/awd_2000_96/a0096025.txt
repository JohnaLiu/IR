This proposal is to conduct research in three related areas
              concerning the anisotropic structure of the inner core and the rotation of the
              inner core.  1)  The study will seek to constrain inner core rotation by
              simultaneously inverting the inner core rotation rate and small-scale lateral
              changes of inner core anisotropy using differential PKP travel-time
              measurements along source-station paths with a long history of recording.  2) 
              The study will constrain 3-D seismic anisotropy by increasing lateral and depth
              samples of the inner core.  3)  The research will search for variable inner
              core rotation using decades of continuous seismic records at College, Alaska
              station and neighboring stations.  Improved measurement of inner core rotation
              has implications for the geodynamo and angular momentum exchanges within the
              Earth's interior, and refined characterization of the inner core anisotropy is
              important in understanding the source of the anisotropy and the evolution and
              dynamics of the Earth's core.
