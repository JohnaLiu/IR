Abstract    :
              Submitted under the guidelines for "Local Systemic Change through Teacher
              Enhancement," this five-year project has as its goal to systemically guide
              professional growth for every elementary and middle school mathematics teacher
              in the district through professional development, team planning and
              collaboration, and collegial coaching.  The project -- a partnership between
              New Mexico State University and Gadsden Independent School District -- develops
              a sustainable school and community base to support the implementation of
              curriculum and instruction aligned with New Mexico Education Standards and the
              National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Curriculum and Professional
              Development Standards.  The 1,200 square mile district lies along the border of
              New Mexico and Mexico and serves about 13,000 students.  There are twelve
              elementary schools and three middle schools.  More than 50% of the students
              experience English language deficiencies.  Ninety-two percent of the students
              are of Latino/Hispanic origin.  Approximately 94% of the students qualify for
              the Free and Reduced School Lunch Program.  The school drop-out rate, as early
              as middle school, is high.  Nine of the twelve elementary schools and all three
              middle schools will be on probationary status as over 75% of the students
              scored below Proficient on the state mandated test.  The project provides 130
              hours of formal professional development as summer institutes and academic year
              follow-up.  The elementary grades will use "Investigations in Number, Data and
              Space" while the middle grades will use "Connected Mathematics."   There are
              450 teachers in the district.
