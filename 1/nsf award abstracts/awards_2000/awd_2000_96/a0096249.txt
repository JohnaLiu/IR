     This grant is awarded
              through the Separations and Purification Program 
     sub-element of the
              Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of 
     the Chemical and
              Transport Systems Division. The principal 
     investigator is Dr. William
              Krantz at the University of Colorado.  
     Research equipment funds are
              requested to purchase an Environmental 
     Scanning Electron Microscope
              (ESEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray 
     analysis. The instrument will be
              used to support research in membrane 
     science, catalysis, biotechnology
              and frozen soils in the Department 
     of Chemical Engineering and in the
              NSF Industry/University Cooperative 
     Research center for Separations
              using Thin Films. 
     
     The Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope
              permits high resolution 
     structural and elemental analysis at up to 50
              million times larger 
     than conventional Scanning Electron Microscopes. It
              is particularly 
     useful for research involving nonconducting and/or
              thermally sensitive 
     polymeric and inorganic membranes, biofouling
              layers, catalysts, 
     ceramic materials, microbial systems and frozen
              soils. In addition to 
     knowledge generation benefits, acquisition of the
              instrument will 
     benefit  hands-on learning experiences for students.
