Low-temperature magnetic measurements are increasingly used
              in applications of rock magnetism to studies of plate tectonics, the history of
              the Earth's magnetic field and global environmental change.  These measurements
              make use of phase transitions that occur below room temperature in some
              magnetic minerals.  The investigators will develop the first quantitative
              theory for changes in magnetic remanence across phase transitions.  The
              theoretical work will place strong constraints on possible mechanisms for
              pseudo-single-domain remanence and acquisition of thermoremanent magnetization.
               Combining theoretical and experimental work, the investigators will use low
              temperature demagnetization to improve paleointensity measurements and provide
              a physical interpretation of remagnetization in Paleozoic carbonates.
