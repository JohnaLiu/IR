Abstract    :
                The central objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between
              childhood economic deprivation and several early adult outcomes, including (1)
              the timing and sequencing of family formation, (2) school completion and
              socioeconomic attainment, and (3) avoiding antisocial and self-destructive
              behaviors and practicing prosocial behaviors. The proposed study uses recent
              young adult supplements of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY).
              These data will be linked to records from earlier NLSY samples including mother
              and family records, adults' assessments of childhood development, and
              neighborhood indicators specially created from zip-code addresses provided by
              the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the first time. There are three specific
              objectives: to use these data to describe and model the economic trajectories
              of `at risk` young adults during childhood; to estimate the deleterious effects
              of family income trajectories during childhood on critical indicators of
              successful adjustment in late adolescence and early adulthood; to evaluate the
              causal mechanisms underlying these connections, as well as identify the
              moderating influences of neighborhood and family context on successful early
              adult transitions. The overriding objective is to bring together several
              disparate literatures in a unified theoretical and analytical framework. The
              study will provide a unique opportunity to examine the first generation of `at
              risk` adults who grew up with the major social and economic upheavals of the
              past two decades.
