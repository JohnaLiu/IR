This project is a cooperative between the University of
 Arizona
              (Tragoudas) and Southern illinois University at
 Carbondale (Kagaris).
This
              project is exploring a framework for designing easily  testable cores. The
              method is based on the ability to  identify disjoint components in the core,
              called CCs (core  components),for which no implementation details are 
              released. Netlist information is provided for the remaining  portion of the
              core.  The CCs must guarantee that the  predesigned intellectual property of
              the core is protected  and that the testing process is simplified. Functional 
              faults are detected by initially testing each CC in  isolation using either
              Built-In Self-Testing (BIST) or scan  techniques. Subsequently, the remaining
              portion of the core  is tested using scan techniques while bypassing the CCs. 
              Path delay faults may require functional level testing for  the selected CCs.
              Problems being investigated are: (1)  Determining the number, sizes, locations
              of the CCs, and the  type of Built-In Test mechanism within each CC. (2) 
              Developing BIST schemes and DFT methodologies that assist in  generating the
              CCs within the core.
