Abstract    :
              9724286  Hammond, Kristian  Swain, Michael  University of Chicago    Acquisition
              of Computational Resources for the Development of an Intelligent Information
              Laboratory    The University of Chicago is acquiring application and file
              servers, workstations and network support to provide a computer-environment for
              supporting a newly-formed Intelligent Information Laboratory dedicated to the
              discovery of technology that forms a bridge between people and machines. 
              Research thrusts making up the core technologies of the laboratory are
              question/answer interfaces to information resources, example-driven preference
              browsing, image search and classification on the World Wide Web, and clustering
              documents to aid in information retrieval.    The proposed equipment will be
              available for use by graduate and undergraduate students in research projects. 
              One of the goals of the Intelligent Information Laboratory is to create and
              support intelligent information tools for the Internet.  The University already
              has helped to get a selection of Chicago's inner city high-schools on-line and
              to provide support in the areas of digital libraries and educational tool
              development.  The University plans to produce software on the new equipment and
              modify it for use in the high schools as well as to offer summer programs on
              Internet strategies for teachers.
