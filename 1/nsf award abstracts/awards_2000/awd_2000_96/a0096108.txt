Abstract    :
              Motoneurons are the nerve cells that send signals to muscle fibers, to make them
              contract and produce movements.  When an embryonic insect larva develops
              through metamorphosis into an adult with legs and wings, there are major
              changes in the branching and target patterns of the motoneurons.  It remains
              unclear how this plastic change is regulated to produce the correct adult
              functional connections, the synapses, between nerve cells and the appropriate
              other nerve cells and muscles.  This project uses molecular biological
              techniques to obtain genomic fragments from subsets of motor neurons from the
              fruitfly, Drosophila.  These will be used to identify sequence comparisons with
              known genes and proteins from Drosophila and from vertebrates.  Results will
              for the first time allow direct comparisons of the continuity between embryonic
              and adult motor neurons at the molecular level, and will have impact also on
              understanding synaptic plasticity in general.  This POWRE award will enhance
              the research capabilities of a young woman scientist by providing training in
              the latest molecular biological techniques.
