Abstract    :
              This project will create the first computer-based key and digital image guide
              for Amazonian pollen.  The diversity of vascular plants in Amazonia is
              incredibly high and may exceed 80,000 species.  Because of this diversity,
              identifying pollen can be extremely difficult.  The key, which will be
              developed from a comprehensive collection of high-resolution digital images
              taken from vouchered herbarium materials, will greatly facilitate the
              identification of pollen.  The proposed collection of images will contain
              20,000 images of ca. 3,000 species.  Although this appears to be a small
              portion of the 80,000 species present in Amazonia, that fact reflects the state
              of our knowledge and the enormity of the task facing taxonomists who are trying
              to document the biodiversity of tropical rainforests.  This project will be an
              important step toward facilitating identification of a large component of the
              biodiversity.  

The database developed will prolong the usefulness of pollen
              reference collections and broaden access to modern pollen reference collections
              by providing keys and images in digital format (WWW and CD-ROM). This will
              represent the first herbarium-based pollen flora for the Amazon basin, and an
              order of magnitude more taxa  than in the largest of the published
              fossil-pollen guides.  Morphological data and digital images will be stored in
              a relational (FileMaker Pro 5), and macros will be  written to allow use of the
              database as a multiple access key.  Advantage will be taken of the graphics
              capability of computers to provide a visual, rather than text-based, key to
              pollen types.  The key and images will be useful for teaching palynology and
              for research on current and Pleistocene floras of Amazonia.
