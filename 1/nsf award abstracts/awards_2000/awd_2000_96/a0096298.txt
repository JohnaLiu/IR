Abstract    :
              Gilbert  & Parker  University of California-Berkeley & -Santa Cruz  DEB -
              9806517 &  9808501    A central question in the ecology of invading organisms
              involves why some introduced plant species fail to succeed in a habitat while
              others become noxious invaders with high populations.  Two competing theories
              have been posed to answer this question focusing on the role of natural enemies
              in regulating the population dynamics of invading plant species. The natural
              enemies hypothesis, the foundation for classical biological control programs,
              proposes that successful invaders leave behind the pests and pathogens that
              control them in their home habitats.  The biotic resistance hypothesis suggests
              that most invading organisms are the successful targets of natural herbivores
              and pathogens and that successful invasions are the exception to the usual run
              of things. This project will test these two hypotheses using clover and
              burclover as a model system. It will examine plant-pathogen interactions using
              a combination of field and greenhouse experiments to compare native vs. exotic
              clovers in trying to sort through situations in different locations.  It will
              test the prediction that disease resistance should be more prevalent in native
              hosts - consistent with the biotic resistance hypothesis.
