Abstract    :
              9705397  Goldman    The Institute for Research on Learning is undertaking a
              multifaceted effort to help parents become more involved in the mathematics
              education of their children.  This project establishes a Design Consortium;
              develops new materials and collaborative activity structures; provides
              outreach, training, and technical assistance to communities; and disseminates
              these products to the educational community.  The design consortium creates
              contexts for raising parent participation in communities where it is most
              needed and uses these contexts to plan and construct mathematics materials
              based on issues parents face in everyday life. The outreach activities include
              planning support and workshops for schools, community organizations, and parent
              groups.  Dissemination is done through presentations and talks and through
              research articles.
