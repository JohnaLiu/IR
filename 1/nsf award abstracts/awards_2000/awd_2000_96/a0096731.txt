Abstract    :
              This award supports the development of a new instrument for measurement of
              real-time quantitative kinetics of biomolecular binding through use of
              all-optical surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based methods.  Existing SPR-based
              instrumentation is commonly used to study interactions of polymers and other
              molecules, including small ligands and proteins.  The proposed instrument will
              employ a multi-channel biosensor array format, and use multi-wavelength
              excitation and angular scanning capabilities to optimize sensitivity and time
              response. Novel SPR methods, developed previously in the PI's laboratory, are
              expected to provide far greater sensitivity and improved coverage for unlabeled
              biomolecules in comparison to existing SPR instruments. Software to be
              developed for data analysis will incorporate detailed modeling of association
              and dissociation kinetics using self-consistent global analysis methods for
              multiple measurements and new kinetic models also developed in the PI's
              laboratory.
The instrument to be developed provides simultaneous monitoring of
              binding kinetics for 16 different channels (4 independent flow cells) with a
              time response expected to be in the range of 1 millisecond. Judicious choice of
              excitation and detection frequencies will take full advantage of the optical
              characteristics of the particular ligands under study; this is expected to
              provide an additional 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than
              current SPR-based biosensors
