Abstract    :
              Funds are recommended for a 3-year project to study the seismic and density
              structure beneath the Bermuda hotspot swell. A combined refraction and
              reflection seismic survey is planned for year 1 and analysis of the data in
              years 2 and 3. The study will try to address a fundamental question in
              geodymanics, i.e., what is the reason for large areal relief associated with
              some hotspot volcanics? The survey will determine what portion of the swell is
              supported by crustal underplating and how the existence of the underplating may
              have influenced the history of the vertical motion for Bermuda.
