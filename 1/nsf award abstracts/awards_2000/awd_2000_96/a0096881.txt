A highly sensitive spectrometer designed
              specifically to observe Extragalactic objects for point source spectroscopy in
              the submillimeter (350, 450, and 610 micrometer) bands with an instantaneous
              bandwidth of 6.7 GHz. will be designed, engineered, built, calibrated and
              applied to acquire data to: Investigate star formation in the early universe,
              measure redshifts of optically obscured distant galaxies, investigate the
              sources in Ultraluminous galaxies (originally discovered by IRAS) using
              spectroscopy, and investigate proto-galaxies.  This new instrument is a
              background limited moderate resolution spectrometer called SAGE for
              Submillimeter Array Grating Explorer.
