"A Phase-Binning CCD for Optical Pulsar Studies: Polarization

This research will
              improve the currently existing electronics in a phase-binning CCD system,
              previously supported by NSF funds, for sensitive photopolarimetry of pulsations
              in the optical light of pulsars.   The camera will be implemented at the CTIO
              4-m telescope to obtain phased photopolarimetric data of moderately faint
              (V=23.4) Southern Hemisphere pulsars. The detection of optical pulsations will:
              1. Provide unambiguous identification of the optical counterpart of pulsars
              where the counterpart is believed to be known and in those where it is
              definitely not; 2. Distinguish between thermal and non-thermal emission
              mechanisms producing the optical light; 3. Allow a measurement of the
              temperature of old neutron stars which are weak or absent in the X-ray band;
              and 4. Permit a search for evidence of heating by exotic processes such as
              magnetic monopoles.
