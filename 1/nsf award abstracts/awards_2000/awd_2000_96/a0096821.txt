The Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in Observational Astronomy at
              Cornell will continue to support eight undergraduate students in the summer for
              eight weeks.  Students will work directly with faculty and research associates
              in the department of Astronomy and Space Sciences on a variety of projects
              including optical, infrared, radio/radar, planetary and high-energy
              astrophysics topics.  The students' research at Cornell will also provide them
              the opportunity to participate in astronomical observations at facilities used
              by Cornell researchers, such as Palomar Observatory, Arecibo Observatory, and
              other National Astronomy Centers.  Opportunities and funding for students to
              travel to scientific meetings will be made available.  Students will attend a
              lecture seminar twice a week by the Astronomy faculty on a wide range of
              astronomical topics.  The students will be encouraged to present their research
              findings in a department research forum at the end of their term.  The
              Undergraduate Observational Astronomy research program will continue to
              emphasize those students who are women and underrepresented groups and whose
              own institutions do not provide this type of research experience.  Special
              efforts will continue to facilitate the logistical and cultural aspects of the
              students' research experience at Cornell.
