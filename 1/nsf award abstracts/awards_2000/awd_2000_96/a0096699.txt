Abstract    :
              The Autonomous Undersea Systems Institute (AUSI) will conduct a scientific
              feasibility study on a Solar Powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (SAUV) that
              it has been developing in conjunction with the Institute for Marine Technology
              Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Under ONR funding, the vehicle
              will undergo a series of engineering tests to validate its ability to conduct
              long endurance sampling tasks. The NSF-funded tests will be conducted in
              conjunction with Hawaii Ocean Time-series program (HOT), and involves the
              integration of scientific instruments on the SAUV. A CTD, O2 sensor,
              fluorometer, and radiometer will be added to the SAUV system. Resulting data
              will be compared with ship and buoy-based measurements for inter-calibration
              and to enhance interpretation. If successful, the SAUV will provide the
              oceanographic science community, with a tool for collecting real time data, on
              a near continual basis, within 800 meters of the ocean surface, for a minimum
              of 30 days, without the need for a support vessel.
