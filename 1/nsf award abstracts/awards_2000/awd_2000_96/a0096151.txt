	Research in astrophysics and cosmology will focus on the
              formation of the large-scale structure we see in the distribution of galaxies
              in the universe.  The tools necessary to understand how the very small
              irregularities first measured by NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)
              satellite grew to form the large chains and knots of galaxies seen in recent
              surveys of the sky will be developed.  An understanding of these processes
              promises to shed light upon the physics of the very early universe and offers
              the possibility of measuring many of the fundamental cosmological parameters
              such as the speed with which the universe is expanding and whether there is
              enough matter to halt the expansion in the distant future.
