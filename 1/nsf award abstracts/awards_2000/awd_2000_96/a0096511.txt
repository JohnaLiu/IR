Abstract    :
              This five-year Teacher Enhancement project will create Professional Development
              Materials for teachers of physical science and physics with an emphasis on the
              K-8 grade levels.  It is envisioned that professionals who deliver physical
              science/physics workshops for K-8 teachers will use the materials in short
              courses and workshops.  The materials will be developed and piloted in summer
              institutes at the University of Washington and in other venues nationwide,
              including at professional meetings.  Both print and computer-based materials
              will be guided by discipline-based physics education research conducted by the
              Physics Education Group at the University of Washington.
