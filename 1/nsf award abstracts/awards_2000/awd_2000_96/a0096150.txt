Abstract    :
              This research explores methods and techniques for a design and simulation 
              environment with the target application being high performance and high
              frequency  communication circuits. Within the simulation environment a designer
              will have  access to a suite of models of varying accuracy and to analysis
              capabilities that  address the needs of high frequency design.  The analysis
              capabilities include  periodic-steady state solution for  RF circuits,
              calculation of noise and  distortion in the periodic-steady state, substrate
              coupling and electrothermal  interactions. The research is partitioned into
              three areas: (i) development of  new analysis capabilities for an integrated
              device-circuit- behavioral simulation  environment;  (ii) improvement of
              simulator performance so that it is valuable  to  designers of high performance
              and/or high frequency analog circuits,  and  (iii) application of the simulator
              to realistic design problems with  particular  emphasis on RFICs. A virtual lab
              environment is being developed to provide  students training in circuit/device
              simulation and tool development  with  applications to real life design
              examples.
