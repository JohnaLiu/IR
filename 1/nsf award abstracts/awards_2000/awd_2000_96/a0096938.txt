Description:  This award is for support of a joint research
              project by Dr. M. Gregory Forest, Professor, Department of Mathematics,
              University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina and Dr. Otis C.
              Wright, Mathematics and Computer Science Department at the United Arab Emirates
              University, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates (UAE). The research addresses the
              nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation with nonlinearity, which is the governing
              equation of envelope pulse propagation in any weakly dispersive and nonlinear
              system.  The purpose of the collaboration is to build on results already
              obtained for the defocusing NLS equation and the coupled NLS system of
              equations, and the application of these results to optical pulse transmission. 
              

Scope:  This award will allow a US scientist to collaborate with a
              scientist working in the UAE.  Dr. Wright is a US scientist working abroad.  He
              is a recent Ph.D. graduate who is engaged in educating young college students
              in a foreign country where it is likely that little research in his field is
              being carried out.  It is important for him to maintain his collaboration with
              scientists in the United States at this stage in areas where there is mutual
              benefit.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting US-foreign
              scientific collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.  The Division of
              International Programs and the Division of Mathematics provide funding for this
              project.
