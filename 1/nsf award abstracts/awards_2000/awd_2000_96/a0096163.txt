              Abstract, Bass, 9700634       The project will address three areas of geometric
              group  theory.  The first concerns group actions on trees, particularly tree 
              lattices, i.e. discrete groups of automorphisms of locally finite trees  with
              finite volume quotients.  This theory is a discrete analogue of  the theory of
              Fuchsian groups acting on the upper half plane.  The  second area is the
              representation theory of finitely generated groups,  and particularly the
              structure of rigid groups, i.e. those with only  finitely many irreducible
              representations in each dimension.  When also  linear, these are conjecturally
              of arithmetic type.  The third area  concerns algebraic group actions on affine
              space, and, in particular,  flat families of representations of reductive
              groups, and the extent to  which these are globally equivariant vector bundles.
                   The project is an investigation of certain groups of  symmetries of
              various kinds of geometric structures.  In the first  instance these are
              infinite trees, ( i.e. connected graphs without  closed circuits), and our
              symmetry groups are discrete, and act with  say finitely many orbits.  In the
              second setting, we study finitely  generated groups via their matrix
              representations, particularly for  groups that have "very few" of these.  In
              the last case we study Lie  groups acting algebraically, but possibly non
              linearly, on Euclidean  spaces, and try to determine when certain such actions
              are  "approximately linear."
