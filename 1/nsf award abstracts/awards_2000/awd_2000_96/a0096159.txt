Abstract    :
                 The production of phytoplankton in the ocean is know to be limited under some
              circumstances by the amount of iron (and perhaps other trace metals) available
              to them.  Not every chemical form of these trace metals can be utilized by
              these organisms.  Since the most important of these from a biological
              standpoint is iron, which readily forms colloids in seawater, it is important
              from  marine ecological and geochemical perspectives to understand how
              available colloidal is to the phytoplankton and how iron and other trace metals
              move into and out of the colloidal phase.   In this project, the principal
              investigators will undertake a study of iron and six other biologically active
              trace metals in the waters of the continental shelf of central California. 
              Using a relatively new technique called cross-flow filtration, the distribution
              of iron and the other trace metals in dissolved and colloidal phases (different
              size classes) will be examined.  In particular the biological availability of
              iron and other trace metals in the colloidal phases will be investigated by
              running shipboard incubations and also by in situ comparisons of colloid-metal
              distributions and  plankton production in the water column.
