Dingus
This proposal is to support the research program in gamma-ray
              astronomy of Professor Brenda L. Dingus at the University of Utah.  The two
              elements of the program are (1) a continuation of work on the Milagro
              ground-based detector, and (2) to begin work on GLAST, which is a satellite
              detector expected to be launched in 2005 that is designed to be 50 times as
              sensitive as the previous EGRET detector.  The Milagro detector became
              operational in October 1998.  The Cerenkov detector will be useful both to
              calibrate the energy and angular resolution of Milagro and to measure the
              cosmic-ray composition.  Dr. Dingus is also interested in planning and testing
              the GLAST design, in particular regarding gamma-ray bursts which impact all
              subsystems due to their extremely bright intensity, thus tightening the
              requirements on instrument dead-time while reducing the requirements on
              background rejection.
