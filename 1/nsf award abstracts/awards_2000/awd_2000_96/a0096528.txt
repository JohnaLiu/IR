Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to partially support the Fifth North American Meeting
              of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability, sponsored by the Institute of
              Mathematical Statistics. The primary objective is to provide a venue for
              interaction among new researchers in statistics and probability. The conference
              will take place from July 31 - August 3, 2001, on the Georgia Institute of
              Technology campus in Atlanta, Georgia, just prior to the annual Joint
              Statistical Meetings to be held in Atlanta. Participants will include
              approximately 50 statisticians and probabilists who have received their Ph.D.
              within 5 years of the conference or who expect to receive their Ph.D. within 1
              year of the conference. Presentations by 4 senior speakers and roundtable
              discussions on the processes of publishing and grant funding (with participants
              from NSA, NSF, ONR, and NIH) are also part of the schedule.
