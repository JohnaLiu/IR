Abstract    :
              9809319  Cole    This ESH project will analyze the stable oxygen and isotopes 
              in corals recently collected from the Marquesas Islands to  produce the first
              multi-century, precisely-dated subseasonal  record from the core ENSO region. 
              The isotopic data will be  combined with analyses of trace metals by French
              colleagues  and used to infer temperature variations.  These data will 
              contribute to understanding the log-term variability of  ENSO, including any
              recent changes resulting from  anthropogenic effects, and the interplay between
              decal and  interannual Pacific climate modes.
