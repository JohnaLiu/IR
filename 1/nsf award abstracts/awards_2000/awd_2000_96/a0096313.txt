Abstract    :
                      9723592  DellaPenna  Carotenoids are integral components of plant
              photosystems and their compositions in photosynthetic membranes is remarkably
              conserved. In order to increase our understanding of carotenoid synthesis and
              function in plants, the work uses a molecular approach in Arabidopsis to define
              and disrupt the pathway and thereby modify carotenoid production in vivo. Two
              loci, responsible for the synthesis of lutein have been identified. In a
              comparison between wild type and mutant lines, the work will characterize the
              production and accumulation of carotenoids during growth and development, in
              response to various environmental perturbations, monitor pigment/ protein
              complex structure and composition, and measure the effect of altered pigment
              composition on photosynthetic parameters.
