              ABSTRACT
AST-0096913


This program is to build and use an interferometric
              array of six 3.5m diameter radio telescopes to image the Sunyaev Zel'dovich
              (SZ) effect in clusters of galaxies.  The array will be used to provide a new
              view of cosmic structure formation at high redshifts by taking a complete,
              redshift-independent inventory of galaxy clusters.  It will obtain independent
              estimates of the Hubble Constant H0, the deceleration parameter q0, and the
              cosmological matter density WM.  These measurements will then lead to
              independent constraints on the total energy density of the universe and the
              contribution from a cosmological constant. The new array, after its initial
              survey of clusters, will be used in conjunction with the Owens Valley
              Millimeter Array of six 10m antennas, and perhaps eventually as part of CARMA
              (Combined Array for Millimeter Astronomy), to form a heterogeneous array with
              many advantages for high spatial dynamic range imaging of general astronomical
              phenomena.  After the SZ measurements are completed the array will be made
              available to the US astronomical community.
