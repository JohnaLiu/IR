Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to develop sufficient structural and dynamic data
              on liposome-based and synthetic polymer-based vectors to permit the design of
              more efficient gene transfer agents. A theoretical model will be derived from
              the data which includes:
Phase diagrams of both carrier types identifying the
              equilibrium structures as a function of system parameters;
Examining possible
              non-equilibrium structures and the conditions for their formation; and
              
Relating the performance of the various carriers using structure/function
              relationships.
The ultimate goal of this proposal is to identify and quantify
              the fundamental processes controlling gene transfer via synthetic carriers.
