ABSTRACT

M. Feldman will work on three main topics. (1) Study of
              Monge-Kantorovich
mass transfer problem in nonhomogeneous media, which include
              transport
on manifolds with obstacles, and in anisotropic and nonsmooth
              spaces.
Also, related evolution problems will be studied. Recently a progress
              was 
made by many authors in studying mass transport in the Euclidean space.
              
Nonhomogeneous media is a natural next step. (2) Study of existence
              of
convex viscosity solutions of geometric evolution equations, including
              
nonlocal curvature motion, in the spatial dimensions three and higher. 
Such
              geometric evolutions are related to Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer. 
(3) Free
              boundary problems: existence and stability of solutions, and 
regularity of
              free boundaries.

Methods of mass transfer theory were used recently in
              several applications 
including mathematical models in economics, meteorology,
              fluid dynamics, 
sandpiles growth and collapse, non-Newtonian fluids,
              plasticity. Free 
boundaries and moving interfaces arise naturally in many
              models.
Mathematical analysis of such problems improves our understanding of
              
qualitative properties of models, and is a necessary ingredient in
              
developing of fast and reliable numerical algorithms. In addition,
              
mathematical study sometimes discovers unexpected connections between
              
different models (for example, partial differential equations and transport
              
problems), and such interplay is useful in applications.
