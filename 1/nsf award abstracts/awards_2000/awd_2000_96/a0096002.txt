Abstract    :
              9734908  Rong   This research project is aimed to develop a fundamental
              framework for automating dedicated fixture design based on the case-based
              reasoning technique.  A combination of parametric design and variation design
              techniques will be explored, in order to achieve the functions required in the
              automated generation of fixture structure geometry.  Geometric constraint
              analysis will be used for fixture design generation, and it will include both
              topological and dimensional constraints in the consideration.  Once the fixture
              is designed, fixturing performance will be evaluated to ensure the quality of
              fixture designs.  The research tasks include: (1) fixture design requirement
              representation, (2) fixture structure analysis and modeling, (3) fixture design
              case description and similarity identification, (4) automated fixture design
              case retrieval and modification, and (5) fixture design verifications,
              including geometric constraint and accessibility, fixturing accuracy and
              stability, fixturing stiffness, and interference-free verifications.   The
              project is important to automating dedicated fixture designs and to the
              integration of fixture design with CAD/CAM.  It may lead to a significant
              reduction of manufacturing lead time and an enhancement of rapid responding
              capability to product changes.
