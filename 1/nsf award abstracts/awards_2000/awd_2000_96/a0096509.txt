Abstract    :
              Funded under the guidelines for Local Systemic Change (LSC) through Teacher
              Enhancement, this five-year project is a collaboration among the School
              District of Lancaster (Pennsylvania), LaSalle University, and the Education
              Trust.  The project supports professional development and curricular
              implementation for 400 teachers of mathematics in grades K-12 and 30
              administrators, to meet the District's goal of having 
90% of students meet
              high mathematics standards by 2005.  Lancaster's LSC plan includes:  

1. 180
              hours of professional development for 400 mathematics/support teachers in
              implementing Everyday Mathematics in grades K-6, Impact in grades 7-8, and
              NSF-supported instructional materials (Interactive Mathematics Program,
              Core-Plus, or Math Connections) as the core for all mathematics students in
              grades 9-12.  

2. An additional 90 hours of staff support through modeling,
              coaching, and collaboration with internal and external mentors.

3. 150 hours
              of instructional leadership training for administrators and school-based
              mentors (Instructional Facilitators).

4. Community mathematics fora on
              supporting mathematics learning. 

School-based Instructional Facilitators
              (IF) provide daily support for teachers in improving teaching and learning
              through modeling, coaching and facilitating teacher collaboration.  Each of the
              District's thirteen elementary schools, four middle schools, one alternative
              secondary school, and one high school has at least one IF.  

In addition to
              the required LSC core evaluation, the project's evaluation includes a student
              achievement component:  (a) the Pennsylvania State Assessments measuring
              students' progress in mathematics at grades 5, 8, and 11; (b) the New Standards
              Reference Exam measuring students' progress in mathematics at grades 4, 7, and
              10; and (c) district-wide, 9-week assessments (performance-based tasks adopted
              and adapted from nationally recognized assessments, including Exemplars and
              Maryland State Assessments) measuring students' progress throughout the year in
              mathematics at grades 3, 5, 8, and 11.
