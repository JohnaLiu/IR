Abstract    :
              In this proposal the PIs and their collaborator at the University of Oklahoma
              propose to build, test, and conduct experiments with an experimental setup to
              measure flow of liquid through cracks in experimental materials. The cracks
              will consist of simple single cracks and also interconnected 3D crack networks.
              The solid matrix will consist of dried epoxy resin, silica glass and the fluid
              will be deionized and degassed distilled water with dye added. Some experiments
              will examine the effects of precipitation and dissolution of CaSO4 and other
              substances on flow through cracks and crack networks. The flow rates will be
              measured using camera techniques in a specially equipped lab. The results of
              these simple experiments will then be used to try to better understand the
              processes occurring in sea floor hydrothermal systems.
