Abstract    :
                  This project will undertake a statistical investigation of the  substorm
              expansion initiation and evolution utilizing the maximum  time resolution
              ground and space based observations available.  The  purpose of this
              investigation will be to document in detail the  average of substorms with
              great precision and to resolve  outstanding questions regarding the time
              sequence of substorm  phenomena.  Results of this project should allow substorm
              model  predictions to be evaluated and should also place significant 
              constraints on the models themselves.
