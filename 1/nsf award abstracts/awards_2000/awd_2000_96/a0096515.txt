Abstract    :
              A program of research in theoretical elementary particle physics will
include
              the study of the relation between quantum field theory in
three-dimensional
              space on the one hand, and gravity and supergravity in
higher dimensions on
              the other hand. Quantum field theory describes such
phenomena as the strong
              nuclear forces. Supergravity is a limiting case of
the string theory that may
              unify all of the forces of nature, including
gravity. It has been shown that
              the connection between quantum field
theory and gravity gives quantitative
              information about the properties of
field theory when forces between particles
              are very strong. This strong -
force information is required for many
              applications and is generally not
accessible by other methods.
