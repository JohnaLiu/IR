Abstract    :
                         9802109  Gramila    This condensed matter physics project
              investigates the influences  of disorder and correlation effects on electron
              systems. The  experiments depend on measurement of electron drag, which 
              directly determines electron-electron scattering rates between  closely spaced
              but electrically isolated two-dimensional (2D)  gases. The experiments will
              investigate the influence of atomic  disorder in the 2D planes on the
              electrical transport, and will  probe exchange and correlation effects via
              determination of the  spin polarization of 2D electrons subject to an in-plane
              magnetic  field. The research is unique in providing direct measurements of 
              parameters that can be directly compared with important  theoretical
              predictions for the behavior of electrons in low-  symmetry environments. The
              work will deepen our understanding of  disorder and correlation effects that
              are of fundamental  importance in the microelectronics and magnetism
              industries. The  work provides a valuable arena for training graduate students
              in  both advanced technology and fundamental physics.  %%%  This condensed
