The current status of nanoscale
              science and engineering research and development (R&D) was evaluated by the
              Interagency Working Group on Nanoscience, Engineering and Technology (IWGN) and
              after August 2000 by the NSTC's Subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering
              and Technology (NSET).  The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) was
              initiated in FY2001 and White House FY2002 budget request recommended increased
              funding for the field.  NNI has as its overall objective to assure that U.S.
              will fully benefit from the development of a new technology, and maintains or
              attains the capacity to be a leader or a competitive participant in all areas
              of nanoscale science, engineering and technology.  The National Research
              Council will compare the current state of the U.S. in this field to the state
              required to meet the NNI objective.  It will then consider whether the U.S.
              research portfolio in nanotechnology, as represented by the NNI, addresses
              those gaps which must be bridged to achieve this objective.  An interim
              letter-report will be prepared by October 15, 2001.
