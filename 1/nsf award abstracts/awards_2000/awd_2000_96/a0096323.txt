Abstract    :
              This collaborative proposal seeks support for a project to obtain and interpret
              ice-core records from the Tien Shan area of central Asia and to collect and
              analyze modern observational data from the area. Specifically, the project will
              obtain ice cores 200-250 m in length from the Inilcheck Glacier in the central
              Tien Shan and perform the analyses necessary to prove that these ice cores
              provide a detailed paleoclimatic record for the last 2000-300 years. Detailed
              meteorological, hydrological, and glaciological measurements will also be made
              and placed in the context of historical measurement in the area.
