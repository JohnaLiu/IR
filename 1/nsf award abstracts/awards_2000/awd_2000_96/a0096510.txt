Abstract    :
              In 1998 four large suflide structures were recovered from the Mothra
              hydrothermal field on the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  The
              four distinctly different samples to be examined in this study provide an
              opportunity to examine the phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of
              microorganisms within the environmental gradients that comprise a range of
              conditions in a mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal setting.  The
              mineralogical-chemical-microbiological gradients witin these samples will be
              thoroughly mapped and characterized.
