Description:  This award supports a US-India cooperative
              research project on Fundamental Studies of Nucleation and Crystal Growth of
              Zeolites and Hydrotalcites.  US PI Prabir K. Dutta, Ohio State University (OSU)
              and Raksh Vir Jasra, Central Salt & Marine Chemicals Research Institute
              (CSMCRI), Bhavnagar, India will study the synthesis of two classes of
              microporous materials, zeolites, and hydrotalcite-based layered double
              hydroxides (HT).  The objectives are to understand the factors leading to
              incomplete crystallization and/or formation of impurity phases in zeolite X
              systhesis systems, and to understand the crystallization dynamics of HT-like
              compounds.

Scope:  The research groups compliment one another and each group
              has highly qualified senior researchers with established research records.  For
              CSMCRI, microporous material synthesis is a key technology area and Dr. Jasra
              has extensive research experience in the area of zeolite synthesis.  OSU will
              focus on the fundamental structural aspects and identify the specific features
              that control the crystallization of zeolite X.  Their collaboration is expected
              to produce advances that increase scientific understanding of zeolites and
              hydrotalcites. The project has clear mutual benefits for the US and India, as
              well as potential for broad commercial application.  This award is jointly
              supported by the Division of International Programs and the Division of
              Materials Research.
