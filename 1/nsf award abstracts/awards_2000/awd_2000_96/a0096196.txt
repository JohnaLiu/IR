                Title:                  Enhanced Ultrafast X-ray Generation Using Pulse
              Shaping    In this research, precisely controlled ultrafast laser pulses will
              be used to enhance the process of coherent x-ray generation and thus
              demonstrate a practical source of x-rays with extremely short pulse duration. 
              Novel approaches for enhancing and controlling the efficiencies of soft x-ray
              generation will be attempted, for the first time, by engineering the
              wavefunction in a quantum system using appropriate waveforms.  The set-up will
              be the first of its kind and will have a great impact on the study of dynamic
              processes in molecules and wide-bandgap materials and also on microscopy and
              possibly lithography.  These areas are important to the national technology
              base for optics, ultrafast communications, sensors, microscopy and x-ray
              lithography.  Strong student involvement and relevant and multidisciplinary
              training for students is an integral part of this research.
