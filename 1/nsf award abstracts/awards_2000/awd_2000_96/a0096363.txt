Abstract    :
              Glass shards in ash layers from ODP cores show that the Marianas and Tonga arcs
              produced magmas with high B/Be simultaneously at 3-4Ma. High values of B/Be are
              thought to be due to a high proportion of slab-derived fluid. This proposal is
              to analyze more glass shards from new areas, Bonin and Japan, to determine
              whether this high B/Be is also present in these areas at 3-4 Ma. These new
              analyses will help determine whether the high B/Be signal is regional or local
              and also to evaluate the unlikely possibility that the high B/Be is secondary 
              (due to alteration). This study will also indirectly shed light on whether slab
              volatile flux is mostly controlled by convergence rate and not other factors
              like the type and amount of sediment that is being subducted.
