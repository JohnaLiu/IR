Abstract    :
                AST 98-02978  Andrew Connolly  Johns Hopkins University  Tracing the evolution
              of galaxies    Over the last few years the study of the evolution of galaxies
              has emerged as one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of observational
              astronomy.  We now see a rapid rise in the global comoving luminosity density
              (i.e., star formation rate) from a redshift of zero to a peak about z of 1.5. 
              At higher redshifts there appears to be a general decline in the star formation
              rate.  These are qualitative descriptions.      Dr. Connolly is quantifying how
              particular galaxy populations evolve.  He has a suite of statistical techniques
              for estimating the redshifts of galaxies from broadband photometry.  He expects
              to increase the number of galaxies with observed redshift from a few thousand
              to more than fifty thousand.  He will then trace the evolution of the galaxy
              luminosity function of spectral type and morphology.  Star formation activity
              in the redshift interval 1 < z < 2 is another missing piece of the evolutionary
              puzzle.  Dr. Connolly is undertaking an emission line survey with the Hubble
              Space Telescope to identify the Balmer line, H ( of hydrogen as well as OIII
              lines.  This will derive the first systematically selected sample of galaxies
              in this redshift range.  ***
