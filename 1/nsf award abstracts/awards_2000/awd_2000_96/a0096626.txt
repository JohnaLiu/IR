Harvey, Paul M.

Two hundred years ago scientists discovered that
              light from a point source diffracted around a sharp edge produced a fringe
              pattern. Later it was discovered that information about the spatial structure
              and spectral characteristics of the light across the pinhole was encoded in the
              structure of the fringe pattern.  Around the middle of the last century
              astronomers used the sharp edge of the moon as it passed over light from stars
              to learn about the nature of light from stellar surfaces.  The quality and
              quantity of scientific data recorded using these techniques was limited by the
              low responsiveness of the focal planes at the time. 

This new work will
              leverage new technology focal planes, and high-speed electronics, and improved
              computer controlled telescope-instrument systems into a new instrument designed
              and built to record fringe patterns created by lunar occultations of selected
              celestial objects. This instrument will make measurements in the infrared where
              different wavelengths between 1 and 13 micrometers can be used to achieve
              different spatial resolutions of the diameters of stars, search for binary
              stars and will have a role in reconstructing images of extended sources at
              different wavelengths. The instrument will be of significant value to educate
              students on optical diffraction and how it can be used to measure stellar
              diameters and limb darkening.
