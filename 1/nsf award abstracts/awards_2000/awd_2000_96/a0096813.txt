This award will supply shipboard scientific
              support equipment for the research vessels Melville, Revelle, New Horizon,
              Sproul operated by the University of California and dedicated to use in support
              of marine research.  The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
              conduct of ocean science research. The Program provides support for such items
              as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of
              scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
              earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
              for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
              motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
              sites.  The Project Director, Robert Knox is fully qualified to direct this
              project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and
              installation of shipboard equipment.  This project will allow the institution
              to acquire dynamic position system, gyro, Doppler Seed Log, back-up evaporator,
              fume hood, hazmat storage, and a workboat through a group purchase (no monetary
              award for this item to UCSD).  ***
