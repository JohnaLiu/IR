Abstract    :
              97-31350  Carlson      This project creates materials for professional
              development providers so they can enhance teachers' ability to facilitate
              inquiry science and track student learning progress at the elementary level. 
              It builds on a former project that used ongoing student assessment in a way
              that is congruent with instruction, monitoring student growth, and serving
              instruction.  Specifically, the project will design and pilot test a set of six
              to eight modules; conduct national field testing; and revise, publish and
              disseminate the materials.  The materials developed through this project will
              help professional development specialists work with teachers to assess student
              progress in science while fostering inquiry.  The approach will emphasize
              helping teachers ask open-ended questions, systematically listen to and observe
              students, and review children's work.  Diverse materials will be developed
              including notes, video taping, and audio taping. The National Science Education
              Standards will be the guide for all work conducted by this project.
