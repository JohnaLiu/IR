This professional materials development pilot project will
              develop materials to support the professional development needs of the
              NSF-supported middle school projects.  Project VITAL (Video Interactives for
              Teacher Analysis and Learning) will produce a pilot CD-ROM and accompanying
              print support materials to address teaching for mathematical understanding at
              the middle school level. 

The intent of the project is for teachers to
              watch, question, and reflect on video from classrooms implementing reform-based
              curricula, to examine student and teacher materials, and to "listen to and
              reflect with implementing teachers, students, parents, curriculum developers,
              and math educators."  Project partners include the Institute for Research on
              Learning, the Show-Me Center from the University of Missouri, EDC's K-12
              Mathematics Curriculum Center, MarshWorks, and Quality Evaluation Designs. 
              Other collaborators include the NSF-supported Middle School Mathematics
              curriculum projects, other projects, and local middle school teachers.
