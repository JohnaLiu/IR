Abstract    :
              William Miller of the University of California, Berkeley, is supported by the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop theoretical concepts
              and methodologies that can provide a quantitative description of chemical
              dynamics, a kind of  "ab initio chemical dynamics" akin to the ab initio
              quantum chemistry of electronic structure theory.  New applications of these
              approaches to specific chemical systems will be carried out to illustrate or
              demonstrate the new methods and concepts.  Computation of reactive flux
              correlation functions to give chemical reaction rates is a central topic for
              this effort, and exploration of processes in rare gas clusters using
              semiclassical (SC) initial value representation (IVR) approaches will continue.
               The overall goal is to cast the SC-IVR methodology in a form that will make it
              practical for virtually all systems for which classical molecular dynamics
              simulation is possible.

This research aims to explore the development of a
              potentially universal treatment of chemical dynamics, including the quantum
              mechanical effects that are important for very small particles.  This approach
              may improve the predictive capabilities for chemical processes that occur in
              solids and solutions, with resulting impact in important areas of chemistry,
              biology, and physics.
