This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
              Massachusetts provides instrumentation to significantly improve the
              oceanographic research capabilities of the research vessels Atlantis, Knorr and
              Oceanus, three ships operated by WHOI as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  Specifically, this award will
              provide new sensors for CTD operations on all three ships, a new Chirp
              echosounder system for R/V Atlantis, upgrades to the multibeam echosounders on
              R/V Knorr and Atlantis, spare parts for a lowered acoustic Doppler current
              profiler, a new marine magnetometer, and refurbishing of a winch for deploying
              and recovering deep ocean moorings.  These improvements will be of substantial
              advantage to marine scientists using these three ships in their research during
              2001 and future years.
