Abstract    :
              9725543  Lyons    Recent sediment flux work by Milliman and Syvitski (1992)
              suggest that rivers draining high-standing oceanic islands between Australia
              and Asia may contribute 50% of the total sediment flux to the oceans.  This
              material is likely to be transferred directly into the deep ocean due, in part,
              to the narrow coastal-shelf areas associated with the active margins
              surrounding these islands.  If this is true, terrestrial geochemical inputs to
              the ocean, and, hence, balances based on sediment measurements from larger
              river systems may be in error.  We have collected and analyzed riverine
              sediments from four river systems in New Zealand.  Our data indicate that these
              river sediments are depleted in Ba, Co, Cu, Hg, Mo, Ni, Zn and Pb and enriched
              in Sr, relative to marine clays.  Shele-normalized REE patterns show
              intermediate REE enrichments with positive Eu anomalies.  Our preliminary
              results indicate that these New Zealand sediments have different geochemical
              signatures than marine clastic sediments.     During the three years of support
              for the research, the PIs plan to collect 200 to 300 riverine particulate
              matter (RPM) samples from streams and rivers in New Zealand.  These samples
              will be analyzed, using state-of-the-art techniques in order to establish if
              the RPM geochemical flux to the oceans from these high-standing islands are
              different than from the major riverine flux established by Martin and Meybeck
              (1979).  If they are, new flux calculations will be undertaken in order to
              better quantify the importance of RPM on marine geochemistry.  In addition,
              samples will be collected from watersheds of similar geology and climate but of
              different area and sediment yield in order to evaluate the importance of
              storage on the RPM geochemistry.  In Year 2, samples from watersheds of
              differing geology but similar climate will be compared in order to establish
              the linkage between bedrock types and RPM chemistry.  All this work will be
              done in close cooperation with colleagues at the National  Institute for Water
              and Atmospheric Research Ltd. in Christchurch, New Zealand.
