Abstract    :
              This project will examine the public's view of police abuse and just punishment
              in the context of the range of settings that typify complex day-to-day
              encounters between officers and citizens. Two goals describe this research: (1)
              to establish empirically the dimensions that define police abuse of authority
              and, following this, just punishment for abusive behavior in the eyes of the
              public; and (2) to explain under which circumstances structural (i.e., social
              status), experiential (i.e., prior experience with the police and the criminal
              justice system), or attitudinal (i.e., socio-political values) factors
              contribute to an understanding of citizens' judgments of police abuse and just
              punishment. These topics will be examined with data obtained from a telephone
              survey undertaken with a random sample of 1100 respondents in the City of New
              York. The sampling frame is designed to insure statistically reliable
              comparisons across ethnic groups in the City, including whites,
              African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. Also, by using vignettes, the survey
              instrument will explain empirically whether and to what extent respondents
              share a common, normative understanding of the boundaries, the seriousness and
              the thresholds of police abuse and, following this, just punishment. Building
              on studies of the public's perception of police practices as well as studies of
              policing, this study of the normative structure of police abuse and just
              punishment will make a significant contribution to an understanding of the
              legitimacy of the police in the eyes of the public.
