Abstract    :
              Dr. Katharine Covert, Department of Chemistry, West Virginia University,  
              Morgantown, West Virginia, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,   and
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division and by the   Experimental
              Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) for   studies of the
              synthesis of antimony allyls and oxo-allyls.  A class of   antimony allyls with
              sterically demanding alkoxides will be prepared.    Oxidition and transfer
              studies of the allyl fragments with molybdenum,   tin, and vanadium will be
              performed. Dr. Covert's group will also   synthesize and resolve chiral
              antimony allyls, and they will survey their   reactivity in allyl transfer and
              oxidation reactions.  The education   component of this project concentrates on
              large general chemistry courses   with a focus on student retention and
              development, and takes advantage of   the synergism between research and
              teaching.  This project addresses the synthesis of a series of antimony
              complexes   containing both a reactive organic fragment, known as an allyl, and
              a   series of bulky substituents, known as alkoxides. The combination of  
              these bulky substituents with antimony provide the opportunity to control   the
              reactivity of the allyl fragment, and to understand commercial   processes
              which utilize antimony catalysts to perform the oxidation of   small organic
              molecules such as propene and propane.  Fundamental studies   of the synthesis
              of these compounds and the oxidation and transfer of the   allyl fragments will
              be performed.
