Abstract    :
              The New York Botanical Garden Herbarium houses the largest collection of
              bryophyte specimens in the Western Hemisphere and is among the five largest
              bryophyte herbaria in the world.  Since the inception of the institution in the
              late 1800's the focus of the institution has been on the flora of the Americas,
              and the bryophyte herbarium has unequalled depth in both historical and modern
              bryophyte collections.  The NYBG herbarium has served as a major resource for
              all the major floristic treatments on American bryophytes published in this
              century.

The project will catalogue and publish data from the 120,000
              specimens of bryophytes from Central America, Mexico and the West Indies.  The
              data made available as a result of this project will expedite research on
              bryophytes in these taxonomically and phytogeographically critical regions. 
              When overlaid with data sets from other groups of organisms, the data compiled
              in the course of this project will deepen our understanding of the biodiversity
              of the areas covered.  Specimen and authority records created in the course of
              this project will be made available in several ways to augment other specimen
              cataloguing endeavors.
