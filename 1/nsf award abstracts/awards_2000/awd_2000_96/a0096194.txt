Abstract    :
                It is particularly important to incorporate hands-on experience into
              introductory science courses for nonscience majors. Science is often perceived
              as a collection of facts rather than as an ongoing process of exploration. It
              is imperative that students have the opportunity to do science. It is difficult
              to include such firsthand experience in the large lecture classes typical of
              major universities. However, the problem can be successfully remedied in
              introductory astronomy courses by developing interactive laboratories for the
              World Wide Web. Most students can perform the labs in their dorms, the
              remainder in public computing areas on campus. Students desiring help can go to
              a computer-equipped tutorial room, staffed by teaching assistants.    This
              project is developing labs based on public domain images, rather than on
              simulations. Standard Web browser features will be combined with custom
              programs to turn static images into an interactive environment. Students will
              be able to blink, magnify and process images, and also make measurements.   
              Students will learn how the spectacular images on the evening news are used by
              professional scientists to attack critical astronomical questions. They will
              discover for themselves the strengths and limitations of a variety of
              telescopes and instruments. While rigorous, the labs will be designed to be
              fun. Exploration and creative thinking will be strongly encouraged. Results and
              feedback from a test lab made it clear that Web labs work!    The labs will be
              freely available on-line. Other institutions may either run them remotely, or
              install them on local Web servers.
