Abstract    :
              9800482  Lin  A GOALI award supports a collaborative study of the behavior  of
              pico read/write heads in magnetic storage systems as they  are in gliding
              contact with the moving disk.  The project  involves design and fabrication of
              micro-electromechanical  force and strain sensors to monitor the contacts, 
              development of a rigorous slider model and suitable  algorithms that allow
              reconstruction of contact forces from  experimental results, and the conduct of
              field tests for  validation of the model and the algorithms.  In this 
              collaborative study, the University of Michigan will be  primarily responsible
              for the sensor development, the  University of Washington for development of
              model and  algorithms, and Seagate Technology Corporation will help  calibrate
              the sensors and conduct the field tests.  ***
