Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to gain support to significantly enhance an
              interdisciplinary Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) technology teacher
              education facility for both pre- and in-service teacher preparation at the
              University of Missouri-Columbia. This will result in a model laboratory, unique
              in Missouri, for preparing secondary-level Technology Education teachers to
              work within an interdisciplinary environment. Additionally, the laboratory will
              be utilized by students throughout the College of Education, with specific
              emphasis given to science and mathematics education as well as students from
              the Industrial and Mechanical & Aerospace engineering departments. To insure
              this broadscale integration and use, the specifications for this laboratory
              were developed jointly by faculty from technology education, science,
              mathematics education, and engineering.    Wide-spread national calls for
              Technology Education and the integration of math/science/technology necessitate
              the development of a facility for thematic exploration and study. This facility
              will be the primary show place in the region for this new kind of learning,
              significantly enhancing undergraduate education in Missouri, and setting a
              standard for the midwest. A comprehensive undergraduate program in Technology
              Education has been approved by the University and is in place. The most
              significant barrier to full implementation of the program is a lack of
              state-of-the-art equipment necessary to deliver the program. The equipment
              listed in this proposal has been carefully selected to provide a solid
              foundation for preparing teachers for the 21 st century.
