              Abstract    Proposal No:  9805385           Proposal Type:  Investigator
              Initiated   Principal Investigator:  Charles Martin  Affiliation:  Colorado
              State University    This grant is awarded through the Separations and
              Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations
              Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal
              investigator is Dr. Charles Martin at Colorado State University. The project
              addresses the development of nanotubule based molecular recognition membranes.
              Such membranes are developed by chemically functionalizing the pores of
              nanostructured membranes to introduce the molecular recognition aspect. In
              addition, the research seeks to develop methods to control pore size by
              adjustment of the structures of the chemical functionalities on the pore walls.
              The research will also seek to impart a molecular imprinting aspect to the
              functionalized pore structure.     Molecular recognition membranes could
              revolutionize separations technology, particularly in the biotechnology and
              pharmaceutical industries. These  concepts offer the promise of highly
              selective separations that can be carried out with lower energy utilization.
              Chiral separations is one example of potential technology development that
              could result from this research and have a tremendous impact on the
              pharmaceutical industry.
