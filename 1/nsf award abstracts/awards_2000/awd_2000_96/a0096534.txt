Abstract    :
              The investigators will study magnetic impulse events (MIE) in the dayside
              magnetosphere.  MIE events are signatures of plasma entry into the
              magnetosphere.  The study will make use of ground- and space-based data, which
              will be combined with theoretical models to isolate the most important
              mechanisms responsible for these processes.  In the first year, the
              investigators will identify the factors controlling the motion of MIE seen in
              high latitude ground magnetograms and discriminate between proposed
              interpretations in terms of bursty merging, pressure pulses, and the
              Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.  During the second year, they will investigate
              the nature of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling by comparing geosynchronous and
              ground signatures with the predictions of several recent proposed coupling
              models.  In the third year, they will undertake a survey of dayside auroral
              brightenings seen by satellite imagers, determine their occurrence patterns as
              a function of solar wind conditions, and establish their relationship to
              previously reported categories of transient events seen in high latitude ground
              observations.  Understanding MIE is important for identify the factors that
              control solar wind entry in the magnetosphere and its subsequent effects on
              Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere and space weather.
