Abstract    :
              9614178  Sparks    Komatiite lavas, with extremely high eruption temperature
              provide unique information about the Archean mantle.  Simple models of the
              major element compositions of Archean komatiites indicate melting at very high
              temperatures and pressures (potential temperatures greater than 1800C and 
              depths of at least 250 km), but the dynamics of  upwelling, melting and melt
              extraction in these areas of the mantle are not understood.  The PI proposes to
              integrate a numerical model of mantle convection and melting with
              parameterizations of melt compositions from high pressure melting experiments. 
              These models will be used to systematically explore the effects of poorly
              constrained properties of and conditions in the Archean mantle (temperature,
              composition, viscosity, melt migration permeability, lithospheric thickness) on
              the major and trace element composition of the melts that are produced.  The
              compositions of ultramafics and other Archean rocks will be used to constrain
              the hypotheses and assumptions of the models.  A flexible and efficient model
              that can determine the dependencies and interactions between the fluid dynamics
              and chemistry of mantle melting will provide both insight into the dynamics of
              the Archean mantle and guidance in setting the priorities of future
              experimental programs.
