Abstract    :
              Professor Bergmeier's research explores cyclization reactions brought about by
              the intramolecular reaction of an allylsilane and an aziridine.  The reaction
              will yield either a carbocyclic homoallylic amine or a fused bicyclic
              pyrrolidine, depending on the conditions that are selected.  Further study will
              determine the extent of stereoselectivity in the reaction and identify those
              factors that can be altered to control its stereochemistry.  The formal [3+2]
              cyclization will be expanded upon to provide the means of preparing multiple
              polycyclic molecules. Finally, natural product synthesis will be undertaken
              where it may be advantageous to establish the utility of the synthetic methods
              as they are refined.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Stephen C. Bergmeier of
              the Ohio State University.  Professor Bergmeier studies chemical reactions that
              enable the creation of different molecules from a single precursor.  A wide
              variety of naturally occuring compounds as well as synthetic pharmaceutical
              molecules have been identified for which Bergmeier's chemistry would provide
              easy access.
