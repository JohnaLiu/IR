The NSFCAM, an infrared imaging system developed over
              10 years ago for use at the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) will be upgraded
              to accommodate the improved image quality now given by the telescope when the
              adaptive optics system is in use and also accommodate new infrared focal plane
              technology developments.  The adaptive optics system enables diffraction
              limited performance of the telescope, which is a spatial gain in resolution of
              a factor of about 8 better than without A/O.   The current focal plane is a 256
              by 256 InSb array.  The new array will be a 1024 x 1024 pixel assembly. 
              Upgrades to the current very successful system include: a new array controller,
              new lens tubes to provide new pixel scales of 0.04 and 0.08 arcseconds per
              pixel, a dedicated wavefront sensor for NSFCAM, and a new 1024 x 1024 science
              grade focal plane that is provided to the project through funds from another
              source. The instrument includes a Grism and a circular variable filter and a
              polarimeter which enable spectro-polarimetric imaging at selected spectral
              bands between 1 and 5 micrometer wavelengths.   Science planned includes AO
              observations of extended sources such as planets, comets star clusters,
              star-forming regions, the Galactic Center, active galactic nuclei), as well as
              observations at higher spatial resolution across smaller fields for
              circumstellar disks, faint companions to near-by stars, and debris disks around
              stars.
