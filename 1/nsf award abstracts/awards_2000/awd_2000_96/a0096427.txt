Abstract    :
              Summary:  The objective of this study is to investigate temporal relationships
              between changes in the Agulhas Current, fluctuations of NADW and sea surface
              temperature through the last interglacial (MIS 5), to establish timing between
              deep and surface water changes.  The study will also produce regional maps of
              surface and deep water proxy indicators for the Holocene and the last glacial
              maximum to establish the spatial differences during these climate extremes.
