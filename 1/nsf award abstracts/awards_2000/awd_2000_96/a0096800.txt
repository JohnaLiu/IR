Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks a new approach to the problem of improving spatial coherency
              in
large volume laser sources, and of coherent combination of the outputs of
              several lasers.
This approach is based on using guided mode grating
              resonances. A fundamental aspect
of this project is the study of mode
              competition in a laser resonator that contains a new
element: a waveguide
              grating mirror. This approach is applicable to different kinds of
lasers, but
              it is most advantageous in the case of semiconductor lasers.

We expect to
              improve brightness and high-power semiconductor lasers by a factor
of 60 to
              100. Potential applications include semiconductor pump lasers, industrial
              lasers
for cutting and welding, lidars, and vertical cavity surface emitting
              lasers.
