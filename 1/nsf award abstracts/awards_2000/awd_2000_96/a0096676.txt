Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to synthesize, characterize, and measure the
              physical properties of solid-state metal chalcogenides (a chalcogenide being a
              compound that contains sulfur, selenium, or tellurium). Metal chalcogenides
              show a very rich chemistry that is fundamentally different and much less
              explored than that of the oxides.  Areas to be explored include ternary
              transition-metal/rare-earth-metal/chalcogenides, chalcogenide substitutional
              chemistry, rare-earth oxychalcogenides, rare-earth/copper/telluride derivatives
              and thermoelectric behavior, and thorium and uranium chalcogenides.
              Characterization of the new materials will include structural determinations by
              single-crystal X-ray methods and the measurement of physical properties to
              include electrical conductivity, thermopower, and magnetic susceptibility. The
              ultimate goal of this research project is to make the chemistry of solid-state
              materials more predictable.
%%%
The synthesis of new classes of solid-state
              materials exhibiting novel physical properties such as electronic, optical,
              thermoelectric, and magnetic together with correlating these physical
              properties with composition and structure are priority areas of high interest
              to industry, and students trained in these areas are very competitive in the
              job market.
