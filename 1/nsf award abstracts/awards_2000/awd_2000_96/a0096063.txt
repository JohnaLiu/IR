This research
              project will develop and test a radiative transfer model that will allow
              examination of the effects of increased ultraviolet (UV) light on the ecosystem
              of the Arctic Ocean.  The increased UV could result from continued thinning of
              the ozone layer and result in harmful effects on the ecosystem.  The long-term
              effect could be to reduce the biologic productivity on the shallow continental
              shelf and affect the transfer of carbon from shelf to basin.  The results of
              this project will provide input for planning a large Phase 2 field program of
              the Shelf Basin Interactions project in 2002.
