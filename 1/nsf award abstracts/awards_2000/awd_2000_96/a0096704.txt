Abstract    :
              
Soft magnetic films with low coercivity and high permeability are critical
              building blocks in numerous electromagnetic devices such as magnetic recording
              heads, integrated inductors (microinductors), integrated transformers, magnetic
              sensors, and micromachined motors.  However, a lack of soft magnetic materials
              with a high saturation magnetization (>20 kG), a large permeability (>1000),
              and a large ferromagnetic resonance frequency (>1 GHz), tends to be the
              bottleneck in these applications. For example, the data rate of hard disk
              drives is expected to be ~1 Gb/s      (1 Gb = 1 billion bits) by year 2003. A
              data rate of 2 Gb/s corresponds to a recording frequencies of ~1 GHz, which
              exceeds the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency of most magnetic materials.
              Therefore, it is increasingly urgent to investigate new materials,
              magnetization dynamics, and recording physics which will enable magnetic
              recording at a frequency of >1 GHz. In this project, we propose the following:
              1) Investigate a new soft magnetic material, namely Fe-Co-N films (FeCoN) with
              a saturation magnetization of ~24 kG, which will enable higher areal recording
              densities in hard disk drives (>100 Gb per square inch).  2) Study
              magnetization dynamics and magnetic recording at >1 GHz, an important milestone
              if reduced to practice. 3) Evaluate the viability of the new FeCoN material for
              integrated inductors, which are desired for emerging applications such as
              portable wireless communication devices. 4) Educate graduate students and
              undergraduates about information storage technology via doctoral thesis
              research, research experience for under graduate (REU), and classroom teaching.
