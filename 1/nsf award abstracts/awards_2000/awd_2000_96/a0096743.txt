Abstract    :
              The Ornithology collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences has one of the
              largest and most complete series of Andean birds in the world, and includes
              specimens of special historical interest such as many collected by Alexander
              Wilson, John James Audubon, and John Gould.  The collections also include over
              10,500 frozen tissue samples.  This project is to replace many old, warped
              cabinets with new ones to increase protection of this valuable collection from
              pest infestations, dust, and light.  It will also provide a new ultra-cold
              freezer for the tissue collection, which is stored now in a freezer shared with
              other departments. The collections are presently seriously overcrowded, with no
              expansion space available.  The new cabinets and freezer will relieve this.
