Abstract    :
              This research is on the design and implementation of ordered binary decision 
              diagram (OBDD) variable ordering and reordering methods.  The work explores the
               use of memory-efficient data structures, called Decision Diagrams (DD), to 
              describe the behavior of Boolean functions.  Being developed is a methodology
              for  finding an ordering of the Boolean function variables so that the DD has
              minimal  size.  This research exploits the use of conditional probabilities for
              the  purposes of variable ordering and dynamic reordering.  Efficient
              techniques for  computation of the spectrum of a Boolean function using its
              OBDD representation  as input are being used.  Software is being developed to
              manipulate OBDDs as well  as compute the probability values.
