Abstract    :
              


The use of databases in herbarium management has become a vital tool in
              the organization and analysis of large collections.  First the proposal focuses
              on completing a database for the ASU lichen herbarium comprising c. 105,000
              records, of which approximately half are currently databased.  A large fraction
              of these ASU collections (c. 30,000) are relevant to the greater Sonoran Desert
              Lichen Flora Project, which involves over 60 collaborators from 15 countries. 
              Most of these collaborators have participated on one or more of the 16 major
              field expeditions conducted over the past 12 years and have accumulated an
              additional c. 70,000 collections. A second major objective is to database these
              records and add them to the 30,000 subset from the first database thereby
              creating a second database specific to the Sonoran Desert Lichen Flora of c.
              100,000 records.  In addition to being able to access these two databases
              through the lichenological community (as is currently available through our
              homepage http://mgd.nacse.org/Arizona - and its links), the databases will be
              accessible to a much larger community (LTER and ASU scientists, K-12
              educational community, resource managers and conservationists) through an
              ongoing ASU database project entitled "Networking our Research Legacy" and
              administered by the ASU Center for Environmental Studies. Once constructed the
              databases will be maintained as part o the long-term database activities at the
              ASU LTER site.
