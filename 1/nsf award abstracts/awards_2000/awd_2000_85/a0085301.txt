The Role of Input Energy in Assessing Seismic Hazard and
              Damage following the 1999 Turkey Earthquakes

The main focus of this study is
              to examine the extent of correlation of energy-based descriptors of ground
              motion with the observed spatial distribution of damage during the recent 1999
              earthquakes in Turkey.  Of secondary interest is a comparison between more
              conventional strength-based descriptors (such as spectral acceleration) and
              these energy-based descriptors.

Probabilistic seismic hazard analyses will
              be performed using both of these frequency-dependent ground motion parameters. 
              Revised attenuation models including data from the recent earthquakes (with
              emphasis on recorded near-fault motions) will enhance the current database and
              reduce uncertainty in hazard estimates.  Whenever soil profile information is
              available, attempts will be made to include site effects in the hazard
              estimates.

Damage data for short-period industrial structures and for
              residential and office buildings will be collected from various regions and
              will also be correlated spatially with input energy and spectral acceleration
              demands.

Products of this study will include new predictive attenuation
              models as well as an understanding of the importance of energy-based ground
              motion descriptors and of the role of site effects on seismic hazard and on
              damage to short- and long-period structures.
