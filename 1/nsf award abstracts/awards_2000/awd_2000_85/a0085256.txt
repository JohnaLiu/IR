ABSTRACT


The proposed work is a collaborative research project on
              the seismic behavior of potable water systems with particular emphasis on
              buried pipe. The project has two specific goals.  The first is to fully and
              properly document the behavior of buried pipeline and other water system
              components in the affected areas of Turkey and Taiwan during the earthquakes in
              1999.  The second goal is to investigate the behavior of large diameter water
              pipe subject to the fault rupture hazard. 

In terms of the first goal, the
              data gathering and subsequent analysis will be directed at establishing
              fragility relations based upon key engineering parameters and mechanics, as
              opposed to simply a statistical analysis of empirical observations.

The
              earthquakes in Turkey and Taiwan provide a unique opportunity to develop a
              fundamental understanding of the behavior of large diameter pipe subject to the
              fault rupture hazard.  In both events, large diameter water pipe were severely
              damaged where they transversed the surface expression of a fault  The
              opportunity is unique in the sense that surface faulting has not intersected
              large diameter pipe in past events.  We plan to develop a fundamental
              understanding of this hazard by comparing the results of computer simulation
              and small scale laboratory modeling using the Rensselaer Geotechnical
              Centrifuge `with observed full scale behavior.
