Title: Information
              Technology Research: Learning-Centered Design Methodolodgy: Meeting the
              Nation's Need for Computational Tools for K-12 Science Education (Engineering
              Scaffolded Work Environments)

Learning while working in the knowledge-work
              professions can be supported
by appropriately-designed "scaffolded work
              environments (SWEets)."  Several
researchers have assembled a unique team of
              10 senior researchers from four
major universities to develop a principled
              engineering process for
constructing SWEets.  The work will be based in the
              knowledge work context
of "science inquiry" using an engineering process to
              construct SWEets for
fourth through eleventh graders learning science via
              scientific
investigations in Detroit and Chicago classrooms.  The results of
              the
proposed research will be explicit guidelines on how to build
              effective,
computationally-based work environments that scaffold and
              support
individuals engaged in knowledge work.  The aim of this effort is
              to
transform what presently appears to be the art into a principled,
              software
engineering approach.
