ABSTRACT

Recent seismic failures of bridges indicate or allude
              to inadequacy of today's US design code, including that (1) near field effects
              are not well understood and not covered, and (2) involved uncertainties are not
              explicitly addressed.  These issues even will not be systematically addressed
              in the new AASHTO LRFD seismic design code under development, due to lack of
              knowledge and field performance data.  The 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan
              offers an opportunity to improve the knowledge in these aspects.

This
              research project's objective is to develop a web-based comprehensive data
              library containing information on bridge behavior/performance and ground motion
              in the Chi-Chi earthquake, with an emphasis on near field effects.  The project
              will also include a preliminary study on these effects.  The research objective
              is to be reached by fulfilling the following tasks. (1) Review the latest
              developments in relevant areas. (2) If warranted based on Task 1, immediately
              visit Taiwan to collect time-sensitive data that are likely to be destroyed
              soon. (3) Develop a detailed plan and structure for the data library.  (4)
              Collect detailed field data.  (5) Conduct a preliminary study on near field
              effects.  (6) Develop the data library and post it on the World Wide Web.  (7)
              Prepare a final report.

Useful applications of the data library may include,
              but certainly not limited to, the following. 1) Calibrating numerical models
              for predicting seismic behavior and performance of bridges, particularly for
              including near field effects. 2) Calibrating performance based design codes for
              consistent reliability of bridge performance.  3) Comparison with other
              earthquakes for developing prediction models for ground motion and response
              spectra.  4) Educating engineering students and practicing engineers about
              earthquake engineering and bridge engineering.
