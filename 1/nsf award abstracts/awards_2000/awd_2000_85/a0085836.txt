Abstract    :
               Modern statistical learning approaches are expected to play a key role in
              providing more powerful tools to harvest information from bits, a crucial and
              growing problem for the Internet. The goal of this project is thus to develop a
              new technology for the management, organization, and search of multimedia
              digital information by exploiting and extending new statistical learning
              theories and algorithms. In the process we expect to prototype key system
              components and to develop scientific insights. Anticipated outcomes of the
              research are (1) new learning algorithms and associated representations that
              can be applied to categorize text, images, and video, (2) new theoretical
              analyses of these learning algorithms and query-answering methods and (3)
              demonstrations and evaluations of prototype systems for classifying and routing
              email messages and searching, categorizing, and extracting information on the
              Web.

Smarter classification software for multimedia data is a prerequisite
              to enable a second, more intelligent wave of Internet technologies. Automatic
              techniques to route, organize and search information are needed to help
              individuals and organizations exploit the sea of data that the computer
              networks are creating. The success of projects like this will make such a step
              possible and accelerate the evolution of the Internet.
