Abstract    :
              0085739
The project will:
* Estimate and predict travel times between any two
              points and the corresponding shortest path;
* Calibrate the PARAMICS and
              possibly, CORSIM, micro-simulation models;
* Develop and evaluate a ramp
              metering policy based on the calibrate model.

The primary sources of data
              consist of data from Orange County and  Los Angeles County. The
Communication
              and database infrastructure for collecting, storing and processing data is in
              place and operational.

The simulation models will be calibrated with data
              from the two counties. The ramp metering policies will be tested and evaluated
              through simulation. The most promising strategies will be selected for field
              implementation.

This research effort will be devoted to network state
              estimation and prediction algorithms, calibration of simulation models, and
              design/evaluation of ramp-metering algorithms.
