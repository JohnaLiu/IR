This Small Grant for Exploratory Research project proposes a
              study of design microworlds and their integration in the process of
              collaborative design efforts. Identifying reusable assets for design; exploring
              design perspectives as if on a voyage of discovery; designing products and
              processes concurrently within an enterprise; effectively managing design
              knowledge, abstractions and freedom within the collaborative design process;
              creating a framework for automated, distributed design; and establishing a new
              approach to engineering design pedagogy are the principle issues to be
              explored. Theoretically, the effort proposes to integrate living systems
              theory, working principles and working. The intended deliverable is a full
              formal proposal to develop the foundational principles for designing
              microworlds that support human reasoning and judgment in an information-driven,
              distributed, engineering-related enterprise.
