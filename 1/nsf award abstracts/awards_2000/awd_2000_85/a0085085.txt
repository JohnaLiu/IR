The Principal Investigators
              will be funded for two years to develop techniques for inserting instrumented
              probes into several meters of actively deforming till under the Black Rapids
              Glacier in Alaska. Recent observations have identified a four to seven meter
              till layer under the most active part of the Glacier, and that almost
              two-thirds of the surface motion of the glacier is due to processes acting in
              the bottom few meters of the till.  There is negligible sliding at the ice-till
              interface.  Till has been observed under other glaciers, and in many of them,
              it may affect their flow pattern. Therefore, it is important to develop a
              method for studying the flow of thick, active till.  The Principal
              Investigators will drill to the to the top of the till using a hot-water drill
              and then drive the probes into the till with a heavy down-hole hammer and
              receive data without the use of wires.   At the present time, there is no
              adequate way to investigate the behavior of tills in situ under thick, rapidly
              moving ice.   This research effort would develop the means to make these
              essential measurements.
