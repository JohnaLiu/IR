Abstract    :
              An NSF/CBMS Regional Conference on Using Spectral Data to Solve Inverse Problems
              will be held at the University of Texas - Pan American. The dates for the
              conference are December 14-18, 2001. Professor Joyce McLaughlin, the Ford
              Foundation Professor of Mathematics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, will
              provide ten lectures as the conference Principal Lecturer.

The lectures will
              provide a self-contained and comprehensive exposition on the use of spectral
              data to solve inverse problems. In these problems, indirect measurements are
              used to determine material properties of objects.  For the set of problems to
              be presented, the data consists of natural frequencies and selected mode shape
              measurements. These lectures will present the newest methods for solving these
              problems, and give both mathematical and experimental insight into how the data
              depends on the material properties to be recovered. The main thrust for these
              lectures is for two-dimensional problems, with a brief introduction and insight
              given for one-dimensional problems. Demonstration experiments will be included
              to exhibit the response of vibrating systems at natural frequencies, to show
              the change in the response as material properties change, and to show geometric
              properties of selected mode shape data. A select number of
additional lectures
              will be provided by applied mathematicians and scientists addressing related
              inverse problems, in some cases where spectral data is utilized in other
              contexts.
