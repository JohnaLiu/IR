Abstract    :
              This project will develop a formal, but practical information technology
              infrastructure to make government regulations more effectively available to the
              public. The topic area is hazardous waste management. Federal and California
              state environmental protection agencies will be engaged in the project. The
              infrastructure to be developed will include distributed data repositories, and
              also tools to locate, merge, compare, and analyze the information. Project
              phases are 1) textual storage, 2) semi-structured indexed storage, 3) means to
              resolve semantic ambiguities, 4) cross-referencing  appropriate for automated
              access from relevant legal documents, and 5) on-line compliance checking of
              government regulations. This is an interdisciplinary project with the
              involvement of experts in law, computer science, and civil/environmental
              engineering.
