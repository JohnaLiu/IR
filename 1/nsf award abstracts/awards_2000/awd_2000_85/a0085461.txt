Abstract    :
              
The goal of this project is to understand and quantitatively predict the
              transport of small molecules through nanostructred material by an ab inito
              hierarchical approach.  This is being achieved by combining quantum mechanics
              with statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations to accurately
              predict thermodynamic solubilities and short-time tracer diffusivities in model
              nanostructred membranes.  Novel methods for predicting the nanostructure of
              NPCs is being developed and validated.  The information from this molecular
              modeling is being used within the context of generalized hydrodynamics and
              transition state theory to predict macroscopic permeability.  These predictions
              are then validated by comparison to ongoing experiments on supported nanoporous
              carbon membranes and supported polymer-inorganic membranes.  The results will
              provide a rational framework for designing nanostructred membranes to meet
              current and future challenges in separation science.
