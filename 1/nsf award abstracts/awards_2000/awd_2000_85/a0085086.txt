Abstract    :
              The Minneapolis Public Schools' Urban Systemic Program mission is to accelerate
              learning and expand opportunities so that all MPS children can achieve high
              standards in mathematics, science, and technology.  The Minneapolis/Minnesota
              Mathematics and Science-Technology Education Reform (MinnMASTER) will expand
              district-wide, standards-based, integrated instruction to all students in
              grades K-12 in mathematics, science, and technology resulting in improved
              student achievement in K-12 mathematics and science by all students. MPS
              defines high standards in terms of students meeting the requirements of the
              NCTM Mathematics Standards 2000, National Research Council Science Standards,
              Minnesota Profile of Learning, and the Minneapolis Public Schools' content
              grade level expectations.

The MPS-USP proposes to focus on the
              following:
1) Staff development for teachers in:
- Mathematics and science
              content;
- Meaningful integration of mathematics, science, and technology
              concepts and instruction;
- Pedagogy regarding mathematics, science, and
              technology instruction;
- Understanding how children think and learn
              mathematics and science;
- Assessment and examining student work; and
-
              Equity issues impacting learning in mathematics, science, and technology
              (including an emphasis on techniques for content teachers working with English
              Language Learners [ELL] to increase student's academic language base and deepen
              their cognitive thinking skills);
2) Staff development for administrators
              (referring to the above)
3) Alignment of assessments (both classroom and
              district-wide) to standards-based, best practices in mathematics, science, and
              technology; and
4) Community outreach regarding standards-based instruction in
              mathematics, science and technology.

MPS will utilize Teachers On Special
              Assignment (TOSA) as well as school-based lead teachers as a first-line
              mechanism for sustaining classroom teachers in their support of all students
              engaging and succeeding in a standards-based learning environment that will
              lead to improved student achievement on a number of student progress
              indices.
