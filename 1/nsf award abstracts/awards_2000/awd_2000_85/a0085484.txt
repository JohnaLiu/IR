"Understanding Decision-Making in Construction Engineering"


This
              award is for the support of an exploratory research project focused on
the
              decision-making process of current and future construction engineers
through
              pilot development and implementation of a virtual environment
called the
              "Construction Simulator."  This environment is created using a
Web-centric
              modular architecture and provides a platform on which different
"Scenario
              Developers" interact and collaborate with the environment.  As
each
              participant advances through the scenario, responses are captured and
used by
              a simulation engine to create outcomes.  The stored responses
constitute an
              automatic recording of detained performance data, which is
available for
              replay and analysis.

The research includes definition of the environment's
              framework, the
development of a simplified version of the Construction
              Simulator mark-up
Language (CSML), and the design and construction of
              simplified simulation
and visualization engines.  This award is made under the
              SGER (Small Grants
for Exploratory Research) program.  This preliminary study
              will determine
if the "Construction Simulator" has the potential to provide
              knowledge
about the decision making process of participants.  It will also
              determine
if the "Construction Simulator" has the potential to improve the
              process.
Development of the "Simulator" will involve participation
