Abstract    :
              The Pittburgh Supercomputer Center (PSC), a jointly supported venture of The
              University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University acting through the MPC
              Corporation, in collaboration with Westinghouse Electric Corporation, will put
              in place a 6 peak teraflop computing system for use by US researchers in all
              science and engineering disciplines.  The system will be provided by Compaq,
              based on a cluster of 686 4-processor Alpha 21264 based SMP nodes and Quadrics
              ELAN4 interconnects; it will have 2.7 terabytes of memory, 25 terabytes of
              local disk and 160 terabytes of global disk. The system will be deployed in two
              stages. The initial system will consist of ES40 systems with 16 nodes arriving
              in September 2000. In October the system will be upgraded to 64 nodes and be
              available in friendly user mode. This would form the basis of a relatively
              stable production environment for a modest number of users and will remain in
              service until the final system is completed in October 2001. Delivery of the
              final TCS system to PSC will begin in May although a 256-node test system will
              be available in December 2000 at Compaq. A 256-node system will be installed at
              PSC in June 2001 followed by a steady increase in size to about 618 nodes in
              September 2001. The conversion of the initial system to complete the final
              686-node system in October 2001. Allocations will be managed by the existing
              PACI National Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC).
