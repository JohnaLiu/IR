Abstract    :
              The Archimedes Project will create a testbed for developing and exploring model
              interactive  environments for the history of mechanics.  It will also serve as
              a proof-of-concept project for  open digital libraries for topics in the
              history of science designed to integrate research and  knowledge dissemination
              in new ways.  The project is a join endeavor of the Classics Department  at
              Harvard University, the Max-Planck-Institute for the History of Science (MPIWG)
              in Berlin,  Germany, the English Department at the University of Missouri at
              Kansas City, and the Perseus  Project at Tufts University.  It also engages
              wider network of scholars supported in particular by  Project International de
              Cooperation Scientifique (PICS).  Numerous treatises on mechanics as  well as
              other forms of documentation of mechanical knowledge and practices constitute
              the corpus of the testbed.  Ongoing research at the MPIWG on the long-term
              development of mental  models of mechanical thinking and their manifestation in
              technical terminologies, inferences of practitioners, engineers, and scientists
              plays an important role in the testbed design.  The testbed  also requires a
              powerful, linguistically based information technology for handling the variety
              of  languages occurring in the source materials.  Source documents must be
              prepared with tools  such as automatic morphological analysis of Latin, Greek
              and Italian, and semantic linking of  sources to general and technical,
              historical and modern dictionaries and reference works.
