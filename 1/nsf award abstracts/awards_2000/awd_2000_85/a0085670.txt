Abstract:

Over the next decade, highly scalable computer systems
              consisting of
hundreds or thousands of nodes will become necessary to meet
              the
demands of emerging global applications, such as Web and database
servers
              used for Internet commerce.  These applications must be
multithreaded to
              handle the thousands of simultaneous requests.  One
promising technology for
              this scalable server domain is the use of
multithreaded processors; for
              example, Compaq has announced
Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) support for
              its Alpha processor 
in the 2002/2003 time frame.

Unfortunately, no
              research has been conducted on multithreading
support for operating systems or
              on how to structure operating systems
for multithreaded CPUs.  Yet the OS may
              be crucial in this environment;
e.g., measurements show that a loaded web
              server can spend 75% of its
time in the OS.  The proposed research will
              develop the software
environment to complement the multithreaded hardware
              environment
provided by SMT and other fine-grained parallel processors. 
              The
research sits squarely between architecture and operating
              systems,
examining (1) the design and performance of multithreaded
              processors
to support OS needs, and (2) the structure of operating systems
              in
light of the capabilities of multithreaded processors.  The research
will
              focus on these questions in the domain of highly parallel,
request-driven
              workloads, such as Web servers and database servers.
