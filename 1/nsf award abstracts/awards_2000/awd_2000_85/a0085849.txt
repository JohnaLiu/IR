Abstract    :
              This project is developing a Digital Library Network for Engineering and
              Technology (DLNET), to facilitate the lifelong learning of engineering faculty,
              practicing engineers and technical professionals. Towards this end the project
              proposes to develop a content hosting platform, design standardized templates
              for posting new content, set up a process for electronic review and validation
              of new materials, and provide a portal through which content can be both posted
              and accessed. This portal is intended to provide the gateway to education and
              research materials published by universities and professional associations in
              the various engineering disciplines including the Institute of Electrical and
              Electronics Engineers (IEEE). It also provides the means to contribute new and
              relevant material efficiently and quickly.
