              ABSTRACT

Response of Precast Construction in Turkey during the 1999
              Earthquakes

The 1998 Turkish Seismic Code permits four types of precast
              construction:  moment-resisting frames, single-story hinged frames, structural
              wall panels, and combinations of precast moment-resisting frames with
              cast-in-place structural walls (solid or coupled).  Single-story hinged frames
              are used throughout Turkey for industrial facilities.  This type of structural
              system has not performed well in recent earthquakes, including the 1992 event
              in Erzincan, the 1998 event in Ceyhan, and the recent events near Izmit and
              Duzce.

Recent experience has shown that precast structures in the U.S. are
              also vulnerable to earthquake damage.  Parking structures were sustained damage
              at higher than anticipated levels during the 1994 Northridge earthquake.  Only
              after detailed evaluation of precast parking structures in the Los Angeles area
              were the causes of the damage identified.  Many factors that contributed to the
              observed response were not considered in the governing building codes.  

The
              goal of the proposed work is to collect detailed information about the
              structural configuration and connection details from damaged and undamaged
              precast buildings in the region of Turkey affected by the 17 August and 12
              November 1999 earthquakes.  Data collected will be evaluated with the goal of
              reducing the seismic vulnerability of precast construction in both the U.S. and
              Turkey.
