Project Abstract

The objective of
              this proposal is to explore the feasibility of using remote sensing technology,
              in particular Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging, to quantify the scope and
              magnitude of damage after major earthquakes.  To accomplish this objective, we
              plan on using a combination of technologies and modeling techniques from the
              remote sensing and loss estimation areas.  An important element of this plan
              will be the use of damage information and data from the Turkey and Taiwan
              earthquakes to calibrate and test the resulting methodology.  The research plan
              is described in three major phases: (1) development of methodology and
              collection of remote sensing and damage data from the 1999 Turkey (Izmit) and
              1999 Taiwan (Chi-Chi) earthquakes, (2) calibration of methodology using data
              from the Izmit earthquake, and (3) application and validation of methodology
              using data from the Chi-Chi earthquake.  The present proposal is directed at
              Phases 1 and 2 only.  A second proposal will be submitted after completion of
              this study to expand the analysis to the Chi-Chi Earthquake.
