Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for the third conference on Metabolic
              Engineering. Meetings I and II were held in Danvers, Mass. in 1996 and Elmau,
              Germany, in 1998, respectively. Among the key sessions planned
              are:
Experimental and computational tools; Applications of ME to medicine;
              pharmaceuticals; and fine chemicals
ME and biocomplexity; New directions,
              etc.

Many members of the organizing committee, steering committee, and a
              number of the speakers are academic researchers actively working on
              Bioengineering Division research grants. The meeting will be cofunded by the
              Whitaker Foundation and industrial contributions. The funds will be used to
              support travel by U.S. academic participants.
