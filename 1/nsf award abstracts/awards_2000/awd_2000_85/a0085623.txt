Abstract    :
              This award provides funding from the Directorate of Geoscience to develop
              secondary school instructional  materials that teach ocean science using
              Geographic Information System (GIS) data. The GIS-based instructional materials
              will be called "Mapping an Ocean Sanctuary" and will consist of five modules
              that will help the learner master GIS technology; employ GIS to study the
              surface and underwater geography of (and bathymetric, ecological, and
              geophysical data from) three national marine sanctuaries; collect geophysical
              and ecological data during field studies at the sanctuaries and use GIS to map
              and analyze the data; and share data and analyses with other students and
              schools via the Internet. The work is a collaborative effort between the Center
              for Image Processing in Education (CIPE) and the Sustainable Seas Expeditions
              (SSE). It will use data collected in the Monterey Bay, Channel Islands, and
              Florida Keys Marine Sanctuaries.
