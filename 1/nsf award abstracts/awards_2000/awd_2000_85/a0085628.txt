Abstract    :
              The objective of this effort is to understand properties of oligobacteria that
              allow growth in extremely dilute solutions in order to facilitate examination
              for extraterrestrial life. While dominant in terms of biomass in aquatic
              systems, typical forms are rarely if ever cultivated. New techniques such as
              growth from single cells give improved examples of typical forms and the
              strategy outlined is to generate cultures that may taken as examples for
              detailed examination. Procedures are designed to optimize culturability by
              observing numerous cultures inoculated with statistically abundant single
              cells. The populations appearing are visualized by flow cytometry and the
              number of species are assayed by molecular techniques using novel statistical
              formulations to assess viability. Sensitivity to the initiation of growth is
              examined by culture media amendments. Nutrient responses are examined within
              the framework of novel Janusian kinetics that relate organism construction to
              nutrient sequestering ability. Key questions involve artifactual contamination
              and substrate accelerated death. Fresh water will therefore be used to
              eliminate some salt-associated problems during media preparation. Temperature
              and species-species interactions will be evaluated as well. The cultures will
              be characterized physiologically and genetically. One objective is to obtain a
              representative culture for gene sequencing as an aid to a detailed
              understanding of the functionality of oligobacteria.
