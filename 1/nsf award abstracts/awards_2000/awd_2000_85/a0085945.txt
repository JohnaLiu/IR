Abstract    :
              Vast musical databases are currently accessible over computer networks (e.g.,
              the Web), creating a need for sophisticated methods to search and organize
              these databases. Because music is a multifaceted, multi-dimensional medium, it
              demands specialized representations, abstractions and processing techniques for
              effective search that are fundamentally different from those used for other
              retrieval tasks. By exploiting reductionist theories of musical structure and
              performance (i.e., musical style), this project will develop hierarchical,
              stochastic music representations and concomitant storage and retrieval
              mechanisms that are well-suited to music's unique characteristics, and are both
              musically and psycho-acoustically plausible. A software system exploiting these
              representations and retrieval mechanisms will be developed that accepts sonic
              input, compares abstractions of this input to those in a database of digital
              recordings, returns sonic samples of the database that best match the query,
              and allows the user to refine the query using music/acoustic-based interfaces
              of varying degrees of complexity. This research will yield a working
              music-search engine will application to e-commerce and will provide new
              scientific knowledge in terms of algorithms and mathematic models in the fields
              of databases, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, signal processing
              and perception, for music search and retrieval, which will generalize to other
              multimedia processing tasks.
