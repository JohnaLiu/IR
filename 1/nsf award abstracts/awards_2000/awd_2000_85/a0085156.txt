Recent demands for polymers exhibiting chemical inertness,
              low adhesion (friction), high wear resistance, and good biocompatibility have
              necessitated the discovery of surface treatments that can alter the
              physicochemical surface properties of polymers without affecting the bulk
              characteristics.  This research is on plasma-assisted modification of the
              surface chemistry and microstructure of various polymer materials used in the
              medical field(i.e., polyethylene, polyurethane, polycarbonate,
              polymethylmethacrylate, and polystyrene).  The proposed research will utilize
              state-of-the-art plasma-assisted surface modification, microanalysis, and
              tribotesting techniques suitable for evaluating the material response at
              different scales.  The novelty of the proposed surface modification method
              stems from the use of different plasma compositions to modify, in a controlled
              fashion, the surface chemistry (e.g., crafting of low-surface long-chain
              molecules in the near-surface region) of the polymers.  Since the resulting
              surface properties and chemical state strongly depend on controlling process
              conditions, basic research elucidating the effects of plasma treatment
              parameters (e.g., power density, plasma composition, working pressure, and gas
              flow rate)  on the chemical behavior  (e.g., crafting of protein friendly
              molecules, surface energy, and degree of hydrophilicity)  and tribological
              properties of the polymers will be conducted.  The ultimate objective is to
              develop a plasma treatment technique that enables modification of the surface
              chemistry, microstructure, and mechanical/tribological properties of polymers
              used in various medical applications.  Specifically, in addition to obtaining
              insight into the surface characteristics of plasma-treated polymers, the
              information derived from this research should have direct implications to the
              fabrication of low-friction catheters for non-invasive cardiovascular treatment
              and design of wear-resistant artificial joints exhibiting good
              biocompatibility.
