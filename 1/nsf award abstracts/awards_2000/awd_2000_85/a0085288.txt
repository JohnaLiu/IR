Abstract    :
              Turkish government and non-governmental organizations failed to anticipate the
              scale of human needs following the August 17, 1999 earthquake.  Scenario based
              needs estimation modeling is essential to the development of response and
              recovery strategies, plans and organizational structures needed to prepare for
              future earthquakes.  The purpose of the proposed research is to identify,
              collet, synthesize and quality assure human needs planning data required to
              populate and calibrate these models before this data is lost or the ability ti
              interpret data is degraded.  The resulting data bases will be made available on
              their internet for researchers and emergency planners.
