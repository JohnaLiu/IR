Abstract    :
              
A New Class of Stabilized Methods for Multiscale

Problems in Computational
              Solid Mechanics


Many problems in mechanics of materials involve operation
              of multiple spatial and temporal scales. The issue of scales gets compounded in
              micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). A general trend in engineering 
              practice toward miniaturization of mechanical and electronic components in MEMS
              highlights the need for computational techniques that can successfully address
              this issue. The research being  proposed here is aimed at developing a new
              class of multiple scale methods for the modeling and analysis of coupled
              electro-magnetic fields in semiconductor materials. Educational activities in
              this program include the development of curriculum on micro-mechanical issues
              in MEMS and a new course on multi-scale finite element method.
