Abstract    :
              This award provides funding from the AFGE program to develop an educational
              program that will complement the New Millennium Observatory (NeMO), a
              multi-year research project investigating an active submarine volcano located
              on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. The goal of the NeMO Project is to understand the
              dynamics interrelations between volcanic events, the chemistry of seafloor hot
              springs, and the biological communities that inhabit them. Scientists use
              remotely operated vehicles, advanced sampling and mapping tools, and
              sophisticated seafloor instruments during annual cruises to the site. The
              objective of this proposal is to 1) develop a new web-based geoscience
              curriculum based on the NeMO research project for middle and high school
              teachers, 2) conduct a teacher development workshop to train teachers to use
              the new curriculum, and 3) create new public exhibits for two of the most
              visited museums in the region.
