	This project will design, fabricate, and test a prototype
              next-generation automatic weather station (AWS) for use in polar regions.  The
              current network of AWS units relies on a twenty-year old design that has proven
              very reliable, however critical components are no longer available and newer
              and improved versions make a redesign not only feasible, but also necessary. 
              The next generation AWS will incorporate the current capability to operate in a
              harsh environment, and to transmit data through System Argos receiver on polar
              orbiting satellites, but will also consume much less power, be much more
              flexible in its ability to interface with many different sensors, offer greatly
              reduced component size, and significantly greater processing power.  It will
              also anticipate the Argos-3 satellite platform that will allow two-way
              communication with the AWS network deployed in Antarctica.
