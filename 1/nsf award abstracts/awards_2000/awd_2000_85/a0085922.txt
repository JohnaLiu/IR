Title: ITR:
              QUANTUM COMPUTING USING ELECTRONS ON HELIUM FILMS

This project is a combined
              experimental and theoretical research effort to manufacture and investigate a
              system of interacting quantum bits (qubits) based on electrons on a helium film
              which covers an array of micro electrodes, and to develop methods for
              controlling this system.  In particular, the team is studying the lifetimes and
              coherence times of the excited state in configurations suitable for qubit
              operation, including effects of electron-electron interaction, in-plane
              confinement, and a magnetic field. Problems of broad physical interest, such as
              quantum localization and chaos in a controlled system with interacting
              excitations is also being investigated.  The project is focused on 1) trapping
              the electrons over micro dots, 2) controlling the energy-level spacing of
              targeted electrons by the microdot potential, 3) selective writing of
              information on individual qubits by appropriately tailored pulses of resonant
              microwave radiation and microdot potential 4) logical operations on a system of
              two qubits and 5) reading out the quantum register by detecting single
              electrons released from the surface or determining the electron distribution
              over energy levels with underlying micro dots, with a hope of building a system
              with a large number of qubits to be used as a multi-qubit quantum computer.  If
              successful, such a computer can be manufactured using mainly conventional
              technologies and can operate at a temperature accessible with commercial
              refrigerators.
