Abstract    :
              The project will create a distributed repository of significant 
historical
              monographs in mathematics.  The participation of these 
three institutions  is
              significant not only because of their 
pioneering work in building digital
              libraries, but also because of 
their extraordinary collections in this
              topical area.  Michigan will 
contribute 1,000 monographic volumes focusing on
              non-Euclidean 
geometry from its collection; Cornell has digitized 576 volumes
              of 
mathematical monographs, and will generate OCR to enhance access to
              
their materials.  The State and University Library Gottingen will
              
contribute digitized monographs, dissertations and multivolume works 
of the
              electronic Mathematical Archive and the database "Jahrbuch 
uber die
              Forschritte der Mathematik", funded by the Deutsche 
Forschungsgemeinschaft. 
              Its collections are regarded as unparalleled 
in this area.  These funding
              requested will be used primarily to 
develop an interoperability layer with
              the three strong digital 
library systems at these institutions.  In doing so,
              the participants 
will focus on many of the issues central to the advancement
              of 
digital libraries, including distributed repositories and integration 
of
              digital resources, advanced access and retrieval, high levels of
              
interoperability, and models for dissemination and use.
