Thule
              burial sites in the Point Barrow, Alaska area have been exposed by storm-driven
              erosion. Archaeologists will survey the sites, attempting to recover
              information from the most endangered sections, and test less endangered areas
              to determine if there are more archaeological deposits that can shed light on
              the Thule culture. Historic remains are also endangered and will be
              investigated in this community-based project with the Barrow Arctic Science
              Consortium and the Ukpeagvik Inupiat Corporation.
