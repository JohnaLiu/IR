Abstract    :
              HomeNetToo is a research project designed to address two fundamental questions:
              What causes people to use or not use the Internet?  What effect does Internet
              use have on people?  A model of Internet use is proposed that addresses these
              questions by considering motivational, affective, and cognitive factors as
              antecedents and consequences of Internet use.  Participants in HomeNetToo will
              be low-income African American and European American families who will be
              introduced to the Internet as a communication tool or an information tool. 
              On-line surveys and computer-logged measures of Internet use will be used to
              test hypotheses about the antecedents and consequences of Internet use over an
              18-month trial.  Relationships between cognitive style and interface design
              will also be examined.  Results will have implications for how to reduce the
              digital divide, how to design user interfaces to accommodate diverse cognitive
              styles, and for identifying factors that influence whether Internet use will
              have desirable personal, social and professional consequences.
