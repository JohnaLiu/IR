Abstract    :
              The LA-USP, building upon the infrastructure and improved student outcomes
              emanating from previous funding under the National Science Foundation's Urban
              Systemic Initiative effort, focuses on enhancing the capacity of the system as
              a whole, and the instructional workforce in particular, in order to support all
              students in learning and mastering standards-based mathematics and science at a
              level sufficient for successful matriculation to university or the workforce. 
              Building upon the accomplishments of the LA-USI, LAUSD proposes specific goals
              that are congruent with the USP solicitation goals and exemplify a core vision
              of success for all.  Through the LA-USP, LAUSD intends to: 
(1) raise the
              district's capacity to bring the highest quality of mathematics and science
              instruction to students; 
(2) substantially increase all students'
              achievement, pass rates, access to college and careers in mathematics, science,
              and technology, with special attention to underrepresented minorities; 
(3)
              scale-up implementation of standards-based curricula, pedagogy, and assessment
              for all students through Differentiated Professional Development (DPD); 
(4)
              align mathematics and science instruction so that grade-appropriate content and
              processes lead progressively to higher level science and mathematics for all
              students; 
(5) increase the number of college-eligible students and the number
              majoring in mathematics and science by increasing enrollment in Advanced
              Placement (AP) mathematics and science courses; 
(6) improve instructional
              workforce quality in collaboration with universities by developing appropriate
              pre- and in-service courses in mathematics and science; 
(7) work with
              university and district partners to connect teachers' in-service professional
              development to the standard-based student expectations; 
(8) engage parents in
              advocacy and action roles related to enrollment in advanced mathematics
              courses, as well as promote parental interactions with preservice teachers in
              order to encourage such interactions with families by teachers in the future;
              and 
(9) effectively use internal and external research and evaluation to
              assess progress for all students, and to identify interactive factors that
              foster present gains as foundational for increased future gains.  

In order
              to accomplish these goals, the LA-USP staff will (A) use Differentiated
              Professional Development (DPD), a platform for in-service, that shapes sessions
              to fit teacher needs; (B) increase dissemination of program information to the
              community; (C) accelerate collaboration with higher education to equip teacher
              graduates with new skills needed for LAUSD's multilingual, multicultural,
              multiethnic enrollment; and (D) restructure instructional services to fit the
              reorganization of the LAUSD's administrative structure in order to meet the
              system's need for DPD and accountability for student achievement.   Central to
              the implementation of the USP is the expansion of the MST Centers and attendant
              Resource Teachers to serve all of the recently formulated eleven (11) local
              school districts that comprise the united district that is the Los Angeles
              Unified School District.
