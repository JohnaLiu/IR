Abstract    :
              0085354  Pagilla  The objective of this research is to explore the genetic
              engineering of Burkholderia sp. with Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) gene (vgb)
              to enhance its ability to degrade 2,4-dinitrotoluene in soil and groundwater. 
              Burkholderia strain R34 is known to degrade DNT by oxidative pathway, and
              Vitreoscilla, although a strict aerobe, grows in oxygen-limiting environments
              due to its ability to synthesize hemoglobin.  The broad focus of the proposed
              research is to incorporate vgb from Vitreoscilla into Burkholderia and other
              organisms to improve bioremediation of contaminated soils and groundwater under
              oxygen limiting conditions.  The specific objectives of the proposed research
              are to 1) investigate the transformation of Burkholderia DNT R34 strain with
              vgb (encoding Vitreoscilla hemoglobin VHb) to create Burkholderia strain YV1,
              2) determine the influence of vgb/VHb on the growth, oxygen uptake and DNT
              degradation behavior of Burkholderia, 3) investigate DNT degradation by R34 and
              YV1 strains under oxygen limiting conditions such as in soil and groundwater
              and 4) integrate vgb into the chromosome of Burkholderia for enhanced DNT
              degradation under oxygen limiting conditions.  If successful, this project will
              provide a way to overcome the difficulty of sufficient oxygen supply to
              bacteria in aerobic bioremediation of contaminated soil and groundwater. ***
