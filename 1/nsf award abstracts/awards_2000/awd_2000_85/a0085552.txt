Environmental issues in the geosciences can be used to
              develop student abilities and understanding in the sciences and are germane to
              a number of the National Science Standards.  It is the goal of the Shared Air
              project to connect students to their atmospheric environment, offer them
              experience in making models of how air is shared and modified by human actions,
              and introduce them to laws of nature through their understanding of how the
              atmospheric system works.  The activities include: (1) Enhancement of an
              initial software and curriculum design with the addition of integrated
              collaborative and data analysis tools, (2) Implementation of curriculum and
              software package to an invited and volunteer base of classrooms in the
              Midwestern United States, and (3) Evaluation of its use as a project-based
              learning tool for middle and high-school students for exploration of the
              atmospheric environment, and (4) Presentation to traditional and Internet-based
              publishing communities to facilitate the self-sufficiency of the developed
              program in subsequent years.  Students will use an enhanced software tool based
              on a model originally developed at the University of Michigan to determine
              where their air has been and to compare observations with other participants
              along the path of the air quality elsewhere as it traverses the country.
