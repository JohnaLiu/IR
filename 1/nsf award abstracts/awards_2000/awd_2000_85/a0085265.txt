The August 1999 Turkish earthquake offers a unique
              opportunity to study how hazardous materials releases may be triggered by
              earthquakes.  In this project, Turkish industrial facilities will be surveyed
              to learn what types of hazardous materials released occurred and what types of
              mitigation and emergency response measures were effective.  The data will be
              tabulated and hazard assessment methods employed to describe the series of
              events, which led to these releases.  Recommendations for making the U.S. and
              Turkish hazardous material management plans and emergency response procedures
              more responsive to the particular needs generated by joint natural and
              technological disasters will be offered.
