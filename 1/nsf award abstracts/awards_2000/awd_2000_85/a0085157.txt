Abstract    :
                   This study proposes to explore the ways in which language and patterns of
              discourse shape innovation and change in complex adaptive human systems, here
              focused on changes in communication interaction among representatives of the
              Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and nuclear industry stakeholders. The
              context for change is an industry-wide change initiative in which the NRC
              engaged industry stakeholders in a dialogue to develop and implement a revised
              reactor oversight process (RROP). The RROP initiative is considered by industry
              experts to be a significant innovation in the way that NRC interacts with its
              regulated clients.
Using a grounded theory methodology, the study will compare
              and contrast two patterns of communication interaction, one that occurred
              during the development of the RROP change initiative, and the other reflecting
              the traditional form of communication interaction among representatives of the
              NRC and the nuclear industry. As a consultant in the industry the researcher is
              a participant observer and has an unusually high degree of access to project
              data and participants in the study. The study has the support of the NRC, the
              Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) and
              nuclear power plant management.
