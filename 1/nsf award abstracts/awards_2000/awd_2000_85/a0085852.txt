Abstract    :
              This research examines the global diffusion of Internet-based electronic
              commerce, how national environments and policies influence e-commerce use
              within countries, and the economic and social impacts of e-commerce. The
              project employs both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, including a
              comparative study of diffusion across 42 countries and detailed case studies in
              eight countries that look at the growth of e-commerce nationally, and also in
              three critical industry sectors: high-technology, financial services and
              retail. These studies will identify key trends in diffusion, critical
              environmental and policy factors that influence the diffusion, and major
              impacts of e-commerce. The project will be carried out by researchers from
              computer science, social systems and management and will involve data
              collection collaboration with experts from a total of eight countries,
              including Brazil, Denmark, France, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, Taiwan, and the
              United States. The outcomes of the research include 1) new scientific
              understanding of the use and impacts of e-commerce in different countries, 2)
              baseline benchmarks for future studies of industry, national and global trends,
              3) strategic insights for business executives involved in global e-commerce, 4)
              policy insights for governments to promote and maximize the benefits of global
              commerce, and 5) extension of the research community through the education of
              graduate students.
