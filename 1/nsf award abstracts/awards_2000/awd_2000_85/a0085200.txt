Abstract    :
              This award supports the development of a prototype in-situ fossil air melt
              extraction device (INFAMED) for recovering large volumes of air and particles
              from polar ice sheets.  Although this device would have a number of
              applications, the primary initial scientific objective would be to measure
              radiocarbon in atmospheric methane trapped in the ice at depth.  This
              measurement would provide a definitive test of the hypothesis that
              decomposition of sedimentary methane clathrates caused the abrupt atmospheric
              methane concentration increases at the end of the last glacial period.  In
              addition to studies of gases extracted from the ice sheet, such an instrument
              would allow large volumes of ice to be sampled and filtered for the collection
              of both terrestrial and extraterrestrial particles.  The first phase of
              technology development involves a pilot project to explore feasibility at low
              cost, and will recover preindustrial air from depth in the Greenland ice sheet.
               If the technology is successful, a second proposal will be submitted to
              construct a full-sized device, designed to reach 1000 m depth and sample 15,000
              year old air at the South Pole.
