Abstract    :
              This project is collecting, organizing, and maintaining geoscience data sets
              focusing on the Solid Earth component of the geosciences for a national digital
              library for science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education.
              Concurrent with this effort the project is developing advanced, dynamic
              Java-based user tools to manipulate, map, model, analyze, and visualize the
              collected data sets. The focus on the Solid Earth component is intended to
              complement the work of groups in the oceanic and atmospheric sciences,
              resulting in more complete geoscience data sets.
