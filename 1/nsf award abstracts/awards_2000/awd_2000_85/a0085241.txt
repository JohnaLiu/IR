Abstract    :
              This work will develop a new type of refrigerator to cool astronomical infrared
              detectors to less than 1K using the new pulse tube technology.  USAP currently
              spends about $1M per year providing liquid helium to South Pole for this
              purpose.  If this effort is fully successful than most of that money can be
              saved and even more science will be obtained from the South Pole telescopes. 
              The cooler will have application at other sites as well and possibly eventually
              in space.
