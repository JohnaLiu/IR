Abstract    :
              The Pittsburgh Public Schools (PPS) have made a strong commitment to, and
              significant progress in, establishing standards-based education.  The greatest
              progress to date is in mathematics, partially due to the PRIME professional
              development project.  Standards-based mathematics instruction has been fully
              implemented in 15% of the elementary and 36% of the middle schools, and at
              least partially implemented in almost all of them.  The achievement gains in
              the high-implementation schools have shown impressive results.  This model will
              lead to the implementation of standards-based mathematics education
              district-wide.  In addition, the model is being used in implementing
              standards-based reform in science.

USP support will provide resources needed
              to  (a) bring mathematics reform to scale in all PPS elementary and middle
              schools as well as up to the high schools;  (b) fully engage in implementing
              science reform, using the model employed in mathematics; and  (c) leverage
              additional resources to enable the extension of the PPS' current success far
              more quickly.  The ultimate goal of the USP is to establish standard-based
              mathematics and science education systemically, so that all PPS classrooms and
              schools effectively support all students in meeting high standards.
