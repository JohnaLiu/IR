The PI will execute
              work at the leading edge of microrheological measurements.  His past studies
              have led to the development of a novel measurement instrument which has been
              adopted by other laboratories.  It is expected that a similar benefit may
              derive from this investigation.

His work will examine the rheological
              properties of the thin gelatin layer between an air/water and an oil/water
              interface.  He will also examine the rheological properties of a nematic
              monolayer.  The support letter from the Kodak Company emphasizes the major
              contribution which this work will provide to the photographic, food, paper and
              pharmaceutical industries.
