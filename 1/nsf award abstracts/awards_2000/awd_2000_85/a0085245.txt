              ABSTRACT
Kamb- 0085245

This award supports the development of a new
              core-drilling system for obtaining samples of bedrock and glacial sediment from
              beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet, with applicability  to arctic glaciers and the
              Greenland Ice Sheet.  Such samples are needed for a wide variety of
              investigations of antarctic and arctic geology, geochemistry, glaciology and
              geobiology.  Examples are studies of sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the West
              Antarctic rift system, studies of the fast-moving West Antarctic ice streams,
              and microbiological studies of life under the extreme conditions at the basal
              ice-bedrock contact. The core-drilling capability will make it possible to
              carry out such investigations over the 98% of the Antarctic continent that is
              covered by the ice sheet and thus has been inaccessible for sampling up to now.
               The system involves the coupling of two proven drilling technologies that are
              both based on a source of high-pressure water: 1) hot-water jet drilling to
              drill rapidly through the ice, and 2) hydromechanical rotary drilling to drill
              into the underlying sediments or bedrock.
