Abstract    :
              The project is driven by the vision of a Global InfoBase (GIB): a ubiquitous and
              universal information resource, simple to use, up to date, and comprehensive. 
              Towards this vision, the project is developing technologies needed to transform
              today's World-Wide Web into the GIB. The project consists of four interrelated
              thrusts:

* Integration of existing technologies into a ``universal''
              information model and query language.

* Personalized information management,
              so users obtain more relevant and timely information.

* Sophisticated
              semantic-analysis tools.

* Algorithms for mining information to synthesize
              new knowledge.

The Web has created a resource comprising much of the world's
              knowledge.  Yet today our ability to use the Web as an information resource is
              in a primitive state.  The GIB project is developing technology that will allow
              society far more effective and efficient use of the dramatically growing amount
              of information available online.
