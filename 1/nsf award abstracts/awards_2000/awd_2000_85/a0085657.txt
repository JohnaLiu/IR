Abstract    :
              This project is building a collection of references to resources that offer a
              broad, balanced perspective of topics relating to the origins, functions, and
              legacies of the Manhattan Project. The materials referenced include books,
              articles, videos, and vetted web sites. The critical task of the Alsos project
              is the integration of these references into a structured collection that allows
              users to examine this important period of history from many perspectives, thus
              strengthening the quality of science, mathematics, engineering, and technology
              education by connecting different disciplines, issues, and ideas. Searching and
              indexing tools link the components of Alsos and facilitate the exploration of
              these materials for general readers and specialists alike. In addition to the
              references, Alsos contains a set of indexed, digitized sound tracks and images.
              A clear, intuitive user interface provides seamless navigation through all of
              these components.
