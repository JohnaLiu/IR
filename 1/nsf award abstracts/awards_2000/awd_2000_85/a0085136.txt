Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for establishing the fundamental principles for
              realizing open product architectures by building upon constructal theory
              developed in the field of thermodynamics.  Constructal principles along with
              concepts and techniques from engineering design will be utilized to develop and
              instantiate the foundational mathematics to provide mathematical rigor for the
              methodology to engineer open product architectures.  The principles and the
              methodology will be verified by analytically and will be illustrated through
              two industrial test cases, namely, the design of beverage merchandisers for a
              mass customized production system and a family of absorption chillers.

This
              work, if successful, will provide the proof-of-concept for the development of a
              formal, mathematically rigorous methodology for designing product architectures
              that are open, that is, flexible in accommodating product  evolution with a
              process of continuous improvement and adaption.   The successful use of this
              methodology by manufacturing enterprises will allow them to respond rapidly and
              cost-effectively to 
changes in the market and/or demands for customized
              products.
