Abstract    :
              
The Hamilton County Department of Education's (HCDE), Mathematics and Science
              Synergy (MaSS) supports the continuation and expansion of HCDE's efforts
              initiated through the infrastructure and success of the Chattanooga
              Comprehensive Partnerships for Mathematics and Science Achievement (CPMSA). 
              Through MaSS, HCDE will provide "the exemplary mathematics and science
              education that each child needs and deserves to meet the challenges of the
              twenty-first century."  MaSS has at its core the development of a cadre of
              building-level lead teachers of mathematics and science, building-based on-site
              activities facilitated by district "consulting teachers," and professional
              development of all educational stakeholders, including guidance counselors,
              administrators, and community members.  In order to attain the challenging
              targets for improved student achievement that HCDE has set forth, MaSS
              delineates six (6) "Essential Components:"
* Intensify the implementation of a
              district-wide standards-based SMET curriculum, instruction, assessment, and
              supporting professional development;
* Strengthen the alignment between
              district policies and MaSS goals;
* Institutionalize a culture of continuous
              improvement by increasing school and district organizational capacity;
*
              Broaden parent and community involvement;
* Increase the competency and
              diversity of the mathematics and science workforce; and
* Employ research as
              an effective tool in improving the teaching and learning of mathematics and
              science program.

MaSS will support 42,220 students in eighty (80) schools to
              succeed in a rigorous high-quality standards-based mathematics and science.
