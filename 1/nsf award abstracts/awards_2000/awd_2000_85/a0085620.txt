Web-based Investigations in the Geosciences (WIG) is a
              multidisciplinary, broad-audience endeavor, targeting undergraduate and
              graduate students, pre-college science teachers, and those in their charge. 
              The core of this initiative involves the development, field-testing and
              implementation of inquiry-based GIS (Geographic Information Systems)/GPS
              (Global Positioning System) modules and "virtual geologic field trips" that
              will be widely distributed over the Internet.  With the assistance of a
              graduate student intern, the Principal Investigator of the proposed project
              will gather and organize spatial data to construct critical thinking activities
              in which geologic, biologic, geographic, meteorologic, and other GIS layers are
              combined into Earth Systems puzzles.  The modules will be in the form of
              interactive directed inquiry lessons and "virtual field trips" in which the
              end-user will explore a remote terrain in search of physical evidence to help
              solve a problem.  The PI of this project will employ the assistance of current
              students within San Jose State University's College of Science, who will
              collect further spatial data as part of Geology course requirements.  Current
              students will also field-test the modules before they are more widely
              distributed via several public and private Internet servers.  Dissemination
              strategies also include pre-college and in-service teacher workshops, national
              conference participation, and journal articles on the project's resources.  WIG
              will make available Web-based student-centered activities, archived data sets
              to conduct spatial investigations, and virtual field trips for use in colleges
              and secondary schools around the country, or internationally.
