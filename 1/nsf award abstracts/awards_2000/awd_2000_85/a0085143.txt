Project title: "Investigation of Soil Liquefcation in the 1999
              Chi-Chi, Taiwan, Earthquake" 
PI: C. H. Juang 
Institution: Clemson
              University

This research project is aimed at improving the geotechnical
              engineer's ability to assess liquefaction potential using in-situ tests.  The 
              project seeks to acquire, document, and disseminate field liquefacation data
              from the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake.  The significance of this project
              lies in the fact that the data collected from the Chi-Chi earthquake will
              greatly expand the existing databases, particularly for high values of cyclic
              stress ratio and silty and gravelly sands.  The collected data will be made
              available at no cost to other parties on the World Wide Web upon completion of
              the project.  The web page created for this project will be updated
              periodically to include additional new data and the results of the subsequent
              analysis.
