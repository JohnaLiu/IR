Janet L. Siefert

Dr. Janet L. Siefert of Rice University, and
              Dr. James F. Kasting of Pennsylvania State University have been awarded a grant
              from the Life in Extreme Environments (LExEn) program to trace past
              environmental crises in Earth history by using  a combination of
              climate/biogeochemistry modeling and molecular systematic techniques. Models
              will help predict what kinds of organisms were capable of making the changes in
              atmosphere  and to simulate interaction of different species ofmicroorganisms.
              For instance, initially archaea that produced methane might have dominated and
              then were usurped by bacteria that produced oxygen (cyanobacteria).
              Cyanobacteria are known to have existed by at least 2.7 Ga, so why does the
              rise in oxygen not occur for another 0.3 Ga? Their models will attempt to
              explain discrepancies such as this. Molecular systematic techniques will use
              DNA sequence data to track the ancestry of organisms and their genomes. These
              reconstructed ancestries will reveal which organisms were most likely present,
              whether there is evidence of 'molecular fossils' of new kinds of metabolism
              that may have evolved, and whether or not the assumptions of the
              climate/biogeochemical models make sense.
