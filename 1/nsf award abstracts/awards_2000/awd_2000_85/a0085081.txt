Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funding for supplementing the purchase of a
              servo-hydraulic material testing system. Two-thirds of the funding required has
              been committed by external sources, namely the Asphalt Paving Association of
              Washington, Washington State DOT, and internally by Washington State University
              (WSU). This system is to be utilized jointly by the geotechnical and pavement
              engineering faculty at WSU in conducting student/technical personnel training
              and research.  It will allow hands-on training of an average of 75 students
              enrolled in 5 undergraduate and graduate courses to state of the art methods of
              asphalt concrete  and soil testing. These include the resilient modulus of
              asphalt concretes  (AASHTO TP31/ASTM D4123), the fatigue and creep testing of
              asphalt concretes (AASHTO TP9 and  TP-9, resp.) and the resilient modulus of
              aggregates/soils (AASHTO T294-94).   Two particular research studies will be
              made possible with the proposed servo-hydraulic material testing system. The
              first will explore the visco-plastic response of the constituents of asphalt
              concretes to dynamic loads utilizing imaging techniques. The second will study
              the dynamic response of cohesive soil subgrades to shear stresses of various
              magnitudes and frequencies, in the light of recent developments in critical
              state soil mechanics.
