Abstract    :
              Recently combinatorial methods have played important role in mathematical
              research.  The theory of symmetric polynomials and other (non-symmetric)
              classical polynomials is particular important due to its applications in
              topology, representation theory, algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory as
              well as mathematical physics.  Schur polynomials and Schubert polynomials stand
              out as one of the major combinatorial objects in connections with  the
              enumerative geometry of manifolds, Yang-Baxter equations, Hecke algebras and
              quantum groups.  In order to make this area of investigation accessible to a
              wide audience we are holding an NSF/CBMS regional conference on Algebraic
              Combinatorics at North Carolina State University in Raleigh during June 4-8,
              2001. The principal speaker is Professor Alain Lascoux, from Universite de
              Marne-la-Vallee, who will give a series of 10 lectures on ``Multivariate
              Polynomials''.  As a leading figure in algebraic combinatorics, Professor
              Lascoux (himself and jointly with his coauthors) developed many key concepts
              and tools in this field. During the 10-hour lectures he will present the
              theories
of multi-Schur functions, lambda-rings, divided differences as well
              as applications to Yang-Baxter equations.  The lecture notes of Prof. Lascoux
              will be published by CBMS within one year after the conference. The
              conference's main purpose is to attract newcomers and the secondary purpose is
              to provide a venue of discussions for experts.
