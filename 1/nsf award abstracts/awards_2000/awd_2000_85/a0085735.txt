Abstract    :
              The University of Missouri-Columbia, the National Center for Supercomputing
              Applications (NCSA), the University of Illinois, and the Missouri Botanical
              Garden are collaborating on this pilot project to build a prototype core
              integration system for a national digital library for SMET Education. The
              technical infrastructure for the system builds on the NCSA distributed
              information retrieval system, EMERGE. This system is being extended to an
              adaptive and flexible distributed search engine for a wide variety of learning
              environments and resources, and is being tested on the rich plant contents of
              the Missouri Botanical Garden, and the NSF Plant Genome projects at the
              University of Illinois (Soybean) and the University of Missouri-Columbia
              (Corn). Seamless coordination with services is being offered on several
              learning environments, including NCSA's Biology Workbench 3.2. A digital
              repository, BLOE (Biological Learning Object Exchange), serves to collect and
              organize experiments, simulations, and projects from learners and teachers for
              collaborative learning. Additional project activities include studies of
              requirements of user services, management procedures, evaluation methods, and
              technical standards using various undergraduate and graduate programs of the
              two universities and the K-12 educational activities of the Missouri Botanical
              Garden.
