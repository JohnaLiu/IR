Abstract    :
              Our society increasingly relies on prompt, accurate delivery of information over
              the Internet.  Users need assurance that the information they get in this way
              is authentic, and they need to get this assurance in a cheap and reliable
              way.

The research centers around a new approach for engendering this
              confidence.  The starting point is to separate the roles of the "owner" of a
              database and its "publisher" (or publishers).  With this approach the user need
              not trust the publisher.  Instead, the owner of the database provides the user
              with a small amount of "summary information".  After that, the publisher not
              only answers the user's questions, but also provides, along with each answer, a
              short "digital certificate" of accuracy.  Using the summary information, the
              certificate lets the user check that the information received is correct and
              complete.  Developing and evaluating good schemes to construct these
              certificates is the key technical challenge.

The publisher need not maintain
              a trusted system, lowering his cost of doing business.  The publisher can also
              more easily provide information from multiple owners.  Overall, the approach
              should make it cheaper to obtain reliable data over the Internet, and will
              expand the settings where the data is used.
