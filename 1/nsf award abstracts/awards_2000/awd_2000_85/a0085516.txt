Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to establish a collaborative team of
              experts from the chemistry of molecular electronics, the physics of electronic
              conduction at the molecular scale, advanced electronic structure, transport
              properties and experimental agreement, and silicon device and circuits
              technology to address the challenges of electronics at the quantum scale. This
              will require modeling and simulation involving multiple length and energy
              scales, starting from atomic Hamiltonians and going to complex circuits.
              Leveraging advances in molecular self-assembly, interfacial control, and the
              use of scanning probes, we will examine molecular bridges between bulk
              contacts, and relate the general features observed in experiments to
              simulations which compute the Landauer conductance from the Green's function of
              the molecule coupled to bulk, metal leads. Very recent, interesting, and
              potentially useful, reversible switching characteristics that have been
              observed will be analyzed theoretically. The systems typically consist of hard
              contacts (semiconductors or metals) and soft molecules that may exhibit dynamic
              structure modification. The objectives of this multi-disciplinary, small group
              effort are: i) to understand the physical and electronic structure and vibronic
              interactions of molecular bridges between hard contacts, ii) to develop a
              theoretical understanding of the interesting nonlinear I-V characteristics of
              molecules that are now being observed and to relate them to the structure of
              the molecule, iii) to devise methods for extracting physics-based, circuit
              models from the Hamiltonian of molecular electronic devices and iv) to use this
              knowledge and the simulation tools developed to identify molecular structures
              that are promising from a device and circuits perspective.

The development
              of an understanding of how to relate electronic device and circuit function to
              molecular structure is the key objective of the proposed research. Other
              important components and products of this work include: i) the development of a
              set of 'community codes' for molecular nanoelectronics that emphasize the
              structure/function relationship of molecular devices and that connect them to
              the macroscopic world of circuits and systems, ii) a methodology to allow a
              researcher to suggest a particular structure, electrodes, and interfacial
              linkages, predict the electrical performance of the device, and to extract a
              circuit model, iii) a unique software infrastructure, The Computational
              Electronics Hub, that will permit users to access and operate simulation tools
              through a WWW browser, iv) a set of courses that will be enriched and expanded
              by this multidisciplinary effort, v) close interactions with leading
              experimental efforts in academia (Reed at Yale) and industry, vi) a partnership
              with the NIST group to provide expertise in advanced molecular electronic
              structure methods, vii) collaboration with international centers, particularly
              the Central University of Venezuela, viii) A high-school level teaching module
              in the Materials World Modules program, and ix) close interactions with the
              Semiconductor Research Corporation and with individual semiconductor companies
              to bring ideas and approaches of self-assembled molecular electronics to the
              electronics industry.
