This project is proposed in order to improve casualty
              estimation models for earthquakes by using data from the earthquakes which
              occurred in 1999 as additional datapoints for the refinement of the existing
              models.  The investigators will collaborate with Taiwanese researchers to
              collect available injury and damage data.  This data will be summarized,
              categorized into the standard categorization scheme (currently under
              development), and made available on the UCLA CPHDR website.  Additional
              analysis of he Colombia data (and Greece and Turkey if available), including
              review of building damage and matching the damage data to the injury data are
              planned.
