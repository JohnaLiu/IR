This study focuses on governmental and institutional
              response to the 9/21 Earthquake in Taiwan that occurred in September of 1998,
              leaving almost 2,500 people dead and many thousands injured and homeless.  A
              major issue in disaster studies is the capacity of local governments to respond
              to a major disaster and the relationships between local governments and the
              national governments.  Data will be collected from interviews with local and
              national government officials as well as members of NGOs and other private
              sector responders to the 9/21 earthquake.  These data will be used to extend
              our understanding of intergovernmental relations after disasters.
