Abstract    :
              This award will support the analysis of the Dynamics Explorer measurements of
              vertical winds made with the WATS mass spectrometer.  The data would be treated
              to remove the effects of a slowly varying bias by analyzing the raw unaveraged
              data to determine the variance of the observations.  Different methods for
              determining this variance would be explored.  The purpose of this effort is to
              gain improved insights into the effects of vertical winds in the polar region
              upon the composition of the auroral thermosphere. The typically large vertical
              winds of the this region are believed to have major effects upon the
              composition as a result of the modified mixing that vertical winds will
              introduce. The impact of this mixing enhancement is not well understood.
