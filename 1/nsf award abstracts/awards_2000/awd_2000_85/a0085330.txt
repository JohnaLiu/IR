The Rustbelt RNA Meeting is planned for November
              3-4, 2000 in the Lodge at Deer Creek State Park in Mt. Sterling, Ohio. The
              Rustbelt RNA Meeting (RRM) is the only major Midwest regional meeting of RNA
              researchers. Last year the RRM was attended by 103 individuals including
              principal investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students from Ohio
              State University, Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve University, the
              University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Michigan,
              Indiana University, Purdue University, University of Delaware, SUNY Albany and
              the University of Illinois. Attendance in the previous year had been 77
              individuals, and we anticipate between 100 and 120 participants in 2000.

The
              objective of the RRM is to provide an inexpensive, high caliber,
              interdisciplinary regional meeting for RNA researchers in the Midwest with an
              emphasis on participation by undergraduate, and graduate and postdoctoral
              trainees. The meeting is open to principal investigators, postdoctoral fellows
              and graduate and undergraduate students who are interested in RNA in its many
              aspects. The meeting format is designed to foster interaction between trainees
              at the participating institutions with each other and with the participating
              principal investigators.
