Abstract    :
              While high-rise construction serves as one of the most challenging projects
              undertaken by society, tall buildings are one of the few constructed facilities
              whose design relies solely upon analytical and scaled models, which, though
              based upon fundamental mechanics and years of research and experience, has yet
              to be systematically validated in full-scale. To address this issue, several
              tall buildings in Chicago whose structural systems are most commonly used in
              high-rise design will be instrumented to measure response characteristics under
              the action of wind. The instrumentation will include accelerometers and high
              precision GPS systems. To facilitate unhindered access to real-time
              measurements, a Java-based internet framework will be developed, permitting the
              project team, and its advisory board of designers, consultants, and interested
              researchers, analysis capabilities from any remote location. The subsequent
              analyses, in total, will provide valuable insight into a variety of response
              characteristics for tall buildings and permit the systematic validation of
              existing design practice through the comparison of analytical and wind tunnel
              response estimates with full-scale observations. Both amplitude-dependent
              frequency and damping estimates using Wavelet-Based System Identification will
              be made to shed new light on the dynamic characteristics at varying response
              levels.
