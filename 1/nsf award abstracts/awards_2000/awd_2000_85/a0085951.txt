Abstract    :
              Collaboratories are new organizational forms to help scientists who are
              geographically dispersed to work closely together. A number of collaboratories
              have been built, and their successes and failures have been due to a
              combination of technical and social factors not yet fully synthesized. This
              project will define, abstract, and codify the underlying technical and social
              mechanisms that lead to successful collaboratories. It will provide the
              vocabulary, associated principles, and design methods for propagating and
              sustaining collaboratories across a wide range of circumstances. This project
              will enhance both the practice of science and the training of new scientists.
              These goals will be achieved through three coordinated activities: (1) The
              qualitative and quantitative study of  collaboratory design and usage,
              examining both technical and social aspects of  performance; (2) creation and
              maintenance of a Collaboratory Knowledge Base, a Web-accessible archive of
              primary source material, summaries and abstracts, and relevant generalizations
              and principles, a database of collaboratory resources, and other related
              material; and (3) the abstraction and codification of principles, heuristics,
              and frameworks to guide the rapid creation and deployment of successful
              collaboratories, including principles of design or customization.
