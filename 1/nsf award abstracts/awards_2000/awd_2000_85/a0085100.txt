Abstract    :
              This NSF supported project involves a multi-disciplinary team who will develop
              new manufacturing methods to improve the functionality of dental implants.  The
              goal of this project is to produce dental implants through new powder
              processing technologies to create functionally graded materials that can be
              biologically bonded to the human bone.  Specifically, the objectives are
              two-fold:  (1) to develop net shape/near net shape Ti implants of dense core
              with surface porosity that are coated with biocompatible hydroxyapatite (HAp)
              coating and  (2) to characterize the implants in terms of mechanical properties
              and biocompatibility.  The hypothesis is that bone re-growth will be promoted
              by the pores in the Ti that support the penetration of the HAp coating deeply
              into the substrate.  The dense Ti core will maintain the overall strength.  An
              innovative processing technique will be used to create an inverted porosity in
              Ti.  Thick films of HAp will be deposited on Ti using an electrodeposition
              technique.  The coatings will be characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy,
              X-ray diffraction, Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope, and X-ray photoelectron
              spectroscopy techniques.  Mechanical property evaluations such as hardness,
              fracture strength, and adhesion will be performed to examine the quality of the
              as-coated implants. In vitro testing in simulated body fluids will be carried
              out to evaluate its bioactivity. The surface characteristics of the implant in
              simulated fluid will be studied in situ by an Environmental Scanning Electron
              Microscope.
 
The participation of  local high school students will be one of
              the outreach activities of this project that will introduce them to the
              Biomedical Engineering field.  The high school students will work with both
              undergraduates and graduate students on this project, creating an exciting
              learning environment at all levels.
