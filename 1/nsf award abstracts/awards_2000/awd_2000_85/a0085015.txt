Abstract    :
              0085015
Based on 1992 data of the federal bridge inventory, about 39% of the
              nation's 576,665 bridges are structurally deficient due to long-term
              degradation. The use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) retrofit is attractive
              but reliable predictive models and sound design guidelines for the use of FRP
              retrofit in civil infrastructure applications are needed. The objective of the
              project is to develop innovative short-term experiments that would allow the
              development of analytical models for accurate and reliable prediction of
              long-term performance of retrofitted highway bridge structures. Specifically,
              the interfacial bond between the concrete substrate and the FRP composite
              material used for external strengthening must remain durable for the specified
              lifetime over a range of mechanical loads, temperature cycles, moisture
              diffusion and de-icing salt ingress.   Experiments and models that bridge
              several length scales will be used to develop basic understanding of
              delamination mechanisms and a predictive capability that can be used to for
              design guidelines. This is a collaborative research project between UT-Austin
              and U. of Missouri-Rolla.***
