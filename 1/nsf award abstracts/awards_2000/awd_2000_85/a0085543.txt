The PI and associates will conduct three annual 4-day
              workshops on K-14 education, with a focus on recruiting geoscientists from
              around the nation to participate.  They will develop a collection of follow-up
              activities (surveys & interviews, newsletter, and web-based resources) that
              will motivate, inform, and sustain a network of workshop alumni in K-14
              geoscience education.  Over the course of this three-year project at least 150
              scientists and educators will participate in this network.  The goals of the
              proposed project are: to build and maintain a national cadre of well informed
              geoscientists who can act as advocates and leaders for effective science
              education, and also as role models for scientific colleagues who become
              involved in improving K-14 geoscience education; to strengthen and increase the
              effectiveness of the education activities presently (and soon-to-be) underway
              in the geoscience community; and to provide geoscientists who are active in
              K-14 education with an opportunity to showcase their work and network with
              educators and other scientists involved in education.
