Abstract    :
              Seismic Fragility and Retrofit of Non-Ductile Reinforced Concrete Structures
              using New Technologies
Abstract

This project will address the applicability
              of new technologies, namely supplemental passive energy dissipation systems
              (EDS) for the retrofit of non-ductile reinforced concrete (NDRC) structures. 
              The effectiveness of various EDS alternatives will be demonstrated and
              comparative studies will be performed.  This study will be carried out based on
              the actual observed damage during the 1999 Turkey  (August 17, Marmara and
              November 12, Duzce) earthquakes.
In collaboration with researchers and
              engineers in Turkey, damage data from the 1999 Turkey earthquakes will be
              compiled.  Selected data on the damaged reinforced concrete structures will be
              utilized to develop realistic computational models using the inelastic
              structural analysis software IDARC, and to develop fragility information from
              the statistics of the observed structural response.  Retrofit design of several
              alternative EDS systems such as friction devices, metallic devices, viscous
              devices and re-centering devices will be carried out according to established
              performance criteria.  This part of the study will allow a direct and
              comprehensive comparison of the effectiveness of all the considered EDS
              systems.
Overall, this study will provide valuable information to the rational
              quantification of loss reduction through fragility changes.  The assessed
              change of fragility curves will allow immediate evaluation of the sensitivity
              of suggested retrofit solutions using EDS simultaneously considering all the
              influencing parameters, i.e. seismic hazard, seismic demand, and the capacity
              limit states of structures.
