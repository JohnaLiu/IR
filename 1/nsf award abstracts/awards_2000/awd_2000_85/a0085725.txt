Abstract    :
              This is the first year funding of a five-year continuing award.   The world of
              business and organizations is entering a period of dramatic and rapid
              technology-based transformations that many people believe will be as
              significant as those that characterized the Industrial Revolution. This project
              will investigate the profound socioeconomic changes likely to be associated
              with such transformations through conducting empirical research that is
              broad-based, in-depth, and longitudinal.   Using multiple theoretical and
              methodological approaches, a panel of strategically-selected firms in
              established as well as entrepreneurial and emergent businesses will be tracked
              over time.   A comprehensive set of systematic and grounded empirical data in
              these organizations will be collected and analyzed over five years, and will
              generate deep insights and general theories about what is really happening as
              organizations use information technology to transform how they work and
              interact with the market over time.
