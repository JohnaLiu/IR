Abstract    :
              Funding is provided to support the participation of young foreign and US
              scientists in a meeting entitled 'Biofilms 2000', that is being sponsored by
              the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). This meeting, held at the Big Sky
              Resort in Montana during the summer of 2000, brings together researchers in the
              field of bacterial biofilms from all over the world.  A similar ASM conference,
              in Snowbird, Utah in 1996, drew 360 participants from 42 countries and was
              characterized by the purposeful inclusion of young investigators, postdoctoral
              fellows and students, mostly from the US and UK. The Snowbird meeting is widely
              regarded as having defined the emerging field of Biofilm Microbiology, and many
              important connections were made between people in different  basic disciplines
              who all share a keen and urgent interest in biofilms. Because of the increased
              interest in the field, this meeting is expected to draw even more delegates. 
              Matrix enclosed biofilms are responsible for all of the beneficial (sewage
              treatment) and deleterious (corrosion, fouling) effects of bacteria in industry
              and in the environment.  Biofilms 2000 includes a full day workshop to teach
              the special biofilm methods necessary for research in this area, and a full day
              symposium on the development of a special interdisciplinary cadre of scientists
              who will carry research forward in studies of biofilms.
