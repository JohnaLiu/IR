Abstract    :
              A digital library constructed in support of a research community's activities
              contains material of direct relevance to undergraduate SMET education. However,
              its organizational structure reflects the conventions established by the
              research community, not the needs of the undergraduate student. This project is
              researching and developing software tools to organize and contextualize
              information in a research digital library so that it may better reflect the
              needs of undergraduate learners and the pedagogical goals of faculty. The
              project uses the metaphor of a "path" or "guided tour" for these organizing and
              contextualizing tools. The content testbed on which the use of "guided tours"
              is being demonstrated is a large body of Web-based material centered initially
              on WWW-based floristics and extended recently to include entomological
              materials. The tool development extends previous investigations into the
              application of paths in K-12 classrooms to include the creation of more complex
              structures, collectively known as metadocuments.
