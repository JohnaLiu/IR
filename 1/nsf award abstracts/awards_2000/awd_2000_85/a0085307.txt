This one year
              grant will permit the PI's to make initial measurements in microchannel flows
              and to provide a more refined statement of their plans to address the
              unexpected pressure drop/flow rate results obtained in prior investigations. 
              Microchannel flows present complexities that are not encountered in their macro
              scale counterparts and the PI's are well positioned to make contributions in
              this developing field.
