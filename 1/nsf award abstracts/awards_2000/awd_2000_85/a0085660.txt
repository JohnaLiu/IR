Abstract    :
              The Digital Multimedia Library for Health Sciences Education project is
              developing and implementing services for a national, publicly accessible
              database designed to facilitate uploading, cataloging, retrieval, and metadata
              exchange of multimedia items. A prototype system is under construction based on
              an extensive test collection of multimedia items from K-12 schools,
              undergraduate colleges, and medical schools. The project team expects to form
              collaborations with other projects in the NSDL Program and other professional
              health organizations to broaden the collection of multimedia and the
              collection's metadata standards. Other activities that the project team is
              engaging in include: development of policies and procedures for protecting and
              defining intellectual property rights; maintenance of a quality assurance
              system to ensure that high quality and relevant items are maintained in the
              database; and the implementation of "best practices" for incorporating
              multimedia into popular course authoring tools. The National Library of
              Medicine expects eventually to employ the project's services to host a Digital
              Multimedia Library database.
