Abstract    :
              This Polar Instrumentation and Technology Development (PITD) Project promises to
              develop several novel electro-optical instruments for atmospheric research. 
              The goal is to produce high-luminosity, rugged and reliable instruments
              suitable for unattended use in polar regions.  The devices will be based on the
              principles of Fabry-Perot interferometers which have the usual etalon gap made
              of an electro-optic material such as lithium niobate, which changes its
              effective optical thickness when an electric field is applied.  The specific
              instruments to be developed are: a rugged, enhanced-luminosity, high resolution
              Fabry-Perot spectrometer; a spectrally agile filter; and a double etalon
              modulator.  These instruments, if successfully built, should find wide
              application in many areas.
