Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funds for an exploratory operation to obtain transects of
              cores from three coastal ponds on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. These cores
              will taken with a vibracorer that will allow penetration of sand and coral
              rubble layers. The cores will then be examined for sedimentological evidence,
              including coarse layers, of past hurricane strikes on the island, and pertinent
              layers will be dated by radiocarbon methods. The results will be compared with
              an independent but complimentary study of geochemical signals of past
              hurricanes in offshore corals around the island.
