Abstract    :
              The problems associated with building complex heterogeneous systems 
composed
              of computer, human, and electromechanical components are starting
to overwhelm
              system and software engineers, resulting in failed projects
and accidents
              related to software behavior.  As the complexity of the 
systems grows, so
              does the difficulty of ensuring safety.  

Model-based system and software
              engineering is an approach to building 
complex systems that is based on
              common models and specification languages 
that are understandable and
              reviewable by all the engineers on the project 
and by those who must interact
              with and use the automation as well.  The 
research topics to be investigated
              are: (1) enhancing requirements 
specification reviewability, (2) assisting
              engineers in creating large, 
complex specifications, (3) minimizing the
              disruptions caused by changes 
in requirements, and (5) specifying and
              analyzing safety-related 
properties using the models.

To ground the
              research, the new approaches will be applied experimentally
to the advanced
              air traffic control systems being developed and
validated by Eurocontrol (the
              European Organization for the Safety of
Air Navigation).  ATC provides a
              challenging testbed but the results
of the research should be equally
              applicable to medical, defense,
transportation, manufacturing, and other
              complex, real-time systems.
