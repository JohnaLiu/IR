Abstract    :
              
This collaborative project develops interactive environments through a
              component design and production service and an assembly environment to support
              identification and reuse of curricular materials. The component design and
              production service supports collaborative creation of learning objects. It is
              aimed at programmers and focused on direct coding of components, from graphical
              user interface elements to complex simulations. It tests strategies by
              developing reusable components for selected topics in several disciplines. The
              assembly environment service is aimed at instructors. It provides an
              environment that allows for easy yet flexible creation of curriculum materials
              that utilize interactive learning objects. 

This project develops a base
              around which future work can crystallize and build new content and structure.
              It has enormous potential for facilitating the potential of creating
              ever-growing, collaboratively-driven online repositories of educational
              software components. This could result in a wealth of online resources for
              students and teachers and enable teachers to create learning environments for
              their own use and for use in the next generation of digital libraries and
              learning environments.
