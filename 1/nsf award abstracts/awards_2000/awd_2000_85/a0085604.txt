              ABSTRACT


The goal of this research project is to conduct a multi-scale
              computational and theoretical investigation of the evolution of thin film
              morphology on metal and semi-conductor surfaces.   This research involves
              several nanoscale modeling strategies: (1) ab inito electronic structure
              calculations for small-scale systems using density functional theory and
              quantum chemistry approaches for energetics, electronic effects, diffusion
              paths, and selected adsorbate vibrational modes; (2) development of robust
              model potentials from parameterization of results from the proposed ab initio
              calculations and experimental data; (3) application of recently developed
              accelerated MD code to examine novel cluster diffusion process which may appear
              when simulations are performed for micro-mili seconds; (4) determination,
              successively, of the vibrational dynamics, thermodynamics, diffusion prefactors
              and rates for small Ag clusters on proposed substrates; (5) calculation of
              energy barriers and diffusion paths for Ag clusters on proposed substrates
              using the model potentials; (6) modeling of epitaxial growth for realistic
              system sizes (microns) using the calculated diffusion rates an energetics in
              kinetic Monte Carlo technique; (7) continuum modeling of nanostructure
              relaxation using information from all of the above.  An added strategy is to
              work in tandem with on-going experiments to provide constant feedback.

This
              is a collaborative effort by researchers in chemical engineering, physics,
              chemistry and mathematics.  Together with industrial collaboration, the project
              will allow them to determine the characteristics of the systems for length and
              time scales that are several orders of magnitude larger than the atomic scales
              for which the information is initially collected.
