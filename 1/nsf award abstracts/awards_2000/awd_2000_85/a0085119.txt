Abstract    :
              This project will develop advanced broadband radio receivers and antennas to be
              buried in the ice below South Pole Station for detecting the interaction of
              ultra-high energy (PeV) astrophysical neutrinos with nuclei in the ice. 
              Ultra-high energy, with energies exceeding 1015 eV, could be used to discover
              the sources of the very highest energy cosmic rays, the source of which is a
              long standing open question.  The radio detection technique is complementary to
              the more common detection of light produced by high energy particles because
              the optical techniques begin to lose sensitivity at the ultra-high energies
              near the threshold for the radio technique.  From there on up in energy, the
              sensitivity of the radio detectors is expected to increase dramatically.  This
              rising sensitivity with energy works well with the steeply declining flux of
              cosmic rays.  The University of Kansas the leading institution in the
              development of these detectors in the United States.
