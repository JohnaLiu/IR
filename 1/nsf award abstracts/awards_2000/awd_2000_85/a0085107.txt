Abstract    :
              The Newport News Public Schools (NNPS) proposes to plan and implement a project
              titled: STEP.Com.  This project is designed to significantly advance science,
              mathematics, and technology (SMT) education of all K-12 students.  The NNPS
              would accomplish this task by building on the extant infrastructure developed
              by a systemic reform process initiated in 1992 and catalyzed by the CPMSA
              program, implemented 1993.

System components identified for more extensive
              deployment are as follows:

(1) Intensify the institutionalization of the
              K-12 science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) standards-based curriculum.
              
(2) Elevate principals' leadership capacity to promote and sustain reform.
              
(3) Expand school-business partnership programs that would increase the
              number of skilled-entrants into the technology-based workforce. 
(4)
              Accelerate the integration of parents and community as partners in the whole
              school reform process.
 
 Critically new system components include in this
              project design:
(1) Collaboration with universities to revise teacher
              education program.
(2) Expansion of student-teacher research activities
              supported by post-doctoral personnel from the universities.
(3) Infusion of
              technology to improve teachers' delivery of SMT standards-based curriculum for
              all students.
(4) Application of key indicator data systems that correlate
              teacher performance and student achievement.

This NNUSP project will lead to
              a unified, full-scale implementation of a SMT program for all students. It has
              the potential to dramatically impact the future of the Newport News Community.
