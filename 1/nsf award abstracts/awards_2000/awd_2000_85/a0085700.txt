The Workshop on
              Challenges for Theoretical Computer Science will be held on Saturday, May 20,
              2000 at
Portland State University during the Symposium on the Theory of
              Computing.

In this workshop, the participants will survey the many
              challenging directions open to theoretical computer
science at the beginning
              of the 21st Century. What are the areas in which theory can have, is having,
              might
have an impact?  The Workshop will cover a full range of opportunities,
              from gaining new understanding of the
fundamental mechanisms and limitations
              of computing to impacting science, information technology, and
commerce. A
              report of the deliberations at the workshop will be prepared and distributed to
              the theoretical
computer science community and interested scientists and
              engineers.
