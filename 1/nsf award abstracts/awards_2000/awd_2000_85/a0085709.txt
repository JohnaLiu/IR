Abstract    :
              This grant provides for general support towards the organization and expansion
              of JETS National Engineering Design Challenge (NEDC) through the partnering
              with the Disney Discover Magazine Awards for Technological Innovation.  NEDC is
              a national program, which provides an actual engineering design activity for
              high school students working in teams.  The national winner will be
              participating in the highly visible Discover Awards ceremony in late June with
              a full-page ad on NEDC and JETS appearing in the July issue of Discover
              Magazine.

If successful, the added visibility will increase the awareness of
              NEDC among its core constituents and help in the recruitment of teachers,
              students and engineering mentors who will participate in the program in the
              2000-2001 school year.  This will help address the goals of NEDC which are to
              increase interest in engineering among the high school student population,
              increase student ability to apply scientific and mathematical concepts to real
              problems, give students first hand knowledge about engineering through the link
              with the engineering advisor, and promote interest in engineering to the
              general public
