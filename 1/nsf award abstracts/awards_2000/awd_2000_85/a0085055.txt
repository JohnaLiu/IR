Abstract    :
              
The School District of Philadelphia (SDP) proposes to advance significantly
              the science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) education of all K-12 students
              through the Philadelphia Urban Systemic Program (PHUSP). The PHUSP goals
              parallel those of the USP that seeks: (1) to improve student achievement in
              science and mathematics; (2) to advance the implementation of mathematics and
              science education reform in the District; (3) to increase the competency and
              diversity of teachers and administrators; and (4) to promote collaborations
              with colleges and universities.

The SDP proposes to accomplish this task by
              building on the existing infrastructure developed by reform efforts that began
              in 1995 concomitantly with the awarding of the Urban Systemic Initiative.  The
              foundational tenets include a strong preK-12 leadership team, a standards-based
              curriculum for science and mathematics based on the SDP Curriculum Frameworks,
              Content Standards, and Benchmarks.  

The core structure is also
              characterized by a state-driven school accountability plan, and policy changes
              that increase graduation requirements for science and mathematics,
              recertification mandates for teachers and principals, and the teaching of SMT
              at grades preK-12.  The infrastructure also features converged fiscal and
              intellectual resources, and significant external support for the implemented
              curriculum from multiple institutions of higher education, business partners,
              and the community.

State, district, and classroom data are being used
              extensively to inform and drive change supported by research and evaluative
              studies and surveys from local and national experts. 
An array of
              instructional materials supports the implemented curricula that have embedded
              technology, integration of disciplines, community links, problem-based
              instruction, and writing across the disciplines.
