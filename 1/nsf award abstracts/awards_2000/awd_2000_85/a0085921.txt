              Technology Research: Investigation of a Model for Online Resource Creation and
              Sharing in Educational Settings

The advent of widely accessible networked
              computer technology has opened
new avenues for educators, yet the creation of
              appropriate resources for
this medium is extremely time and effort intensive. 
              To truly become more
effective than a textbook, a resource needs to take
              advantage of its medium
by being interactive and part of a learner-centered,
              adaptable and
individualizing whole.  This research project is designed to
              address
questions of resource pooling and sharing across content areas. 
              The
investigators will incubate multi-institutional collaboration and
              bring
together stakeholders to address content issues such as
              reuse,
customization, online community building, quality, and effectiveness. 
              An
existing software system under development will be used as a model
              to
support the formation and study of an online collaborative
              community,
including workshops, conferences, support, evaluation, and
              dissemination.
