Abstract    :
                   The investigator and his colleagues organize a workshop to
explore
              opportunities in robotics for synergistic collaborations
among engineers,
              computer scientists, and mathematicians.  The
workshop brings together
              engineers, computer scientists, and
mathematicians to discuss examples of
              research needs in robotics,
to look for common themes, and to explore new
              ideas, rooted in
mathematics, that could advance this area.  A major product
              of the
workshop is a report that summarizes the present state of the art
and
              that lays out future opportunities for collaborative
research.
     Robotics
              is concerned with the design of mechanical
manipulators, the systems needed to
              control them, and various
applications such as materials handling, assembly,
              exploration in
extreme environments, prosthetics, and minimally
              invasive
surgery.  For their solution, problems in robotics have
              drawn
heavily on techniques and ideas from engineering and computer
science. 
              It is becoming apparent that progress on significant
open problems requires
              greater involvement of modern mathematics.
This workshop combines engineers,
              computer scientists, and
mathematicians in a joint exploration of needs and
              opportunities
in robotics.  The workshop report is expected to stimulate
              both
new interactions among researchers and new insights and
approaches to
              this important class of problems.
