Abstract    :
              0085137
We will  address remodeling in trabecular bone from a mechanical
              viewpoint. 
In order to understand how mechanical factors contribute to this
              process we 
will predict local stress and strain fields at the cellular level
              where 
bone remodeling takes place. In particular we are interested in
              differences 
between healthy and osteoporotic bones. By knowing local fields
              in these 
two types of bone, under the same external loads, we hope to
              determine 
relations between mechanical load and bone remodeling in healthy
              and 
osteoporotic bone. Our analysis will account for the hierarchical nature
              of 
bone and will involve both theory and experiments.
