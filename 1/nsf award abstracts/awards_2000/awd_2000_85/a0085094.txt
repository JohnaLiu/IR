Abstract    :
              The Phoenix area is comprised of one 9-12 high school district with 23,000
              students, and 13 K-8 elementary districts with over 100,000 students.  The
              Phoenix Union High School District proposes the implementation of the Phoenix
              Pilot 2000 project, an outgrowth of the Phoenix Urban Systemic Program proposal
              (NSF-0085094), to enhance the existing K-12 science and mathematics learning
              infrastructure by effectively integrating the 14 school districts into a
              structure with the greatest potential to improve student achievement.  The
              goals of the proposed 12-month effort are:

1. To increase enrollment and
              student success in college preparatory mathematics and science.

2. To
              provide K-12 standards-based staff development opportunities for mathematics
              and science teachers in collaboration with the Arizona State University.

3.
              To implement K-12 standards-based mathematics and science curricula.

4. To
              increase parent involvement and awareness of the importance of student success
              in mathematics, science, and technology.

5. To evaluate program
              implementation and student achievement in mathematics and science.

In order
              to accomplish these goals, the 14 school districts will be organized into five
              clusters for effectiveness and efficiency.  Each cluster will consist of a high
              school and its nearest elementary schools.  Although the cluster formation will
              provide all school districts with opportunities to address each of the project
              goals, Phoenix Pilot 2000 will focus on the following three clusters:

1.
              Alhambra High School with the Alhambra Elementary District

2. Camelback High
              School with Balsz, Creighton, and Madison Elementary Districts

3. Carl
              Hayden High School with Isaac, Murphy, and Riverside Elementary
              Districts

High school and elementary science and mathematics teachers will
              participate in seminars and discussions with emphasis on the implementation of
              high-quality, standards-based instructional programs and the delivery of
              effective curricula.  A total of four lead teachers (two mathematics and two
              science lead teachers), in conjunction with the Arizona State University, will
              provide support to classroom teachers, ensure the K-8 to 9-12 transition of
              mathematics and science curricula, and conduct staff development activities
              that focus on standards-based curricula, instruction, and student performance
              assessment.

Additional major components of the Phoenix project include a
              three-week algebra summer program eight grade students; and parent involvement
              through quarterly meetings, newsletters, and workshops.
