Polymer materials are often used as biomedical devices that come
              in contact with human blood, of which platelets are a component.  Platelet
              adhesion onto materials incorporated in prosthetic and extracorporeal
              circulatory devices can hinder mass-transport of chemical species or lead to
              life-threatening emboli (blood clots).  Although several materials have been
              developed to minimize platelet adhesion, complete inhibition has not always
              occurred and the potential formation of dangerous blood clots still exists. 
              

The proposed project will optimize and characterize novel polymers that
              utilize endogenous sources (naturally occurring within the body) of nitric
              oxide to inhibit the deposition of platelets.  Nitric oxide is a simple
              biological molecule generated in vivo by many cells, including those that line
              the blood vessels, and is involved in the inhibition of platelet adhesion and
              aggregation.  The polymers will be modified with various chemicals that will
              "extract" nitric oxide from circulating blood components, following which the
              nitric oxide will be released from the polymer to inhibit platelet adhesion.
              

A polymer that is continually capable of inhibiting platelet adhesion for
              long time periods, such as the one(s) optimized in this study, would be
              valuable for long-term applications of polymers exposed to blood.  In addition,
              the concepts demonstrated in this proposal could be applied to minimize
              platelet deposition to non-polymeric materials or polymers not currently used
              that would have beneficial properties in blood-exposure applications.
