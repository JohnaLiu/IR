Abstract    :
              Time sensitive data and field information, records of constructed facility
              performance, and institutional action related to emergency response and
              recovery during the Kocaeli (August 17, 1999) and Duzce (November 12, 1999)
              earthquakes will be collected and organized under a spatially based framework. 
              The research work will be implemented through the coordinated effort of teams
              of U.S. and Turkish scientists, engineers and earthquake professionals.  The
              research work is part of a larger research program with an overall long-term
              objective to develop a spatial based analytical approach to facilitate the
              integrated assessment of emergency preparedness, response, and recovery for
              earthquakes.
