Abstract    :
              This collaborative research will examine atmosphere-biosphere interactions, a
              key component of the Earth's physical system. Understanding this interaction is
              crucial to improve general circulation models, as well as to monitor variations
              in the carbon budget. The PIs will combine models and techniques produced in
              previously funded projects, with surface vegetation data sets, surface energy
              balance and carbon flux data, and new remote sensing products. They will
              further develop the physical interpretation of the first appearance of spring
              foliage commonly called the 'green wave' in the mid-latitudes. The results will
              allow the development of a time line that interconnects various atmospheric and
              biospheric changes associated with the green wave phenomena. Baseline 30-year
              normals and 20th century change assessments of the timing of the onset of
              spring across mid-latitude locations will serve as references for future
              research. The work is important because it will demonstrate the critical roles
              that surface phenological and meteorological data play in atmosphere-biosphere
              simulations and for global change monitoring, when used in concert with
              satellite-derived bioclimatological data.
