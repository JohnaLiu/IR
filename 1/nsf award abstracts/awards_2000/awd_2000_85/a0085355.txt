This project is based on the assumption that the polymerase
              chain reaction can be driven by changes in hydrostatic pressure at constant
              temperature. The PI and co-workers will examine each step of the cycle to
              determine its compatibility with the hydrostatic pressure and temperature
              necessary to maintain helicity and enzyme activity at an elevated temperature
              and strand separation at low pressure.  The pressure-driven procedure would
              provide an alternative to conventional PCR with some advantages - more rapid
              transition between stages of the cycle, unlimited processing volume, simplified
              assurance of processing uniformity, and perhaps different sequence
              restrictions.

The project will proceed through measuring the dependence of
              DNA helicity on temperature, pressure, and composition of the medium. 
              Initially the PI and co-PI will follow in detail the progress of a single cycle
              using DNA templates of well characterized thermal stability and domain
              structure and determine the relation of the parameters of each domain structure
              to pressure.  They will use a simple temperature- and pressure-controlled cell,
              to be constructed at MIT, equipped for spectrophotometric measurement of UV
              absorbance and fluorescent emission of specific labels.  The function of
              appropriate DNA polymerases will be explored with respect to physical
              parameters and some aspects of medium composition that affect protein stability
              and enzyme activity.
