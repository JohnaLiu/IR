Abstract    :
              This project is developing a prototype information infrastructure that
              integrates high quality, focused, and well-maintained collections with an
              intelligent, interactive, and community-based user interface to assist teachers
              in developing powerful science and mathematics instruction for the secondary
              classroom. The collaboration of one of the nation's largest university-based
              teacher preparation programs with the leadership of the Merit Network is
              specifically addressing the needs and developmental perspectives of pre-service
              teachers in their preparation of instructional strategies and use of
              standards-based materials. Project activities include the collection of
              materials for understanding and implementing science and mathematics curriculum
              at grades 6-12 by locating and, where necessary, archiving exemplar materials,
              with a particular focus on the needs of pre-service teachers. In addition, the
              PI and team are addressing interoperability among existing information
              resources, including online clearinghouses and traditional library catalog
              collections. Finally, the project is establishing a user community to build,
              share, and review resources that promote engaged learning in the context of
              state and national curriculum standards. Significant co-funding of this project
              is being provided by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the NSF
              Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences in particular recognition of
              the important K-12 teacher preparation and professional development aspects of
              this work.
