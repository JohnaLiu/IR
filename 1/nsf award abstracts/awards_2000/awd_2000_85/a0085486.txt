Dr. Mitchell Sogin of the Marine Biological
              Laboratory at Woods Hole, MA has been awarded a grant to study the adaptation
              of eukaryotic microorganisms to extremely acidic environments.  Studies of life
              in extreme environments rarely focus upon eukaryotic microbes. Yet there is
              clear evidence that protists inhabit and sometimes dominate ecosystems that are
              either very acidic or very alkaline. A particularly interesting system is the
              Rio Tinto, a river basin in southwestern Spain. This is an acidic environment
              where the pH ranges from 1.7-2.5 and iron concentrations are as high as 20
              mg/ml. The river does not directly support multi-cellular animals but it is
              teeming with eukaryotic microbes, sometimes representing as much as 65% of the
              biomass. The goal of this proposal is to define protist diversity in the Rio
              Tinto and to explore alterations in physiological mechanisms that might allow
              the growth of eukaryotic microbes in this extreme environment. Sogin's team
              will use a combination of culturing and molecular techniques to estimate
              protist diversity. Molecular studies of gene sequences that have been isolated
              from the Rio Tinto biofilm samples will provide estimates of protist diversity.
              These will be compared to the diversity of protists that can be brought into
              culture. They will also use the culture isolates to explore natural variation
              in physiological properties that underlie the stability of acidophilic protist
              populations. We will determine what modifications to existing eukaryotic
              mechanisms are necessary for growth at extremely low pH and how eukaryotes have
              adapted to extreme acid environments.
