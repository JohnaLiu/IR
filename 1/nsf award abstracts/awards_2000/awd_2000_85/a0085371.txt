Abstract    :
              
	This project involves both microbiologists and geologists who will attempt to
              isolate live microorganisms from extremely old (5 million years and older) salt
              crystals.  The program will develop methods to identify those geological
              formations most likely to contain crystals with surviving life forms.  This
              project is a continuation and expansion of a successful, exploratory LExEn
              Project (Paleobiology of Ancient Salt Formations: Examination of Primary
              Crystals for Trapped Biological Materials, NSF Award # EAR 9714203) during
              which the investigators isolated the worlds oldest living bacterium (250
              million years old) from an ancient sodium chloride crystal.  The current
              project has four main goals.  First, to develop new methods and media to
              isolate, quantify and analyze ancient microbes trapped in NaCl crystals. 
              Second, to improve understanding of life and the paleoenvironment at the time
              the crystals formed.  Third to expand the use of non-contaminating methods for
              sample recovery.  Fourth, to train graduate and undergraduate students for
              future interdisciplinary work with microbes from extreme environments. This
              project is based on the hypothesis that small numbers of bacteria, trapped in
              the stable environment of a salt crystal, can survive for extremely long
              periods of time.  The Principal Investigator's laboratory has been involved in
              the study of extremely halophilic Archaea associated with salt crystals for
              over ten years.  The Project Director has published ten refereed articles on
              this topic since 1991.  The project will obtain salt crystals that range in age
              from modern hypersaline environments to Early Miocene (20-24 Ma), Early/Middle
              Eocene (ca. 50 Ma), Late Permian (ca. 250 Ma), and Late Silurian age (408- 421
              Ma).  The data produced will describe the state of evolution and the
              environment in which these crystals originally formed.  The investigators will
              also complete the description of the 250 million year old bacteria they have
              already isolated from Permian aged crystals.
