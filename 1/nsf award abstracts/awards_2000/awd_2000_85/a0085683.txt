Abstract    :
              This award, made under the Exploratory Research on Engineering the Transport
              Industries (ETI) program solicitation, provides funding to identify important
              forces, trends and opportunities in transportation and logistics resulting from
              the increasing presence of the Internet and information technologies.  One
              opportunity, using flexible pricing and bidding strategies to improve
              transportation and logistics efficiencies, will be studied in detail.  The
              challenge is that most practical bidding systems possess a variety of
              complications, like uncertain demands, sequential bidding systems and
              conditional bids, which current models and algorithms are unable to handle
              efficiently.  

The results of this grant will include:  (1) a survey of
              emerging practices in the transportation and logistics industry, cataloging
              among other things, the types (and timeliness) of information available to
              buyers and sellers of transportation services, the levels of integration among
              suppliers, producers and carriers, and the degrees of coordination between
              elements of the value chain; (2) a summary of the important emerging
              opportunities and the associated research problems in the transportation and
              logistics industry, serving as a potential roadmap for future research efforts
              in this domain; and (3) a case study (involving the development of a new
              optimization model and a solution approach) showcasing an important trend in
              the industry and characterizing the potential responses and implications.  With
              the development and application of new theory, the major changes occurring in
              transportation can be exploited to improve transportation and logistics
              efficiencies significantly, for carriers and shippers.
