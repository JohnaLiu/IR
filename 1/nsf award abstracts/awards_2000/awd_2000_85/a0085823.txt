Abstract    :
              This project is creating a National Virtual Teacher Resource Center (NVTRC) that
              focuses on a collection of resources for two-year and four-year Colleges of
              Arts and Sciences and Colleges of Education faculty members who teach science
              and mathematics undergraduate courses. The NVTRC is a collaboration between the
              Ohio State University and the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse, and it expects
              to serve as a hub and focal point for mathematics, science, and technology
              undergraduate teacher education and professional development. The collection of
              the NVTRC focuses primarily on electronic resources including web-based text or
              data resources, software or video that can be downloaded via the web or other
              electronic means, or other emerging technology applications. A review process
              is being established to ensure that the resources are accurate, pedagogically
              effective, and that the NVTRC operates as an efficient source of quality
              materials. Additionally, the NVTRC staff identifies electronic materials at a
              level of specificity or "granularity" not often supported by other web
              searching mechanisms. Finally, a range of digital and human services are
              offered to users of the NVTRC including ready discovery and retrieval of
              materials and information about materials through effective indexing and
              linking, user or third-party reviews/awards linked to items in the collection,
              user registration for additional services such as email notification of new
              resources, and real and virtual reference desk services.
