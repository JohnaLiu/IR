Abstract    :
              Object-oriented programming languages, notably Java, are gaining broad
              use
because of their benefits, which come largely from their flexibility.
              But
this same flexibility makes Java programs more difficult to optimize
              in
advance. One sample collection of programs, optimized in advance,
              spent
40-95% of their time on an aggressive processor waiting for the memory
              to
provide data, illustrating the need to improve memory behavior.
              Future
processors will only make the problem worse.

The project makes an
              integrated attack on this problem, incorporating new
program analyses and
              optimizations, profile feedback, run-time techniques
including adaptive
              garbage collection algorithms, and ways of communicating
high-level
              predictions and observations of program behavior to the
hardware.

The
              project aims to design and build a compiler, run-time system, and
enhanced
              architectural and operating system features that react quickly and
gracefully
              to compiler predictions and actual run-time behavior to achieve
high
              performance. The goal is synergy via cooperation between the system
components
              versus solving each problem within an individual component.

While the
              research focuses on improving memory performance, the project's
envisioned
              framework is suited to a wide range of performance optimization
techniques, so
              the expected research results and software products have
broader impact.
