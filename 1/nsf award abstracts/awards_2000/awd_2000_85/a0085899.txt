Abstract    :
              The problem of attaining peak performance--which has dominated the research
              agenda for the past 20 years--will be secondary to concerns of availability,
              maintainability, and evolutionary growth (AME) in the PostPC era, where
              computers must cope with the flood of new data and yet be much more dependable
              and maintainable. This project develops fault insertion techniques to test for
              graceful recovery from hardware and software failures; self-scrubbing data
              structures that check and repair themselves to improve software reliability;
              and the ability to isolate subsets of live systems to test AME in the field. A
              large-scale prototype is being constructed, with the help of industrial
              partners, to demonstrate these ideas. This research is being carried out in
              collaboration with Matthew Merzbacher of Mills College."
