Abstract    :
              This Polar Instrumentation and Technology Development project will lead to the
              development of a 16 x 16 element array of bolometers with Superconducting
              Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) readout.  The array will be used as an
              imaging device in the focal plane of a submillimeter wavelength telescope at
              South Pole, the Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory
              (AST/RO).   The new detector on AST/RO will be able to make observations much
              faster at wavelengths of a few hundred micrometers than any previous telescope
              arrangement and will permit entirely new astronomy to be done.  The new
              detector array will also be used on other submillimeter telescopes at other
              sites, so it will find broad application.
