Abstract    :
              This is the first year funding of a four-year continuing award.  The proportion
              of elderly in the United States is growing at a phenomenal rate, yet little of
              today's information technology addresses the critical problems that arise as a
              result of this demographic shift.  This project will develop advances in IT to
              address one such challenge, that of enabling the elderly to remain living in
              their homes for as long as possible.   More specifically, the PI and her team
              will design and build a personal mobile robotic assistant for the monitoring
              and guidance of the daily activities of an elderly person.   To achieve that
              vision research will be conducted to advance the state-of-the-art in several
              areas of IT, including:   the development of advanced techniques for flexibly
              reasoning about plans and monitoring their execution;   the development of
              statistical algorithms for learning models of people's daily activities;   the
              design and evaluation of self-tailoring multi-modal interfaces that enable
              elderly people to interact easily with the robotic assistant;   and the
              development of new sensor modalities to meet the needs of a mobile robot in an
              elder's home.  The work will be evaluated along three dimensions:  through
              theoretical and simulation-based evaluations of components, through targeted
              user studies, and through a series of field tests conducted at regular
              intervals throughout the project in the homes of elderly people.  The research
              team is multi-university and interdisciplinary, comprising experts in the
              fields of computer science, robotics, human-computer interaction, and health
              care.  The project also includes a strong education focus in that it seeks to
              provide a unique forum for training undergraduate and graduate students in
              issues related to IT for the elderly.
