Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a one-year Research Opportunity Award to the
              University of Florida to work on a joint research project with the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Corrosion in Multiphase
              Technology at Ohio University.  This interdisciplinary research program will
              focus on inhibitor/steel interactions and its effect on the chemistry and
              morphology of corrosion product layers.
