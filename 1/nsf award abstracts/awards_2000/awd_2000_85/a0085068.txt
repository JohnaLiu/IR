This Americas Program award will fund travel and related
              expenses for a short-term visit to Venezuela by Dr. Ronald D. Neuman, Auburn
              University, Alabama, to plan, with his collaborator, Dr. Orlando J. Rojas, of
              the Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Los Andes, Venezuela, the
              establishment of a research program in the fundamental and practical aspects of
              interfacial phenomena. 

The facilities and expertise's in heavy crude oil
              emulsions and foams of the Universidad de los Andes group and this expertise of
              the Principal Investigators in experimental measurements of interfacial
              properties of surfactant systems to do well for international cooperation,
              which may involve both faculty and graduate and undergraduate students at the
              two academic institutions.
