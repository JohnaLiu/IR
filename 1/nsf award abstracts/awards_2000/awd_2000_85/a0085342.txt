Abstract    :
              Mata de Platano is a 53 ha reserve within a large area set aside for
              conservation. Originally established by an environmental organization, Mata de
              Platano is now managed by Inter American University of PR. Located in the
              northern karst belt of Puerto Rico on the West Indies, Mata de Platano lies
              within the largest unfragmented and most diverse forest in the island.
              Twenty-two percent of the island population uses ground water that originates
              in this karst belt, and the region is considered wilderness in terms of its
              geomorphic, ecological, and subterranean features. Nevertheless, the area has
              received less attention from a scientific point of view than the wet forest in
              the igneous soils of eastern Puerto Rico. The major reason for this unbalanced
              examination of ecosystems is the lack of a field station capable of providing
              much needed infrastructure for the pursuit of long term ecological
              studies.

Mata de Platano Nature Reserve contains within its premises a
              standing concrete structure that will be restored using funds from this award
              in order to establish a center capable of sustaining long-term research and
              educational activities. The establishment of this field station will greatly
              improve our knowledge of karst forests; increase the availability of research
              experience for students, including low income minority students; and as an
              added value will contribute towards the conservation of forests with high
              biotic diversity.
