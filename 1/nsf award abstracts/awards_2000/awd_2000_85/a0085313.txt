Abstract    :
              The 21 September 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake caused widespread damage and disruption
              to the transportation system throughout central Taiwan. Bridges in the
              epicentral region experienced severe ground motion and in many cases large
              fault offset.  The thorough investigation of bridges in the earthquake will
              help reduce the seismic risk of the highway system in the United States.  The
              two countries use similar structural systems for bridges and, as in Taiwan,
              large fault movement is expected in the western U.S.  This project involves
              collecting data on damaged and collapsed bridges in Taiwan and analyzing the
              data to evaluate bridge performance.  The tasks of the project are to: (1)
              document damage of bridges; (2) correlate fault movement and strong ground
              motion records with observed damage; (3) develop models for nonlinear dynamic
              analysis of selected bridges to assess performance and damage modes; (4)
              identify the factors affecting performance; (5) develop recommendations for
              U.S. specifications for seismic design of bridges; (6) develop recommendations
              for specific research needs; (7) publish findings in a report and on the World
              Wide Web, including access to databases.  Of particular interest for
              investigation are bridges built after 1980, including the Mao-loh-shi viaduct
              bridge and the Ji-lu cable-stayed bridge.
