Abstract    :
              This project is developing tools and processes for the quality control of
              digital learning materials, using a model based on building and sustaining
              communities of individual and institutional users and contributors,
              professional discipline organizations, and publishers of education materials.
              The effort leverages the work of the Multimedia Educational Resource for
              Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT) Initiative which has a growing collection
              of over 2,000 digital learning materials. Over twenty higher education
              institutions - led by the California State University System, the University of
              Georgia System, the University of North Carolina System, and the University of
              Oklahoma System - are forming discipline communities in biology, chemistry,
              physics, and engineering mathematics to develop standards and processes for
              implementing and sustaining mechanisms for peer review of digital learning
              materials. Additional discipline communities are expected to form as the
              project evolves. Discussion, debate, and communication take place via MERLOT's
              web-based worksites where members of the virtual communities collaborate.
              Institutional participants are supporting their faculty's endeavors through
              stipends and/or reassigned time and travel allotments for attending the MERLOT
              sponsored workshops and conferences.
