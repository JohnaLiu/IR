Abstract    :
              One of the most challenging requirements for the study of life in extreme
              environments is studying the organisms inhabiting these environments in situ,
              and understanding the unique aspects of biological life and adaptations
              required for survival.  The Antarctic marine psychrophiles provide an excellent
              model group of extreme microorganisms for this work, since very little is known
              about their biological and functional diversity, or specific metabolic
              adaptations to life at -1.8 degree C.  The overall goal of this research is the
              development of genomic approaches for studying microorganisms sampled directly
              from extreme environments and thus, circumventing the requirement for
              cultivation.  The objectives of the proposed work are (1) to sequence six large
              bacterial genomic DNA fragments isolated directly from Antarctic marine
              psychrophiles; (2) to construct two different types of DNA microarrays designed
              to identify genes being actively expressed in uncultivated microorganisms
              living in the sub-zero marine waters of the Antarctic; (3) to optimize specific
              aspects of microarray technology for use with environmental samples; and 4) to
              develop a transferable methodology that will be useful for other researchers in
              accessing gene expression information directly from the natural environment. 
              The proposed study will make use of an Antarctic genomic DNA library comprised
              of large (40 kb) genomic fragments of planktonic archaeal and bacterial DNA
              created in earlier studies to develop targeted and shotgun DNA microarrays. The
              application of DNA microarray technology to studies of life in extreme
              environments offers an outstanding opportunity for identifying new genes for
              biotechnological use.  Discovering specific adaptations to extreme environments
              by detecting genes that are uniquely expressed in the natural environment is an
              ultimate goal of the research.
