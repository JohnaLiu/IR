Abstract    :
              0002754 Prater
The cause for the observed coincidence of enhanced biological
              activity in the vicinity of shelfbreak fronts will be investigated by a series
              of field experiments in the Middle Atlantic Bight. The hypotheses to be tested
              are both physical and biological. First the convergence of buoyancy flux in the
              bottom boundary layer drives upwelling of nutrient rich Shelf Water along the
              shoreward side of the shelfbreak front. Second, the biological activity is
              enhanced due to this large flux nutrient and by optimal optical conditions as
              the water transitions from turbid shelf water to clear oceanic water, making
              the front a region with high photosynthetic efficiency. Five new technologies
              (dye tracer, isopycnal floats, pumped Seasoar with high speed chemical
              analysis, towed microstructure instrument and use of optical variability to
              estimate photosynthetic properties of phytoplankton) will used in three 10-dy
              cruises to track the front in a Lagrangian framework.
