This proposal expresses the intent of Texas A&M
              University (TAMU) to join the Power Systems Engineering Research Center
              (PSerc).  To emphasize this intent, the following issues are discussed: 
              benefits of TAMU's participation in PSerc, benefits of participation of TAMU's
              industry partners, proposed research areas, proposed research projects, TAMU's
              support of the proposal, and site director credentials.  The main objective of
              TAMU's participation in PSerc is to enhance research capabilities of both PSerc
              and TAMU.  This will in turn provide the research infrastructure that will
              serve better PSerc industry partners as well as the public at large as the
              benefactors of the developments in the industrial base.
