Abstract    :
              This project investigates the cognitive learning styles of heterogeneous,
              distributed software agents to uncover how they best learn, discover how other
              agents learn and take advantage of the various learning capabilities. The
              objectives of this research project are to 1) identify the various styles of
              multi-agent learning, 2) develop a multi-agent learning framework, and 3)
              conduct experiments on multi-agent learning. This research project will advance
              our understanding of agent information and knowledge sharing.
