Abstract    :
              Ortiz-0002854		

Using in vitro and in vivo biochemical techniques, we will
              investigate the molecular components of a novel transcriptional control element
              that suppresses position-effect-variegation in transgenic mice.  This element
              functions in all tissues analyzed and is a sub-element of the locus control
              region of the T-cell receptor a/d gene locus.
