Partial support is provided for US participants in a NATO
              Advanced Study Institute (ASI) to be held in Hungary during August 13-25 of
              2000.  The ASI is on "Fundamentals of and Bridging the Gap Between Macro- and
              Micro/Nanoscale Tribology".  It is designed to encourage interactions between
              researchers from Eastern Europe and the West for the purpose of exploring new
              frontiers of research, exchange information, and discuss potential
              collaborative efforts.  It will also provide an opportunity for new researchers
              to become aware of research and educational opportunities in a broad spectrum
              of specialties within the field.
