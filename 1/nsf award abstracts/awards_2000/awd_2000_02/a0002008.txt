Continental
              extension is a fundamental geologic process that results in crustal thinning,
              basin development, and can ultimately lead to continental breakup and
              development of passive continental margins and ocean basins.  This project will
              utilize a well-studied detachment fault in Arizona and Nevada to investigate
              several aspects of normal faulting including the uplift and exhumation history
              of the lower plate relative to displacement and the extent to which upper and
              lower plate processes are coupled.  The work involves an integrated structural,
              fission track and paleomagnetic study.  Results are expected to contribute to a
              better understanding of how major normal fault systems evolve through time.
