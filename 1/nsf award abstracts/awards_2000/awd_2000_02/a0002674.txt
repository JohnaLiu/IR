Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the seismic structure of oceanic mantle
              lithosphere using an active-source seismic refraction experiment along an
              800-km-long transect in the Western Atlantic Ocean.  The transect extends along
              a plate kinematic flow line that lies entirely within a single spreading-center
              segment, on lithosphere ranging from 87 to 145 million years old.  The
              experiment will determine if the lithospheric mantle in the Atlantic is
              stratified, the magnitude and form of anisotropy over length scales of a few
              hundred kilometers, the constraints the character of oceanic Pn coda places on
              the nature of small-scale lateral heterogeneity, and the parameters that
              maximize the range at which mantle phases can be recorded using airgun source
              and ocean-bottom receivers.
