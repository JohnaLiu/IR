Abstract    :
              NSF Funding is requested to conduct a Workshop by assembling a group of
              practicing engineers, university faculty, and government professionals
              specializing in cold regions engineering, dividing them into interest groups,
              and allowing them to collectively identify and elucidate specific research
              topics and describe needed research work which should be performed at the
              beginning of this millennium.  It is proposed that the Workshop be held at the
              University of Alaska-Anchorage campus to minimize the costs to conduct the
              Workshop and mazimize the participation from the cold regions engineering
              professionals community.  The deliverable from the Workshop will be a report to
              NSF, which will subsequently be distributed to the participants at the
              Workshop, other cold regions engineering professionals who were not able to
              attend, and appropriate federal agencies.  The report will hopefully guide
              research efforts in the cold regions engineering community, encourage faculty
              members to write research proposals to conduct needed research, and direct
              federal and state agencies to fund research proposals which relate to research
              needs identified in the report.
