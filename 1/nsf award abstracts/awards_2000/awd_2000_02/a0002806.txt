Abstract    :
                   Biological functions are dictated by the shapes and movements of
              macromolecules.  Understand and modulating biological systems therefore
              requires the ability to determine the structures and dynamics of macromolecules
              in solution.  To facilitate such studies, the University of Utah has recently
              built and staffed a new Center for Biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. 
              The Center provides NMR resources for research groups studying structural
              aspects of HIV assembly, RNA biochemistry, DNA transcription, chromatin
              organization, natural product chemistry, metalloprotein function, intracellular
              signaling, protein folding and macromolecular trafficking.  NMR Center
              management is provided by two co-directors, who oversee a lab manager and a
              service technician.  Management polices are evaluated on a semi-annual basis by
              a faculty advisory committee to ensure that the facility runs efficiently and
              equitably.
     This award supports the purchase of a Varian INOVA 600 NMR
              spectrometer to be housed in the Center.  Biomolecular structure determinations
              currently being performed will benefit greatly from the increased sensitivity
              and dispersion realized in increasing the available field strength from 500 to
              600 MHz, as well as with the new state of the art electronic and hardware
              capabilities of the INOVA 600. 
     The bulk of the NMR instrument time will
              be allotted to four major and six minor user groups who are drawn from seven
              different academic departments at the University of Utah.  Thus, in addition to
              its utility as a research instrument, the INOVA 600 NMR spectrometer will
              facilitate training in structural biology for a large group of graduate
              students and postdoctoral associates doing research in many different aspects
              of the biomedical sciences.
