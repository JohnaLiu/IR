Abstract    :
              This grant provides partial funding for a Material Handling Research Colloquium
              (MHRC).  The goal for MHRC 2000 is to bring together researchers with industry
              participants to address material handling in the context of the National
              Research Council's report, Visionary Manufacturing Challenges for 2020.  St.
              Onge Company is the host for the Colloquium, and major funding is provided from
              industry through the Material Handling Industries of America.

The impact of
              the Material Handling Research Colloquium will be felt in several ways.  First,
              by providing a focused, intimate setting for researchers to present and discuss
              their latest work, the Colloquium will speed the dissemination of state of the
              art ideas and results within the research community.  Second, by providing a
              forum for industry and the research community to address the challenges of the
              next twenty years, the Colloquium will significantly impact the direction of
              future research.  The proceedings of the Colloquium will include not only the
              research papers presented, but also summaries of the breakout sessions
              addressing future research needs.
