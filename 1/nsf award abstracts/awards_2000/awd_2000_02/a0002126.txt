Abstract    :
                    Education Development Center, Inc. proposes to refine and offer -- along
              with WestEd, TERC, IDRA, and Eisenhower Clearinghouse -- the online gender
              equity course for middle school math and science teachers entitled "Engaging
              Middle School Girls in Math and Science."  Utilizing a qualitative methodology,
              we will research over a two-year period the impact of this training on
              participants' attitudes and practices, among other things, identifying key
              aspects of course design and delivery that aid in positive impacts.
     This
              project will provide vital data on the effectiveness of one type of online
              gender equity training, as well as the suitability of various aspects of gender
              equity training to this delivery format.  It will also strengthen
              infrastructure by building a community of math and science teachers trained in
              gender equity who communicate and support each other as they translate a
              critical framework into strategies and activities for classroom change.  The
              leadership development aspect of the course will begin a process of wider
              institutionalization.  Finally, the project will build on current networks,
              working to create new conversations that will evolve over time and make the
              necessary linkages among math and science, gender equity, and educational
              technology professionals.
