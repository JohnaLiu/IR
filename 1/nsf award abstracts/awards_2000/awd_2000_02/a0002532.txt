Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Brazil award will support a symposium-workshop on Frugivory and Seed
              Dispersal in August 6-12, 2000 in Pousada do Rio Quente, Brazil. The award
              includes funding for travel and subsistence for 15 US delegates from 14
              different US institutions to the symposium-workshop. 

This is the third in a
              series of workshops on this topic, the previous two held in 1985 and 1991 in
              Mexico, resulted in a number of publications that shaped the development of the
              relatively new field. Additionally, Dr. Douglas J. Levey will conduct a planned
              visit to meet with Drs. Wesley Silva and Mauro Galetti to finalize logistics
              for the symposium-workshop.

Understanding the role of seed dispersers in
              plant demography and the role of fruit in vertebrate population dynamics is an
              important component of conservation strategies. In parts of the world, most
              woody plants produce fruit and depend upon vertebrates to disperse their seeds.
              Estimates of vertebrate biomass supported by fruit resources are as high as
              80%.  Aside from its practical importance, fruit-frugivore interactions
              represent one of the two major plant-animal mutualisms (the other being
              pollution). Its theoretical development has been influential in shaping views
              of co evolution, partially because its previous theoretical framework proved
              incorrect. Its current theoretical framework is in a state of uncertain
              transition. Thus now is a critical time for people in the field to meet, share
              ideas, establish collaborations, and settle upon a future course of action. The
              proceedings of the symposium-workshop will be published.

The selected site
              is known for its biological diversity, and will attract a broad international
              participation, including a large number of Latin American students.
