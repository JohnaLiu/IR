Description:  This award is for support of a cooperative
              project by Dr. William Rundell, Department of Mathematics, Texas A&M University
              (TAMU), College Station, Texas and a Tunisian team led by Dr. Mohamed Jaoua,
              Professor of Applied Mathematics and Director of the Laboratory for
              Mathematical Modeling at the Ecole Nationale D'Ingenieurs De Tunis (ENIT),
              Tunis, Tunisia.  They plan to study inverse and optimal design mathematical
              problems and several of their applications in various fields.  Some of the
              applications to which these mathematical tools will be applied are: impedance
              tomography (in medical applications), acoustic scattering, and the design of
              automobile mufflers. 

Scope:  This award will allow collaboration between
              Tunisian and US scientists who have complementary capabilities and experience
              in the field of applied mathematics.  The Tunisian team includes senior
              researchers, postdoctoral investigators and graduate students.  Both the US and
              Tunisian team leaders have strong publishing records in the area of inverse and
              optimal design problems and in applications in several engineering fields. This
              TAMU-ENIT interaction is likely to be a productive collaboration, with benefits
              to both teams.  This proposal meets the INT objective of encouraging
              collaboration by US and foreign scientists in areas of mutual benefit.
