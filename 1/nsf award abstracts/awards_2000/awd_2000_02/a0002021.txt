This award supports the development of instrumentation and
              techniques to enable the measurement of acoustic wave velocities in minerals
              and other solids at extremely high pressures and temperatures that are
              characteristic of the Earth's deep interior.  The technique will couple the
              laser heated diamond anvil cell with Brillouin spectroscopy.  Development of
              this technology will yield direct information on the seismic velocities in
              materials under conditions that have never before been attained. Experiments
              will be obtained on materials that are thought to be constituents of the
              Earth's deep interior, and the results will be compared with information on the
              velocity structure of the Earth as obtained from seismological
              studies.
Results should yield significant new insights on the chemical
              composition of the Earth at depth, the thermal structure of the Earth, and
              Earth's evolution through time. The facility will allow measurement of the
              physical properties of a variety of solid materials (not just minerals) under
              extreme temperature and pressure conditions, and therefore is poised to make
              significant contributions to the field of materials science as well as earth
              science.  Brillouin scattering measurements will be attempted to temperatures
              of up to 2500 Kelvin, while the sample is simultaneously held at pressures of
              up to 50 GPa.  Initial experiments will concentrate on careful characterization
              of the temperature/pressure environment (including accounting for thermal
              pressure), identifying sources of error in the method, and developing
              techniques for making the most accurate measurements possible.
