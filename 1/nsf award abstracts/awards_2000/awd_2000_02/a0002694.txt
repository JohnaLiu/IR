Abstract    :
              The Astronomical Society of the Pacific, in collaboration with the Astronomical
              League and Sky and Telescope Magazine, will survey amateur astronomers to
              determine which informal audiences they serve and what types of support
              materials would encourage them to do more and better outreach, and to test a
              prototype set of outreach support materials.  Amateur astronomers, estimated to
              number 300,000 to 500,000, represent a large and mostly untapped source of
              expertise and enthusiasm for conducting educational outreach activities in the
              community and in schools.
