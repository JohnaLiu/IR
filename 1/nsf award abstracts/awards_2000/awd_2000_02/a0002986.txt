The PI's proposed to apply both the finite element and
              experimental methods to study the effect of underfill/die or
              underfill/substrate adhesion on the solder joint reliability of flip chip
              packages.  This work will be a collaborative effort between researchers at the
              Tuskegee University Center for Advanced Materials and Auburn University Center
              for Advanced Vehicle Electronics.  For the finite element methods, two
              conditions, namely, strongly-bonded and weakly-bonded interfaces will be
              considered.  The weakly-bonded interface will be modeled using a set of gap
              elements at the interface.  For modeling the strong interface, a common set of
              nodes will be employed at the interface which will be shared by both the
              constituent materials.  Results for the die stresses at the underfill
              interfaces will be correlated with the test chip sensor measurements.  Also,
              the cycles to failure of the solder joints will be predicted using finite
              element method due to cyclic thermal loads.
