Recommended project is for a series of
              seismic experiments to be conducted from boreholes during Ocean Drilling
              Program (ODP) Leg 198 to map occurrences of gas hydrate and free gas in
              sediments on Hydrate Ridge offshore Oregon.  These experiments will
              geophysically extend observations from direct core description, direct core
              measurement, and borehole logging into the surrounding sediments, thereby
              provide 3-D coverage of inferred gas hydrate and free gas occurrence over a
              much larger sediment volume.  The experiments include: 1) constant-offset
              vertical seismic profiling (VSP) with a fixed source receiver, coordinated with
              zero-offset VSP's, which will result in vertically continuous shear-wave
              velocity (Vs) profiles; 2) walkaway VSP's, acquired by shooting over the
              borehole with a second ship to a receiver at fixed depth within the borehole,
              thereby acquiring high-quality Vs and compressional wave (Vp) data to calibrate
              rock physics models of gas-hydrate bearing sediments; 3) deployment of ocean
              bottom seismometers in a dense array around one of the boreholes for dense 3-D
              seismic coverage to examine an area of inferred focused fluid flux and its
              relationship to a gas hydrate cap; and 4) using the ODP Advanced Piston Corer
              (APC) as a seismic source during piston deployment for a larger array of
              measurements using the OBS array.  These geophysical results will be directly
              tied to drilling results to constrain relationships between fluid flux, free
              gas, and hydrate formation in a convergent margin setting.
