This project tracks the
              emergence of non-governmental social movements in a transitional democratic
              African state.  In particular, the research focuses on women and women's
              organizations in Ghana.  While it is known that some such organizations have
              appeared in Ghana and are working to promote the social positions of women,
              little is known at present about the outcomes of those efforts.  Similarly, it
              is not known why some non-governmental organizations transform themselves to
              social advocacy organizations while others do not.  Research conclusions will
              be based on interviews with over 600 members of women's organizations, and
              multi-variate models of causal chains.
