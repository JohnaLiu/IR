This project will fund an Albert Einstein Fellow to work in
              the Division of Elementary, Secondary and Informal Education of the National
              Science Foundation for eleven months, beginning September 1, 2000.  The precise
              duties and responsibilities of this Fellow will be determined by NSF personnel.
               However, the majority of her time will be devoted to the Presidential Awards
              for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching program.  She will assist
              with the preparation and implementation of the winter conference for state
              coordinators, the national selection committee meeting, the Award Week
              ceremonies and activities, as well as involvement in the day-to-day work of the
              program.  Her involvement in other programs of the Division will depend upon
              her available time, her interests, and the needs of the Division.  The Fellow
              will provide three written reports to the Triangle Coalition, which will
              describe her responsibilities and on-going activities.  These will be used to
              evaluate the Fellows' accomplishments during the Fellowship period and to offer
              personal perspectives and recommendations on the Fellowship program.
