Abstract    :
              This project will develop a suite of geophysical techniques that will improve
              capabilities to integrate quantitatively the results of seismic and geodynamic
              modeling.  The aproach - called geodynamic tomography - is a new form of
              constraint tomography that differs from those previously implemented. 
              Geodynamic models will be mapped into their seismic signature and anisotropic
              tomography will be used to formally test the model against the seismic data. 
              This method will limit the search for acceptable seismic models to a subset
              that are consistent with geodynamic predictions, and will allow rigorous
              testing of the differing geodynamic assumptions against actual
              observations.
