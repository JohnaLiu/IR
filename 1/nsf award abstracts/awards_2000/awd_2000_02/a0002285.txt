This project develops a formal
              theory of exchange behavior under conditions of uncertainty, and provides a
              partial test of the theory using laboratory experiments.  Behavior in exchange
              networks has been studied for many years, and several theories have been
              developed that predict coalitions and point splits quite accurately. Building
              on that work, this theory predicts different strategies for actors in positions
              differing in bargaining power.  It uses ideas from work on uncertainty by
              Kahneman and Tversky.  New mechanisms in this theory are reference dependence,
              diminishing sensitivity, and loss aversion.  All have been widely used in
              theories of games, and this project adapts them to the case of network
              bargaining.  Results will be used to further develop theoretical understanding
              of interrelations of structural power and co-actors behavior in predicting
              bargaining mechanisms and winnings.
