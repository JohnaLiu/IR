Description:  This award in materials research is for
              US-India Cooperative Research: Theoretical Studies on Magnetoresistive Oxides. 
              Professor S.D. Mahanti of Michigan State University and Indian collaborator
              Arghya Taraphder of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur will study
              the electronic structure of magnetoresistive oxides.
The research will focus
              on construction of realistic model systems for manganites and double
              perovskites. They will relate the results of Hartree-Fock calculations to those
              of more tractable theoretical models.  The investigators recognize the
              strengths and limitations of Hartree-Fock and local spin density approximations
              in electronic structure work, and plan to use both to learn what might not be
              learned from either alone.  The results are expected to have wide applicability
              in condensed matter physics. 

Scope:  Oxide materials continue to represent
              a vigorous area of research in the U.S.  The investigators have excellent track
              records, have made many important contributions to the field, and their
              collaboration is likely to lead to broadly interesting results.  The connection
              with the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur is excellent and the
              students at both institutions will benefit from the exchange of scientists. 
              This award is supported jointly with the Government of India's Department of
              Science and Technology.
