This project involves planning and coordination associated
              with the proposed SAFOD (San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth) Project, to
              drill and core deeply into the San Andreas fault zone and conduct a broad range
              of scientific investigations in and around the drillhole  and to utilize the
              hole for long term monitoring of an active plate boundary fault at depth.  Such
              a project will provide fundamental constraints on the structure, composition,
              mechanical behavior and physical state of an active, major plate-boundary
              fault.

1. Coordinate and plan the overall scientific
2. Coordinate site
              selection studies and integrate data into GIS database
3. Convene workshops
              with SAFOD science team
4. Define engineering needs for drilling and borehole
              measurements
5. Develop and promote technology development program
6.
              Initiate (and follow) environmental impact analysis and site  permitting
7.
              Represent project with federall, state and local agencies
8. Coordinate
              outreach to local governments and the public

The SAFOD Project is a
              component of Phase ! of NSF's EarthScope Initiative which is a component of the
              MRE request to Congress in the FY 2001 budget.  These planning activities are
              crucial to the success of EarthScope.
