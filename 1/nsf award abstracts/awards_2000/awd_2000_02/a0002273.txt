              ABSTRACT

OCE-0002273
 
Near the surface, Pb and Fe show a seasonal cycle
              related to the development of the seasonal thermocline and seasonal input
              cycles, and short-term variability related to the atmospheric transport, ocean
              eddies, and biological blooms.  In addition, anthropogenic Pb is entering the
              thermocline and deep ocean as a time-dependent transient tracer.  The temporal
              evolution of Pb isotopes ratios may provide an age tracer of Northern Source
              deep water masses in the deep sea of particular utility in portions of the deep
              South Atlantic, where tritium and CFCs have not yet penetrated.  For this
              reason, the PI will continue collecting samples on a weekly basis using the
              Moored In-Situ Trace Element Serial Sampler (MITESS, time series and deep
              seawater samples) and the Automated Trace Element sampler (ATE, samples up to
              10 m depths).  Results from these sampling efforts will establish monthly means
              and examine the causes of observed variability for Pb and Fe at Bermuda and
              Hawaii, as well as determine whether iron pulses are responsible for
              unexplained blooms at the eastern North Pacific Ocean Station "P".  In
              addition, the PI will collect samples along the flow path of the North Atlantic
              Deep Water (NADW) to document the penetration of anthropogenic Pb into the
              south Atlantic via the NADW, assess whether Pb isotopes can be used as an
              age-dependent source tracer and establish the partitioning of Fe into
              dissolved, colloidal and particulate forms.
