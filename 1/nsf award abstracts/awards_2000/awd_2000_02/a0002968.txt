Abstract    :
              The role of iron (Fe) as a limiting agent of biological productivity in marine
              systems has been studied extensively. Marine prokaryotic organisms are known to
              maintain the ability to produce siderophore (or at least siderophore-like
              compounds) in response to Fe-limiting growth conditions.  While research
              analytical techniques can quantify total Fe at incredibly small concentrations
              and provide information on Fe speciation, we remain without indicators of the
              biological availability of this Fe to natural communities.  To understand the
              role that Fe plays in global marine productivity, tools/techniques for
              quantifying truly bioavailable iron are needed.  Since organisms in aquatic
              systems can determine their own Fe status, a tool based on the Fe sensing
              system of a marine organism would be the best.  The investigators have
              developed a genetically engineered microorganism (GEM) with a luminescent
              reporter that directly responds to Fe bioavailability using the native
              ferric-uptake-regulator (Fur) protein of a marine bacterium.  The researchers
              will now attempt integration of the reporter into ten other strains of marine
              bacteria.  Laboratory experiments will establish the relationship between Fe
              bioavailability and light production.  Field testing of the GEMs as Fe
              bioavailability reporters will be conducted on cruises of opportunity in the
              Sargasso Sea, Lake Erie, and the Peru upwelling region.
