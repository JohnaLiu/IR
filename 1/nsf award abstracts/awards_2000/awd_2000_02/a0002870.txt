Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for a symposium entitled "Environmental Applications
              of Ionizing Radiation" for the purpose of synthesizing the existing knowledge
              on the application of ionizing radiation, gamma radiation and electron beams,
              to environmental treatment processes.  The symposiun will be held in
              conjunction with the 2000 International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin
              Societies (Pacifichem 2000) in December 2000.  The Congress is sponsored
              jointly by the American Chemical Society, the Canadian Society for Chemistry,
              the Chemical Society of Japan, the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry and the
              Royal Australian Chemical Institute.  The symposium, a sequel to the successful
              symposium held during Pacifichem 1995, is being organized by Dr. William J.
              Cooper, University of North Carolina Wilmington.  A major output of the
              symposium will be the identification of research needs in the field of
              environmental applications of ionizing radiation.  This grant will support
              transportation, lodging and registration costs of invited participants from the
              United States.
