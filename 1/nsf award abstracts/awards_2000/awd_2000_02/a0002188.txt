The North America Symposium on Chemical Reaction
              Engineering (NASCRE), to be held in January of 2001, is being planned to
              provide a forum at which academic and industrial experts, especially young
              ones, will be exposed to the frontiers of chemical reaction engineering.  The
              topical meeting will focus on six topics and consist of six plenary and six
              oral presentation sessions.  All oral presentations will be limited to these
              pre-determined six topics; contributions on other topics will be presented in
              two poster sessions.  The six topics will be:

Biochemical reaction
              engineering
Combinatorial catalysis
Fuel cells for stationary and mobile
              applications
Polyolefin reaction engineering
Synthesis gas and chemicals via
              novel reactors
Multi-phase reactors
