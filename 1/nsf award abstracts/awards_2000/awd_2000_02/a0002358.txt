              ABSTRACT

OCE-0002358
 

A three pronged approach is outlined by the PIs to
              document the input and ultimate fate of organic matter in Cape Lookout Bight,
              North Carolina.  In step one, the PIs will collect suspended matter using plate
              traps and surficial sediments to quantify the sources of modern, bomb
              radiocarbon-enriched organic matter, assess whether delivery varies seasonally
              and determine what percentage of the modern carbon from each source survives
              degradation in sulfate reducing and methane producing zones and is buried.  The
              second goal of this project entails understanding the factors that control the
              chemical composition and molecular size distribution in porewater DOC, as well
              as conduct a pulse-tracer experiment to directly observe the flow of carbon
              into and through this DOC pool.   Lastly, the PIs will focus on fermentation
              and terminal metabolism by sulfate reducing and methanogenic bacteria to
              ascertain the processes that consume low molecular weight DOC.
