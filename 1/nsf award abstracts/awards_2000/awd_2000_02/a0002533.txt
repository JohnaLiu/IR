This proposal requests funds to help support
              travel costs of U.S. participants to the 23rd International Conference on
              Mathematical Geophysics.  This year's conference is titled Extreme Earth
              Events.  The conference focuses on systems that display sudden transitions from
              quiescent states to crises, extreme events, catastrophic or disastrous
              instabilities.  Examples range from large natural catastrophes such as
              earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes and tornadoes, landslides,
              avalanches, mass extinctions and catastrophic events of environmental
              degradation, to the failure of engineering structures, crashes in the stock
              market, social unrest and economic disruptions on national and global scales,
              regional power blackouts, traffic gridlock, diseases and epidemics.  The
              purpose of this conference is to provide a forum that allows scientists from a
              full range of scientific disciplines to interact with each other and with
              experts in the math and physics community.
