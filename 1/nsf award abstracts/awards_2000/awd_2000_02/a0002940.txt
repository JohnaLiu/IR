Abstract    :
              The underlying mechanisms that cause low-frequency fluctuations in the skill of
              El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts are not fully understood. The PIs
              will conduct a detailed investigation of the hypothesis that internal
              variability of the atmosphere acts as a stochastic forcing on the coupled
              system, and gives rise to decadal modulations of ENSO. They will perform
              long-term perfect-model scenario forecast experiments, using an intermediate
              coupled model, forced with a variety of noise realizations in a range of
              dynamical regimes. The work is important because it will increase understanding
              of the ENSO system. Improved ability to predict ENSO has major societal
              benefits.
