	This award provides partial funding for the support of a
              technician to oversee operation and maintenance of the gas-source mass
              spectrometry laboratory in the Department of Geosciences at the University of
              Arizona. The mass spectrometers in the laboratory are essential research tools
              for several faculty and their students at the University of Arizona. The
              research dependent on isotopic analyses conducted by this group includes study
              of hydrothermal fluid-rock interactions, igneous petrogenesis, ground water and
              low-temperature fluid-rock interactions, ecology and paleoecology,
              biogeochemistry, and paleontology. The primary responsibilities of the
              technician include operation and maintenance of two mass spectrometers and gas
              extraction lines and training and supervision of users of the facility.
