Abstract    :
                  This project involves the use of numerical chemical transport models to
              study the processes controlling aerosol and chemical distributions in outflow
              from Southeastern Asia.  This project is a component of the ACE-Asia field
              program.  Specific activities will include:  1) comprehensive,
              three-dimensional, regional-scale modeling of aerosol/chemical interactions, 2)
              improvement and enhancement of emission inventories of primary aerosol and
              gaseous precursors needed to conduct detailed chemical/aerosol modeling in the
              region, and 3) providing three-dimensional forecasts of aerosol and trace gas
              distributions in support of the intensive field operations during ACE-Asia.
