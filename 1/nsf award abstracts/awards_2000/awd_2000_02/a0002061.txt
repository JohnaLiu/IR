Description:  This award supports US-India Cooperative
              Research: Application of Carbon Nanotubes in Composites -Alignment and Adhesion
              Problems.  US PI John Fischer, University of Pennsylvania and Rakesh B. Mathur,
              National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi will conduct research on critical
              problemsthat need solutions before nanotubes can be successfully used in high
              strength composites.  The objective is to exploit the exceptional mechanical
              strength of carbon nanotubes for the fabrication of advanced composite
              materials.     

Scope:  The research groups compliment one another and each
              group has highly qualified senior researchers with established research
              records.  Their collaboration is expected to produce advances that increase
              scientific understanding and enhance prospects for technological use of
              nanotube composites.  The project has clear mutual benefits for the US and
              India, as well as potential for industrial application.
