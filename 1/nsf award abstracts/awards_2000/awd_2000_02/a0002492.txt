Funds are provided for a hydrographic
              survey, including lowered ADCP profiles, of the Irminger Sea.  Furthermore, two
              moored profilers will be deployed for periods of three years.  One profiler
              will be deployed in the center of the Irminger Gyre and the other at the edge
              of the Deep Western Boundary Current.  They will be serviced once a year. 
              These profilers will monitor the vertical structure of temperature, salinity,
              and current.  It is anticipated that these instruments will record signals
              indicative of deep convection.  An important water mass involved in the
              meridional overturning circulation of the North Atlantic is Labrador Sea Water.
               These waters have recently been observed forming in the Labrador Sea.  This
              program is designed to test the hypothesis that water of similar
              characteristics is actively formed in the Irminger Sea.
