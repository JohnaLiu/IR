Description:  This award supports US-India Cooperative
              Research: Fundamental Study of Ultrathin Gate Dielectrics for Nanoelectronics. 
              US PI Rajendra Singh, Clemson University and Indian collaborator, Samares Kar,
              Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur will conduct basic research on
              metal-oxide silicon field-effect transistors (MOSFETs).  Their study will focus
              on two-gate dielectric materials, one of the most important issues facing
              ultrathin gate dielectrics.  The results are expected to add to our
              understanding of the reliability of ultrathin gate dielectrics and to be useful
              in developing the technology for future generations of MOSFETs and integrated
              circuits.

Scope:  This research is highly relevant to the continued
              advancement of silicon Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits technology. 
              It should contribute advanced knowledge in the fabrication of ultrathin gate
              insulator films for nanoscale MOSFETs.  Additionally, it supports the aim of
              the US VLSI industry, which is to produce complex circuits with nanoscale
              device features by 2010.  The PIs are active contributors to journals,
              conferences and workshops, so the results of their work should receive broad
              attention.  This effort will enhance collaboration between US and Indian
              scientists and support a linkage with one of India's premier institutes of
              technology.
