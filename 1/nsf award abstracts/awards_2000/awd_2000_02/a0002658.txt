Dr. Otugen
              proposes to extend the technique of measuring velocity gradients that he
              developed earlier to develop a probe, which can measure one component of the
              vorticity directly.  The technique is laser based and non-intrusive.  It is
              proposed that by mixing scattered light from two closely spaced volumes, the
              desired velocity gradients can be determined to obtain the vorticity component.
               Once the probe is developed, it will be applied to study the effect of
              streamline curvature on an equilibrium turbulent boundary layer.
