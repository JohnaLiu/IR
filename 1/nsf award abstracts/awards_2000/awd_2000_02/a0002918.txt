The goal of the Pserc Center at the Colorado School
              of Mines will be to integrate advances from power systems, control theory,
              artificial intelligence, diagnostics, new sensor-technologies, etc. to assist
              the electric utility industry in facing these new challenges.

The research,
              which is complementary to those of the other Pserc sites, will focus on the
              following topics:

Development of Intelligent Substation; Advanced Power
              Generation Control with Integrated Economics, Variable Demands and Short-Term
              Load Forecast; Development of Advanced Sensors and Sensory Feedback Systems for
              Increased Reliability and Lower Maintenance Cost; Predictive Maintenance for
              Reduction of Operating Cost; Development of Remote Health Assessment Techniques
              T&D; and EMAT Based Diagnostics of Overhead Transmission Lines.
