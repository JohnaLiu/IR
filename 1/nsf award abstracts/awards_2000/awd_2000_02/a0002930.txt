Abstract    :
              0002930
It is now well recognized that shape-memory materials derive their
              unusual and inherently nonlinear and anisotropic properties from the fine-scale
              rearrangements of phases, or ``microstructures,'' and  that the  strain
              produced in the pseudoelasticity effect, as well as that recovered during the
              shape-memory effect, depends on  crystal orientations. Specially oriented
              single crystals of some shape memory materials can produce sizeable strains (~
              10%) due to phase transformations.  Practical shape-memory materials are
              typically polycrystalline in nature, and because of their thermo-mechanical
              processing history, they are initially textured. It has recently been
              recognized that the initial crystallographic texture of sheets, wires and rods
              of shape-memory alloys  is crucial in determining the overall properties  of
              these materials. The pronounced anisotropies caused by the initial texture need
              to be properly accounted for in developing a robust computational capability
              for the improved design of geometrically-complex engineering components made
              from shape memory materials. We shall  

   Experimentally study the effects
              of initial texture on the thermo-mechanical response of the  shape-memory alloy
              Ti-Ni, in both bulk form, and thin films. This material is finding increased
              use as a functional/smart-material for a variety of applications. Ti-Ni alloys
              in thin-film form are promising materials for microactuators, because of the
              enhanced rate of heat transfer in thin films.

  Develop constitutive
              equations and computational procedures for modeling and simulation of the
              important pseudoelasticity and shape-memory effects observed  in these
              materials.  

The mathematical models and procedures that we plan to develop
              should be useful
in the design of components for enhanced  thermo-mechanical 
              performance.
