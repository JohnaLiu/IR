Abstract    :
              This ocean science technology development project will develop a fiber-optic
              index of refraction sensor for ocean microstructure research.  The sensor
              offers improved resolution of the density gradient spectrum of oceanic
              turbulence over present sensors and will enhance studies involving our
              understanding and modeling of global oceanic circulation.  The project builds
              on previous work that modified an immunoassay fiber-optic technology to develop
              a laboratory prototype refractometer, which will be modified and tested as an
              ocean-deployable sensor.  This sensor has the potential to be thirty times more
              sensitive than previous sensors designed for oceanic microstructure research. 
              If successful, resulting measurements will contribute to a better understanding
              of ocean mixing.
