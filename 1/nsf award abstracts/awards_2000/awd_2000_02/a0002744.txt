Proposal Title: Cosmic Ray Modulation Studies Using
              Neutron Monitor and Spacecraft Detectors Near the Earth

Principal
              Investigator: John A. Lockwood, University of New Hampshire 

The
              investigators will study cosmic ray solar modulation near the Earth during the
              coming solar maximum and consequent reversal of the solar magnetic field. The
              main effort is to continue operation of the Mount Washington neutron monitor,
              and to employ the data obtained, together with data from other neutron monitors
              and spacecraft to compare the onset of the current modulation cycle with
              previous cosmic ray modulation cycles. Galactic cosmic ray fluxes vary, or are
              "modulated" in response to changes in the interplanetary magnetic environment,
              which in turn derives from the magnetic activity on the surface of the Sun.
              This magnetic activity is most manifest in the cycle of sunspots and solar
              flares lasting approximately eleven years. However the polarity of the magnetic
              field reverses every sunspot cycle, so the true magnetic cycle spans 22 years.
              Only two magnetic cycles have been observed with high accuracy particle
              detectors like the neutron monitor on Mount Washington, which has operated
              continuously from 1954 to the present. The investigators will also study solar
              cosmic ray events in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Bern,
              Switzerland.
