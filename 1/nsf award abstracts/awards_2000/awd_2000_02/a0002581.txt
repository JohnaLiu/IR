The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.

This award will provide Dr. Peter M.
              Abbamonte with support for twelve months work with Dr. George A. Sawatzky at
              the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.  His project is entitled "Novel
              Resonant Soft X-Ray Scattering from Correlated Electron Systems."  This project
              is co-funded by NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences'
              Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.


The PI and his host propose to use
              novel x-ray scattering techniques to study charge and spin ordering in
              correlated electron systems.  Initially they plan to measure the incommensurate
              phases and also the magnetic flux-line lattice in High Tc superconductors using
              resonant soft x-ray diffraction.  This will be done with a unique UHV
              diffractometer of their design.  This is a completely new spectroscopic
              technique that they believe will someday be standard in synchrotrons around the
              world.  Their hope is to begin a new sub-field of structure determination
              techniques.

Drs. Abbamonte and Swatzky will be working for part of the
              duration at the European Synchrotron Research Facility in Grenoble, France. 
              Dr. Sawatzky has expertise in core spectroscopy and many-body theory, UHV
              techniques and x-ray spectroscopy.
