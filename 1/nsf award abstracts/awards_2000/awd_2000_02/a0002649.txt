This is a one-year cooperative proposal between Dr. Yang WANG
              of Florida State University, and Drs. Junshe DONG and Tao DENG of the Institute
              of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Science. 
              This project is proposed by an U.S. woman scientist at an early stage in her
              career.  This project involves the study of isotopic evidence for late Cenozoic
              ecosystem and climate changes in Southwest China.  Dr. Wang is the first person
              to apply carbon and oxygen isotope analysis to paleo-material originating from
              China.  This study can provide important data to reduce considerable
              uncertainty about the evolution of ecosystems and environments in China in the
              past 10 million years.  The Chinese Academy of Science, the Natural Science
              Foundation of China and the NSF jointly support this project.
