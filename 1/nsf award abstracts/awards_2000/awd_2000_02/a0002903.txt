Abstract    :
              A process study called the Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate Processes in
              the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere System (EPIC) is proposed to study the behavior of
               the atmosphere and ocean in that region. The goals of the oceanographic
              component of EPIC are to describe, understand and quantify the evolution of the
              major oceanic structures and processes in the upper ocean under the deep
              convection region of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in order to
              improve regional models and ultimately gain better prediction of annual and
              interannual climate variability. Measurements will include mesoscale velocity
              temperature and salinity using expendable profilers dropped from aircraft,
              small scale velocity, temperature and salinity fields with a shipboard ADCP and
              continuous Seasoar sections, velocity microstructure and temperature, salinity
              and velocity finestructure by continuous microstructure profiling from a ship
              on station at 10 N, 95 W and radiometric and bio-optical profiles at various
              locations along 95 W.
