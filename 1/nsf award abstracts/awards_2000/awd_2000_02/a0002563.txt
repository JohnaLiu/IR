Abstract    :
              The proponents will make Thellier paleointensity determinations on multiple
              samples of glassy mid-ocean ridge basalt material from about ten dredges and
              about 40 wax cores from the East Pacific Rise at 15 to 16 degrees North. 
              Well-defined paleointensit values can be reliably obtained from glassy basalt
              samples and used to differentiate ages at least in the 0 to 2,000 year
              interval.  Selected samples will also be dated by radioisotopic methods.
