Abstract    :
              This project will provide measurements of aerosol number size distribution and
              hygroscopic properties of aerosols on board the NOAA Ron Brown research vessel
              during ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterization Experiment). The specific instruments
              to be deployed include Condensation Particle Counters, Differential Mobility
              Particle Sizers, Aerodynamic Particle Sizers, and Differential Mobility
              Analyzers, providing aerosol size distribution information over the entire
              relevant size range and hygroscopicity information as a function of particle
              size, including coarse particles. These measurements are crucial for
              characterizing the physical properties of the aerosol in the ACE-Asia region,
              and for closure studies of physical, chemical, and optical properties.
