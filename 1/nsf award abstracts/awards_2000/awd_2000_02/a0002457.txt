Abstract    :
              This award covers the Space and Atmospheric Sciences (SAS) portion of the
              research conducted at the Arecibo Observatory.  It includes the operation of
              the 450 MHz radar, lidar instrumentation, other passive optical instruments,
              and the ionospheric heating facility, planned for construction at the site. 
              Scientific studies conducted by the SAS staff cover the altitude range from the
              middle atmosphere through the topside ionosphere.  The staff will study
              ionospheric effects of meteor impacts, the chemistry and dynamics of the
              mesosphere, E-region instabilities, plasma composition and dynamics in the
              F-region, and minor ion species in the topside ionosphere.  The staff also
              provides support for other atmospheric scientists using the Arecibo observatory
              as part of experimental campaigns.  Scientists using the Arecibo
              instrumentation study a broad range of atmospheric phenomena relevant to
              studies of space weather and global change.  When completed the ionospheric
              heating facility will allow study of artificially modified plasma processes,
              wave excitation, and ion-neutral coupling.  With the 1000 foot antenna at the
              observatory, the 430 MHz radar is the most sensitive instrument of its kind in
              the world and it continues to provide unique observational data for a variety
              of scientific purposes.
