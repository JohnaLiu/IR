Abstract    :
              	An investigation of the Seismic Behavior of Retrofitted Steel Frame-Infill
              Masonry Walls Using Fiberglass Composite Laminates is underway at Drexel
              University; this investigation is funded by the National Science Foundation.
              This investigation includes experimental and analytical work. The funds
              requested are to purchase a 110-k actuator needed to perform the experimental
              work. The Structural-testing laboratory at Drexel University houses a newly
              built test bed and reaction wall, which was built from funds, provided by NSF
              in 1992. A two channel static and dynamic MTS loading system is available in
              the laboratory, which was partially funded by NSF in 1984. For efficient
              testing, an 110,000 lbs. Actuator is needed. It is to be noted that acquiring
              this medium load actuator will significantly improve our ability to perform
              static and dynamic testing.
