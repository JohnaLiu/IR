Abstract    :
                  This project involves the investigation of meteorological factors
              controlling the outflow of aerosols from Southeastern Asia.  The project has
              two components:  1) a historical analysis of meteorological data, visibility,
              and dust observations, and 2) operational support for the ACE-Asia intensive
              field campaign to be carried out during spring 2001.  For the historical
              analysis, the structure, intensity, area of occurrence and interannual
              variability of meteorological systems, both cyclones and anticyclones will be
              documented using retrospective analyses of dynamical variables (i.e.,
              meteorological fields obtained in a reanalysis) over a period of at least ten
              years. The research will include the surface and upper air fields, specifically
              including the larger-scale dynamical environment to which the surface systems
              relate and which control their development, motion and eventual decay. The
              spatial and temporal relationship of the occurrence of mineral dust to the
              parent meteorological system will be investigated.
