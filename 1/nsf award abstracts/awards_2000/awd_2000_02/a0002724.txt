Abstract    :
              	This award provides support for continued research into the dynamics of
              intraseasonal variability of the midlatitude atmosphere.  Dr. Robinson employs
              highly idealized models of the atmosphere, in this case a single level
              barotropic model on a sphere, which allow him to isolate and study fundamental
              processes of the atmosphere.  Under his previous award, Dr. Robinson and his
              student developed a new version of the barotropic model that incorporates
              information about the scale-dependent vertical structure of atmospheric eddies.
               The model now will be tested by doing hindcasts of episodes of low frequency
              variability.  The dynamics of the model will be examined using several
              different approaches.  The role of transient-eddy forcing for low frequency
              variability will be diagnosed by forcing the model with observed transient-eddy
              potential vorticity fluxes.  Dr. Robinson hopes to demonstrate that, with the
              vertical structure eddy information, the simple model will agree quantitatively
              with observations, thus providing confidence that the conceptual insights
              gained with the idealized model are relevant to the real atmosphere.
