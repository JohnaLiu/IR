Abstract    :
              EPIC (Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate processes in the coupled
              ocean-atmosphere system) is an activity of the US CLIVAR Program. EPIC 2001
              consists of four components focussing on (i) intertropical convergence
              zone/warm pool phenomena; (ii) cross-equatorial inflow into the intertropical
              convergence zone; (iii) upper ocean structure and mixing and (iv) an
              exploratory study of boundary layer cloud properties in the southeasterly
              tradewind regime. The field phase of EPIC 2001 is scheduled for a 6-week period
              during the interval Sept 1 to Oct 15, 2001. In addition to the eight awards
              made by ATM, this collaborative research has awards made by NSF/OCE and
              NOAA/OGP.

During the field phase, the PIs will collect data by small robotic
              aircraft called aerosondes. The aerosonde measurements will describe the
              evolution of the vertical structure of winds, temperature, relative humidity
              and pressure in the latitude-height cross sections from 5S to 5N. These data
              will make it possible to calculate and interpret budgets of mass, heat, water
              vapor and momentum in the cross equatorial flow, leading to better
              understanding of local air-sea interaction, boundary layer clouds, and
              large-scale dynamics in determining the evolution of cross equatorial
              atmospheric boundary layer structure. The work is important because it will
              improve understanding and modeling of climate variability over the eastern
              tropical Pacific.
