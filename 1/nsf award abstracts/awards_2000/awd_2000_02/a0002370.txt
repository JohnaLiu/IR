The response of the ocean circulation to stochastic wind
              forcing will 
be studied in a series of numerical experiments.  Wind fields
              from the 
operational meteorological models, together with data from some of
              the 
reanalysis efforts will be partitioned in frequency space.  The higher
              
frequency components will be regarded as stochastic.  An additional
              
estimate of the stochastic component of the wind field will be obtained 
by
              identifying the part that is uncorrelated with sea surface 
temperature. 
              Idealised, quasigeostrophic ocean models will be forced 
with idealized
              stochastic wind fields derived from the data products 
previously described. 
              The oceanic response will be compared with that 
predicted by the leading
              singular vectors of the oceanic flow.  More 
realistic ocean models will be
              forced with both idealized wind fields 
and the data from the operational and
              reanalyzed products.   The 
behavior of these more realistic runs will be
              compared with the 
stochastic optimals of the more realistic flow and with
              TOPEX/POSEIDON 
altimeter data.
