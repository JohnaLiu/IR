Description:  This award supports the US-India Workshop:
              Elastic Vibrations, Smart Structures and their Solution Technologies, Roorkee,
              November 2000.  Conveners, Atma Sahu, Coppin State College and H.G. Sharma,
              University of Roorkee will assemble 30 U.S. and Indian researchers for a
              cross-disciplinary workshop focused on vibrations and smart structures.  These
              areas are of high interest in the U.S. for industry and government applications
              and for the engineering of advanced technical systems.  There are important
              applications for general engineering reliability and durability problems, as
              well as for specific applications related to the modification of buildings for
              improved earthquake survivability and improved understanding of basic vibration
              mechanics. 

Scope:  The University of Roorkee is hosting this workshop with
              funds obtained from the Department of Science and Technology (DST).  The
              principals will layout a well-developed plan for future cooperative research in
              the areas of elastic vibrations and smart structures.  They will also establish
              partnerships for collaborations with India's oldest and most prestigious
              engineering college.  The workshop is expected to stimulate advanced research
              in areas that are of mutual interest and benefit.   The proceedings of the
              workshop will be published.
