Abstract    :
              	This project supports continued laboratory studies of photochemical reactions
              related to the cycling of HOx in the atmosphere. Laser-based diagnostics
              techniques, such as REMPI-TOF will be used to measure photolysis yields and
              reaction rates at temperature and pressure conditions relevant to the
              atmosphere. Specific tasks include: (1) photochemical studies to determine the
              quantum yield of O(1D) from the photolysis of ozone, (2) measurements of the
              rate coefficients for the reactions of oxygen atoms and hydroxyl radical (OH)
              with HO2 over the over the pressure range 50-750 Torr, (3) measurements of the
              rate coefficient for the recombination of OH with NO2 over the same pressure
              range, together with the rates of deactivation of vibrationally excited OH with
              NO2; and (4) measurements of the heat of formation of the isoprene-OH adduct
              and the rate coefficients for the reactions of the adduct with O2, NO, and NO2.
