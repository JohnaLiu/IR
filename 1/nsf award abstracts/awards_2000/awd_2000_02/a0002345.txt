Funds are provided for numerical and
              rotating tank experiments to investigate thermocline dynamics.  The basic
              set-up is a rotating tank with a differentially rotating upper lid and cooling
              at the lateral boundaries.  The upper lid is maintained hot and the lower lid
              is maintained cold.  (Flux conditions at the bottom and sidewalls can also be
              prescribed.)  The structure of the flow in laboratory simulations will be
              examined as a function of parameter space over ranges inaccessible to numerical
              simulation.  The stability of a rim current, observed in preliminary
              experiments, under continuously stratified conditions will be investigated. 
              Response to seasonal forcing, time scales long compared to the rotation time
              scale, will also be investigated.  It is anticipated that these experiments
              will illuminate the dynamics of upper ocean's response to combined wind and
              buoyancy forcing, a question which is central to physical oceanography.
