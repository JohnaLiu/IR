This award supports the gathering of American and Chinese
              researchers in technical innovation to explore common interests between the two
              research communities and to suggest an agenda for future research
              cooperation
Technical innovation is a key element influencing economic growth
              in 
post-industrial society.  China is currently undergoing one of the most
              rapid technological transformations in history, while the United States is a
              leader in the most advanced areas of technology.  Unlike most international
              conferences on technical innovation, this conference will focus on a few topics
              and on discussing them in depth.  These topics are 1) structural change in
              national innovation systems, 2) innovation networks, 3) international R&D
              investment, technology flows, and innovation, and 4) innovation and comercial
              performance within the firm. This conference is jointly supported by the
              National Science Foundation of the United States and the National Natural
              Science Foundation of China.
