Abstract    :
              This project will review the literature about the impacts of information
              technologies on scientific publishing. The project report will present an
              overview of (1) what existing data and research say about these effects and (2)
              what are the gaps in coverage.  Four major themes will be explored:  (1) the
              information technologies being applied in scientific publishing, (2) the
              effects of information technologies in scientific publishing on the ways that
              scholars seek, use, collaborate, and create new information, (3) the evolution
              of intellectual property and legal frameworks in response to the information
              technologies being applied in scientific publishing, and (4) the evolution of
              economic and organizational frameworks.  For each theme, the project will
              locate relevant studies, characterize them (e.g., descriptive, case study,
              theoretical/conceptual, statistical, historical), summarize their content, and
              identify gaps in coverage.  Statistical analyses will also be evaluated in
              terms of their sampling strategy, methodology, and whether there is evidence of
              standard error of estimate or discussion of the confidence margins.  The
              project approach will be to locate relevant studies, characterize them (e.g.,
              descriptive, case study, theoretical/conceptual, statistical, historical),
              summrize their content, and identify gaps in coverage.   Statistical analyses
              will also be evaluated in terms of their sampling strategy, methodology, and
              whether there is evidence of standard error of estimate or discussion of the
              confidence margins.
