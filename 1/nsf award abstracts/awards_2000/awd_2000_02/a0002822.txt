The Hispanic
              Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) is the recipient of an award
              for summer internship support.  HACU, a national, non-profit organization, has
              a long and distinguished record of providing summer internship opportunities
              through the organization's National Internship Program (NIP).  Through the NIP
              academically prepared students throughout the US and Puerto Rico have received
              quality internship assignments through various federal government agencies.
              Students who participate in the NIP are exposed to various career options in
              the Federal sector that serve as a basis in helping them make informed career
              choices and solidify career objectives.  By partnering with the Federal
              government, HACU has been able to successfully place over 2,200 students,
              representing 27 states and PR, in summer positions since NIP commenced in 1992.
               In an effort to continue its collaboration with HACU, the National Science
              Foundation, a participating government agency for the last few years, will
              offer challenging assignments that will broaden the exposure of participants
              pursuing careers in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET). 
              Internship opportunities create an unique opportunity to assist in the
              fulfillment of two core strategies related the goals of NSF's mission:
              developing intellectual capital, and integrating research and education.  As a
              result the Foundation actively participates in strengthening the infrastructure
              to achieve excellence in SMET education.
