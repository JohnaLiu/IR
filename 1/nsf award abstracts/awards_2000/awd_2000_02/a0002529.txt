This is an interdisciplinary study to investigate fundamental
              physical and biological processes in the Estuarine Turbidity Maximum (ETM) of
              Chesapeake Bay. ETM zones located in the upper reaches of estuaries, near the
              interface between salt and fresh water, are known to entrap fine sediments and
              to entrap or aggregate zooplankton and early-life stages of fish.  In
              Chesapeake Bay, a well-defined but poorly understood ETM occurs in the upper
              Bay. It is hypothesized that the ETM entraps sediment particles and planktonic
              organisms which in turn support enhanced zooplankton production and growth and
              survival of young anadrornous fish. This research will characterize
              constituents and evaluate processes operating in the Chesapeake ETM, including
              sediments and organisms that are of major ecological significance in the Bay. 
              A key species in the ETM is the copepod, Eurytemora affinis, which is a major
              food of larvae and juveniles of anadromous fishes (striped bass, white perch,
              shads, river herrings).
