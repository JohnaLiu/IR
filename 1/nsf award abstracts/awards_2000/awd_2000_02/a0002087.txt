Abstract    :
              This award is to support a Gordon Conference on Processing for Control of
              Microstucture Evolution and Performance: Modeling, Simulation and Verification,
              to be held July 23 - 28, 2000, in Plymouth, NH.  The topic is directed towards
              the fundamental understanding of the relationship between various processes,
              including casting solidification and the subsequent microstructures that evolve
              during and after the processing.  The focus is on predictive modeling for metal
              netshape processing.  Participation will be encouraged from among various
              disciplines, including metallurgists, materials scientists, alloy and process
              designers and mathematics modelers.  Graduate students, faculty and industrial
              researchers will be invited to attend.  This award, co-sponsored by the
              Division of  Design Manufacture and Industrial InnovationI and the Division of
              Materials Research, is for the support of participants to this conference.
