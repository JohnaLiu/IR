              will be provided to fifteen U.S. science and engineering graduate students to
              participate at an intensive course in Particle Technology especially offered by
              Prof. K. Leschonski at the University of Clausthal, Germany, July 1-9, 2000. 
              The course will be taught in English using the unique laboratory and pilot
              facilities for particle technology at the University of Clausthal.  It is aimed
              at providing students with exposure to both basic concepts in particle science
              and engineering and at instilling an appreciation of the particle technology
              field, its relevance to industry and international contributions.  Development
              of long-term contacts with researchers abroad is another objective.  Students
              will be selected by competition from the Departments of Chemical, Mechanical,
              Civil and Materials Science Engineering in U.S. universities and colleges and
              will require a statement from the student and a letter of recommendation from
              the student's advisor.  Three faculty advisors will help with the selection
              process and with the guidance of students during the instruction process. 
              DuPont will co-sponsor this activity.
