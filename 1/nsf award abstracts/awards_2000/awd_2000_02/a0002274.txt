Abstract    :
              The accurate estimation of the effects of fine particles on global radiative
              balance is dependent on an understanding of the chemical composition of fine
              particles as a function of size. The objective of this study is to determine
              the contribution of semi-volatile material and other species to the composition
              of fine particles from biogenic emissions, biomass burning, and anthropogenic
              sources in the Southern Africa region during the SAFARI 2000 program, and the
              elucidation of any changes in the composition of this fine particulate material
              as it is transported out over the Atlantic Ocean. Aerosol samples will be
              collected on the University of Washington Convair-580 aircraft during the
              SAFARI 2000 flights in collaboration with Dr. Hobbs (U. Washington) and Dr.
              Novakov (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). A diffusion denuder sampler
              suitable for airborne deployment will be used and the collected material
              analyzed for mass, sulfate, nitrate, and carbonaceous material.
