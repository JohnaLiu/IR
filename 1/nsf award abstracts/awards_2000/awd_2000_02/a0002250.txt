Abstract    :
              Funds are provided to support the study of the cause of a shift from laminated
              to bioturbated sediments inferred for several locations in the California
              Borderland and Gulf of California.  The hypothesis is that the shift from
              laminated to bioturbated conditions is due to changes in the oxygen utilization
              rate. Previous studies had focussed more at changes in oxygen concentration in
              the deep waters entering the basins and changes in the ventilation rate of the
              deep basins as the most probable explanation. A coring cruise is planned to
              collect multicores along transects in several basins along California/Baja
              margin. Study will be in collaboration with Mexican scientists.
