Abstract    :
              A field program is designed to determine the dynamics of the three-dimensional
              wind driven flow and its impact on the sea surface temperature in the eastern
              Pacific. The objective is to suggest a revised theory for the North Equatorial
              Counter Current (NECC) by testing several hypotheses involving a modification
              to linear Sverdrup theory and the role of the NECC in controlling the location
              and magnitude of the eastern Pacific warm pool. A two-ship survey will be
              conducted together with the deployment of surface drifters during the seasonal
              maximum of the NECC to measure the current, temperature and salinity structure
              of the upper ocean. The project is contribution to the Climate variability and
              Predictability Program (CLIVAR) and collaborative with Mexican scientists.
