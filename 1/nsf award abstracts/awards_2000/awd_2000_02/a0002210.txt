Abstract    :
              This project will provide radiation measurements on board the C-130 aircraft and
              at the ground site at Cheju Island, Korea, for ACE-Asia (Aerosol
              Characterization Experiment). Seven airborne spectral and broadband radiometers
              and five surface radiometers will be deployed. Flight tracks along extended
              aerosol gradients will be used to investigate the evolution of aerosol effects,
              in particular aerosol radiative forcing, as aerosol properties change as a
              function of time/distance over the ocean. The data will be integrated with
              other ACE-Asia measurements and radiative transfer modeling will be performed
              to estimate the radiative effects of aerosols be comparing observed and
              calculated radiative fluxes, optical depths, direct and diffuse radiation
              fields, and tropospheric/atmospheric heating.
