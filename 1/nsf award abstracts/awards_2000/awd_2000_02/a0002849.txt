An hyperbolic heat equation along
              with the equations expressing the
balance of mass, linear momentum and moment
              of momentum for
thermoviscoplastic materials will be used to delineate the
              initiation
and propagation of adiabatic shear bands (ASBs) during high strain
              rate
deformations of such materials.  An ASB is a narrow region of
              intense
plastic deformation that usually precedes the ductile failure of
              most
metals and some polymers deformed at high strain rates.  The
              heat
generated due to plastic deformations of the material, heat
              conduction
and thermal stresses induced will be accounted for.   The finite
              element
mesh will be refined adaptively and the time increment used to
              integrate
the coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations obtained by
              the
Galerkin approximation of the governing equations will be
              adjusted
adaptively so as to compute the stable solution within the
              prescribed
accuracy.  The energy dissipation rate within the shear banded
              material,
rate of energy conducted out of the edges of the band, and the
              energy
used to raise the temperature of the shear banded material will
              be
computed during the development of the shear band.  Its speed will
              be
ascertained by locating its edges at different times.

By modeling an ASB
              as a singular surface, we will determine its speed of
propagation and compare
              it with that computed above numerically.  It
should be noted that an ASB is
              not a wave in the classical sense and it
propagates edgewise rather than
              normal to its surface.  This speed will
be related to the state of deformation
              of the material within and
adjacent to the edge of the ASB.
