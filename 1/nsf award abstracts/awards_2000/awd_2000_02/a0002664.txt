Abstract    :
              
This collaborative project between the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
              and the University of New Hampshire addresses an ocean science and fisheries
              management requirement for improved capabilities for measuring the abundance
              and distribution of fish and other organisms in the open ocean.  Newly
              available multibeam echo sounders provide the capability to record and analyze
              acoustic returns on individual beams, which represents a new capability for the
              ocean research community.  A multibeam echo sounder will be tested and
              calibrated in three venues: fresh-water test tank, sea-well test facility, and
              in situ on a towed vehicle. The objectives of this calibration exercise are the
              determination of the on-axis response, sensitivity limits, hence dynamic range,
              and directivity patterns for each beam. The use of acoustic measurements for
              fish stock abundance and other research applications has been established, but
              the potential for measuring the numerical density of fish is difficult without
              a means of calibrating the system in situ. Results from this sonar calibration
              project will provide a means for attaining better areal coverage without
              compromising spatial resolution.
