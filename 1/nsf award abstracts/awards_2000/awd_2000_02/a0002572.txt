Abstract    :
              Technological Disaster, Resource Loss and Long-Term Social Change in a Subarctic
              Community 


In contrast to natural disasters, technological disasters have
              been found to have long-term community impacts.  The present research will
              identify patterns of social change in a small fishing community twelve years
              following the Exxon Valdez oil spill.  The loss of ecological, social and
              cultural resources will be related to patterns of community stress and change
              from survey and ethnographic data collected from 1989 through 2001.  This
              research will provide an evaluation of the Conservation of Resources
              theoretical model of collective stress for understanding the chronic social
              impacts of technological disasters for renewable resource communities.
