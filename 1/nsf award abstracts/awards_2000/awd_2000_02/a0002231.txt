This award will continue the leadership of the Center for
              Science, Mathematics and Engineering Education in the synthesis and application
              of research to educational improvement by outlining a series of strategic
              planning exercises.

Beginning with the establishment of a strategic planning
              advisory group, the Center will conduct a series of activities that include: 
              dialog with various experts; "roadmapping" exercises designed to bring greater
              coherence to the National Academy's work in education; and development of a
              coherent vision and revised mission statement for guiding future work.  These
              activities will conclude in a "white paper" that will convey the overall vision
              of the Center.

The recent decision to integrate the Board on Testing and
              Assessment (BOTA), the Board on International Comparative Studies in Education
              (BICSE), and the Center creates a unique opportunity for leadership.  Financial
              support is necessary to enable the Center to articulate a research and action
              plan and to build the appropriate infrastructure to carry out this strategic
              plan.
