Abstract    :
              Orcutt 00-02595

Recommended project is for testing of a broadband, high
              dynamic range seismic data system in a land-based borehole at Pinon Flat
              Observatory in California. This work is needed to optimize borehole seismometer
              installation at about 20 proposed permanent sites in the deep oceans that are
              needed to fulfill objectives of global seismic coverage as defined by the IRIS
              Global Seismic Network (GSN), in conjunction with the international Federation
              of Digital Seismic Networks. This proposal covers a series of experiments to
              reduce installation noise that was experienced in an earlier seismometer
              borehole installation at the OSN-1 site near Hawaii.
