Abstract    :
              The investigators will conduct analytical and high-resolution computational
              studies of thin current sheets which are formed during the growth phase of
              magnetospheric substorms.  These current sheets are observed in the magnetotail
              and may play an important role in substorm onset.  Previous calculations are in
              good quantitative accord with multi-satellite observations of the spatial and
              temporal characteristics of thin current sheets in the slow growth and
              impulsive pre-onset phases of substorms, and have led to the identification of
              the pressure-driven ballooning instability as a potential mechanism for
              substorm trigger.  This investigation will use the theoretical framework of
              Hall magnetohydrodynamics, including a generalized Ohm's law with Hall current
              and electron pressure gradient terms.  Tasks include the development of a more
              complete theory of reconnection, thin current sheet and magnetotail substorm
              dynamics, and dynamical coupling between pressure-driven ballooning
              instabilities with and without velocity shears.
