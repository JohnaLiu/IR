The 12th International Congress on Catalysis will be held in
              Granada, Spain during the week of July 9th.  The Council of the International
              Congress on Catalysis oversees these meetings and has representation from
              approximately 20 countries.  These meetings are held every four years, and the
              attendance has shown large increases due to a renewed world interest in the
              synthesis of specialty chemicals, petroleum-based products, and catalytic
              applications for the environment.  Attendance at the previous meeting exceeded
              1250.  Because advances in a large number of catalytic processes, which are
              crucial to US interests, will be presented at this meeting, it is important to
              ensure participation from both the academic and industrial sectors.  The
              Congress will focus on the topic of "New Frontiers in Catalysis."  Priority
              will be given to the following topics: molecular design of solid catalysts;
              recent developments in catalytic reactions; new experimental methods, and new
              industrial applications.  The proceedings of all International Congresses are
              published and constitute a significant contribution to the literature on
              catalysis.  This Congress will promote interchange among the international
              participants.  The purpose of this grant is to help defray costs for those
              participating in the meeting and for younger faculty.
