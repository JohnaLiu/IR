The purpose of this project is to prepare
              a five-year plan that will improve the quality of learning experiences,
              increase research activities, and attract more students to the computer science
              program. In this five-year plan, activities will be developed to promote active
              student learning through inquiry and project-based laboratory and classroom
              experiences.  The strategy used in developing the activities will be to
              identify and develop focus areas in computer science that will impact course
              and curriculum, research activities, laboratory improvement, faculty
              enhancement, and industry partnership.  The two main focus areas to be
              developed are (1) computing on a network and (2) data acquisition.
