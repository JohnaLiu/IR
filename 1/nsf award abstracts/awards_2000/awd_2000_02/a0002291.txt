This project develops and
              tests a political resource theory of how city policies and practices affect
              crime rates.  Political resource theories focus on how welfare policies result
              from various actors pursuing their interests, based on the resources available
              to them.  By identifying actors and resources in cities, this study develops a
              theory of how city politics affects criminal opportunity and social
              disorganization, primarily through welfare programs and policing.  The theory
              is applied to cities over 25,000 for the years 1981-96.  It uses pooled
              cross-sectional time-series analyses to test hypotheses regarding both crime
              and poverty control efforts, as well as their effects on social
              disorganization, criminal opportunity and crime rates.
