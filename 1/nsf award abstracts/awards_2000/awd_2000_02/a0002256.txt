Abstract    :
              EPIC (Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate processes in the coupled
              ocean-atmosphere system) is an activity of the US Climate Variability and
              Predictability (CLIVAR) Program. EPIC 2001 consists of four components
              focussing on (i) intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) warm pool phenomena;
              (ii) cross-equatorial inflow into the ITCZ; (iii) upper ocean structure and
              mixing; and (iv) an exploratory study of boundary layer cloud properties in the
              southeasterly tradewind regime. The field phase of EPIC 2001 is scheduled for a
              6-week period during the interval Sept 1 to Oct 15, 2001. In addition to the
              eight awards made by the Division of Atmospheric Sciences, this collaborative
              research has awards by NSF's Division of Ocean Sciences and NOAA's Office of
              Global Programs.

During the field phase, the PIs will collect data aboard
              R/V Ron Brown, both ship-based soundings and C-Band Doppler radar. These will
              be used to examine the vertical and horizontal structure of rainfall and ITCZ
              convection and its variability as a function of synoptic conditions. The
              requisite data will be collected to examine the diurnal cycle of convection and
              precipitation. The PIs will also examine the relationship between the boundary
              layer recharging through latent and sensible heat fluxes as a function of
              convective organization. The work is important because it will provide new
              insights about convection in the undersampled eastern tropical Pacific.
