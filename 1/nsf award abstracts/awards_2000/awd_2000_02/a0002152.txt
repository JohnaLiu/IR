Abstract    :
              The School District of Superior, Wisconsin will identify and appoint school and
              community mathematics and science professionals to an Advisory Planing Council
              to plan Superior Scientists, a comprehensive program targeted at girls in upper
              elementary, middle and high school, their parents, teachers, and guidance
              counselors.  Over the course of a year the council will plan activities to
              increase the number of girls enrolling in high school math, science, and
              technology courses, and therefore, increase the number of women eligible to
              work in science.

Components identified as critical to the success of the
              project include (1) working with girls at elementary, middle, and high school;
              (2) developing community resources for internships; (3) developing a
              professional women's network for mentoring; (4) improving curriculum to raise
              the mathematics and science achievement of all students; and (5) introducing
              teaching methods that incorporate experiences that interest girls.

An
              effective Advisory Planning Board and an application to the National Science
              Foundation's Program for Gender Equity for a Large Collaborative Project are
              primary outcomes set for this planning grant.
