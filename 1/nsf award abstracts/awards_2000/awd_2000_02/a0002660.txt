Description: This award supports a planning visit by
              Professor Shyamala Ratnayeke, Department of Biology, Spelman College in
              Atlanta, Georgia.  She plans to visit Sri Lanka in the summer of 2000 to do
              preliminary field work and to develop plans for future field research with Dr.
              Charles Santiapillai, Zoology Department at the University of Peradeniya in
              Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, and with officials of the government of that country. 
              The topic is the inter and intra-specific diversity in animals, with
              applications for the allocation and management of protected habitats for
              carnivores, especially for sloth bears.  Spelman College is a primarily
              undergraduate institute, and this award will provide the PI with a unique
              opportunity to develop a viable collaborative research proposal in an area of
              interest to the programs of NSF Division of Environmental Biology.  The
              proposal meets INT objectives for supporting planning visits when they are
              essential for developing international collaboration.
