Abstract    :
              This study tests the hypothesis that along a rocky coastline nearshore
              topographically generated secondary circulation affects the cross-shelf
              dispersal of the larvae of coastal organisms.  Secondary circulation may
              isolate the waters within a small bay from the more offshore waters and my
              prevent larvae from dispersing out into the coastal waters.  Alternatively, it
              could prevent larvae that have developed in the coastal waters from returning
              to settlement sites on the shore. These possibilities will be investigated, as
              well as the underlying patterns and mechanisms.  This study would be the first
              test of these hypotheses.

Physical oceanography and concurrent larval
              distributions associated with topographically generated secondary circulation
              will be described at sites along the Oregon coast.  CTD transects will be taken
              extending from the beach through the secondary circulation front and out into
              the coastal waters.  Transects of vertical plankton tows will be made
              concurrently with the CTD sampling to describe the distribution of
              meroplankton.  By affecting larval dispersal, this small-scale circulation
              could bring about variations in the settlement and recruitment of larvae to the
              shore.  At Sunset Bay, abundance and settlement of cyprids and mussels will be
              measured at mooring sites across the front at the mouth of the bay.  Following
              the accumulation of animals on settlement plates and brushes will monitor
              settlement.
