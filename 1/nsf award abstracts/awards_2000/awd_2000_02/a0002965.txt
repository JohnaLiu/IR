Abstract    :
              SES 00 -0002965 - Lee Chambers-Schiller (University of Colorado)
Nuclear
              Workers, Nuclear Town: Los Alamos, New Mexico, 1947-74

The award supports a
              series of approximately 100 oral histories to be taken over a year's time. The
              subjects include Los Alamos weapons scientists of the second generation (that
              is, those who came to the laboratory during the post-war build-up of 1947-54),
              their spouses, laboratory administrators and non-scientific workers, community
              leaders, and those who provided professional services or goods to the
              community. Many of these latter were Hispanics or Native Americans who lived in
              surrounding communities and commuted to work in Los Alamos.
The interviews
              will be recorded on audiotape by the primary investigator using a largely
              open-ended format. The basic question underlying the interviews will be: "How
              did the laboratory and its mission shape your work, community and family
              life?"

The purpose of these interviews is to provide primary source material
              for a book on the history of the laboratory and the community of Los Alamos
              during the early years of the Cold War. An in-depth community study, the
              project is nevertheless intended to address questions that go beyond the
              particularity of the Los Alamos experience in order to contribute to historical
              understanding of the arms race and the impact of weapons science,
              militarization and security culture on Cold War America.
