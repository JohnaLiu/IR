Abstract    :
              This project supports the deployment of instrumentation to study aerosol
              chemistry on the C-130 aircraft during ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterization
              Experiment). A total aerosol sampler (TAS) will be used to collect aerosols
              without inlet losses and analyze them for major ions. A micro-orifice impactor
              will be used to collect size-segregated samples for ion analysis. Samples will
              be collected on a single stage impactor for analysis of EC/OC
              (organic/elemental carbon). Procedures for the analysis of these samples using
              a new EC/OC analyzer will be developed in time for the field deployment. An
              aerodynamical particle analyzer (APS) will be used to determine particle size
              distributions in the 0.5 - 10 micron range. In addition, PI Barry Huebert will
              serve as Lead Scientist for the ACE-Asia experiment.
