              Abstract for Liebermann 

A CAREER development plan for the integration of
              research and education in the area of upper atmospheric remote sensing at Duke
              University is proposed.  The research component focuses on the development and
              implementation of a new broadband radio technique designed to detect radio
              signals from lightning bolts.  The analysis of these observations would examine
              the frequency dispersion of these signals to study the horizontal and vertical
              distribution of ionospheric plasma by a tomographic inversion using a three
              dimensional model of the propagation of broadband signals through the
              ionospheric waveguide.  The educational component is aimed at curriculum
              development, graduate and undergraduate student training and mentoring, and
              incorporating elements of the proposed research into classroom and laboratory
              teaching.
