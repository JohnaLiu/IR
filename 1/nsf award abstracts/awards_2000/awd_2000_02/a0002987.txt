Abstract    :
              The Particulate Materials Center (PMC), a National Science Foundation I/UCRC ,
              is a focal point for interdisciplinary research, education, and technology
              transfer of particulate materials processing.  Particulate materials processing
              and manufacture is of vital importance to the advanced materials, ceramics,
              chemical, cosmetic, electronics, image processing, mineral processing, and
              pharmaceutical industries.  Continual technological developments and improved
              scientific understanding are required to enhance product quality, to reduce
              process costs and time, and to minimize pollution during manufacture.  Powder
              formation, powder handling and fabrication, particle dispersion, and sintering
              of shaped products from powders are disciplines of central interest to PMC
              members.
