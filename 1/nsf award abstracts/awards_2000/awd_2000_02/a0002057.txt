Abstract    :
              SES 00-02057 - Nadine Weidman (Independent Scholar) -  "The Aggression Debate:
              Human Nature, Science Popularization, and Politics in Late Twentieth-Century
              America"

The project is a historical study of the debate over the origins
              and nature of human aggression that took place in the 1960s and 1970s between
              the Austrian ethologist Konrad Lorenz (1903-1989) and the British-born American
              anthropologist M. F. Ashley Montagu (1905-1999). In a series of widely popular
              books, Lorenz and his followers argued that aggressiveness in humans was an
              instinct, an innate and unavoidable tendency, while Montagu maintained in
              writings also aimed at a lay audience that aggression resulted primarily from
              environmental stimuli. By examining popular writings, television, radio, and
              film productions, scientific papers, and the archival record, and by conducting
              interviews with several of the participants, the principal investigator plans
              to show how the Lorenz-Montagu aggression debate and the public responses to it
              affected conceptions of human nature, techniques and goals of scientific
              popularization, and political liberalism in late twentieth-century America. The
              analysis will consist of four parts: (1) of the Lorenz--Montagu debate; (2) of
              its relation to its scientific and intellectual contexts; (3) of the audience
              response to the debate; (4) of the relation of the debate to the biological
              determinisms of succeeding decades.
