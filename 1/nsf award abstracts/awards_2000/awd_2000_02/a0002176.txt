Abstract    :
                 ACE-Asia is a multi-institution, international program to study the chemistry
              and optical properties of aerosols in outflow from eastern Asia.  This project
              involves the installation of a 20 meter tall air sampling tower with outrigger
              platform at Kosan, Cheju Island, South Korea.  This tower will support the
              sampling and analysis activities of numerous ACE-Asia ground
              investigators.
