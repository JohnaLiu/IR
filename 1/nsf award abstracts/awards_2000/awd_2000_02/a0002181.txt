Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project concerns, at the most general level, changing
              conceptions of the place of humans in nature, from the point of view of the
              natural and human sciences. More specifically, the research concerns the fate
              of the "overkill" model of Pleistocene extinctions. During the first half of
              the twentieth century, climatic models dominated explanations for the
              disappearance of more than 35 genera of American large mammals following the
              last ice age. Beginning in the 1960s, these models were challenged by the
              proposal that paleolithic human hunters, entering a continent filled with
              unsuspecting prey, decimated the local megafauna. The "overkill" hypothesis
              challenged natural and social scientists to collaborate across the traditional
              divide separating "human" sciences like archaeology and anthropology, and
              "natural" sciences like paleoecology, climatology, geology, and paleontology.
              In connection with the boundary issues and interdisciplinary efforts involved
              in debates over the place of humans in nature, the dissertation research also
              addresses the putative environmental implications of early human-caused
              extinction, and also issues concerning Native American legacies and identities.
