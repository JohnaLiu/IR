Description:  This award supports US-India Cooperative
              Research: Thermo-tectonic Evolution of the Himalayan Metamorphic Rocks, Sikkim.
               US PI Jibamitra Ganguly, University of Arizona and Somnath Dasgupta, Jadavpur
              University, Calcutta will study the presence of an inverted metamorphic
              Barrovian sequence along the 2000-km length of the Himalayas.  Studies which
              consider the Himalayan metamorphism within the framework of the Indian-Eurasian
              plate collision have not satisfactorily explained the inversion of the
              Barrovian isograds.  The PIs will use an integrated approach in this study that
              includes field relations, petrographic studies, laboratory studies and
              numerical modeling.   

Scope:  The international collaboration is highly
              advantageous to this study.  Professor Dasgupta is a distinguished scholar and
              a preeminent field geologist in India. His recent work that was published in
              the Journal of Petrology (1998) is a major contribution to understanding
              tectono-metamorphic processes in the Himalayas.  NSF's Division of
              International Programs and the Government of India's Department of Science and
              Technology and Geological Survey jointly support this research.
