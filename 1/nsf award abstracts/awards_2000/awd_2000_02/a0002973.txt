The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory is developing
              "SportSmarts," a national education campaign that builds on people's
              fascination with sports.  SportSmarts plans to reach children and adults who
              are unlikely to turn their attention to science by "going to the sport" to
              reach audiences in places where sports are played or watched.  During this
              planning phase, the project will:

    create proof of concept programming;

                 research appropriate sports science content;
    build networks,
              partnerships and coalitions;
    create plans for outreach, evaluation, public
              relations and financing; and
    establish strong potential distribution
              outlets.
