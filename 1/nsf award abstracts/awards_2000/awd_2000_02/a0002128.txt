In this project, the PIs will analyze data from Acoustic
              Doppler 
Profilers (ADCP) used during the Indian Ocean Survey carried out as
              part 
of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  Shipboard ADCPs
              
provided high resolution sections of velocity in the upper 300 meters 
along
              the survey lines.  Lowered ADCPs (LADCP) provided full depth 
profiles at
              every hydrographic station along the tracks.  The central 
objective is to
              describe the ocean current field in the Indian Ocean, 
with emphasis on the
              deep lowered ADCP data set.  The study will also 
include use of other
              parameters measured such as temperature, salinity, 
chemical tracers, float
              and drifter tracks, satellite altimetric sea 
level measurements, etc. 
              Observed currents will be compared with 
numerical general circulation model
              output to evaluate the models' 
ability to mimic the phenomena and dynamics of
              the ocean.
