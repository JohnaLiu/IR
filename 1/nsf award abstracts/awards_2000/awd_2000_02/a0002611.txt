This is a conference on Understanding Phage
              Display: Structure, Biology and Applications.  Phage display is a rapidly
              growing and expanding area of biotechnology used to identify peptide ligands. 
              Although there are 4-6 meetings on phage dABisplay per year, none of them
              address the fundamental biological or structural basis of the technology. 
              However as this technology matures, it is becoming clear that the biology of
              the phage-host cell system places intrinsic limitations on the technology. 
              Reducing these limitations will be critical for future advancement s in the
              field.  To catalyze research efforts in this area, and to make the community
              more aware of the biological limits of the technology, this conference will
              explore the biological basis of phage display technology, and will address
              strategies for expanding the utility of the system through manipulation of the
              biological system.  Each session will contain talks on the basis sciences of an
              aspect of phage biology pertinent to phage display as well as talks on its
              applications in structural biology, biochemistry, or other areas.  The plan is
              to lead the speakers and participants into discussions of biological and
              structural constraints of phage display and ideas on how to overcome or
              circumvent them.
