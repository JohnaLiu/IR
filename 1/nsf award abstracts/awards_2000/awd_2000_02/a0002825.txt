Abstract    :
              On March 16-19, 2000 the Fourteenth Annual National Conference of Black Physics
              Students (NCBPS) will be held in Greensboro, North Carolina hosted by North
              Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (AT&T).  The objective of
              the NCBPS meeting is to assist an encourage African-American students who have
              shown interest and ability in physics and astronomy to enter and complete Ph.D.
              programs, and to initiate research, teaching, or technical careers commensurate
              with their educational achievement in physics and astronomy.  This meeting will
              enable the undergraduate and graduate attendees of the NCBPS (attendance goal,
              approximately 165-190 students) to interact with each other as well as with
              successful minority and non-minority scientists in both a formal and informal
              environment.  The National Society of Black Physics will also be meeting at A&T
              during the time that the NCBPS will be held and will have overlapping
              activities for one day of the conference, thereby providing another avenue for
              these students to interact with Black physicists.  Additionally, A&T will bring
              in approximately 100+ minority public school students and their teachers for
              one day of the conference.  The NCBPS tradition on increased importance as we
              move toward the new millennium with hopes of meeting the growing challenges of
              an increasingly technology-driven world.
