Kadko
This award allows David Kadko of the University of Miami to
              visit Iceland to make preliminary investigations into the crustal residence
              times of fluids circulating through the geothermal systems there.  The
              objectives of the investigations are to understand the hydrogeologic sampling
              sites and facilities available, obtain documents and maps available only in
              Iceland, and work out the unique contributions to be provided by each side. 
              The overall results of the research will make it possible to study the ocean
              ridge system in entirely new ways, test sampling and analysis methods, and
              provide for an exchange of information and analytical techniques between
              experts in Iceland and the U.S.
