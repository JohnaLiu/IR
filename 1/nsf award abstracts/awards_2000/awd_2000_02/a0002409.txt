This project studies
              forces leading to some of the key reforms of the Second Vatican Council
              (1962-65).  Four proposals, two liberal reforms, one conservative reform, and
              one compromise reform, brought before the Council are treated as outcomes of
              political forces, compromises, and log-rolling.  The project proposes a
              competition model based on differential resources, political opportunities, and
              cultural differences.  The analyses use archival materials from Italy,
              Washington DC, and Berkeley CA.  Cultural forces appear in content analyses of
              various drafts of proposals, speeches, diaries, public statements during
              deliberation, and vote outcomes.  The research will assess several hypotheses
              on how cultural institutions respond to changes in their social environment.
