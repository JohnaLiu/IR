As a result of two international research conferences
              held in late 1999 in Honolulu, it became the general consensus that "the
              ability to forecast coastal environmental change forced both by human
              influences and ambient processes needs immediate focus and improvement."  It
              was also agreed that a workshop on Coastal Forecasting should be convened. 
              This proposal is a follow-up on that recommendation.  PIs are requesting funds
              to hold this workshop at Rice University during the late summer or early fall
              of 2000 to identify critical research needed for forecasting coastal response
              to climate change.
