Abstract    :
              The extensive body of information collected during and after the May 3, 1999
              outbreak of intense tornadoes affords an opportunity to study, for the first
              time in a single venue, all components of this significant natural disaster. 
              The goals of the Symposium are to document the current state of knowledge in
              dealing with severe local storms, identify the successes and failures on May 3
              in specific areas, specify  challenges for the future, and determine how best
              to proceed as a unified community. The symposium is viewed as a mechanism for
              joining many traditionally separate communities and disciplines to provide a
              framework for their future interaction.
