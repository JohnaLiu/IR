Abstract    :
              This project will result in the creation and distribution of a linguistically
              annotated version of an existing corpus of Japanese telephone conversations,
              the CallHome Japan (CHJ) corpus.

The CHJ corpus, released in 1996 by the
              Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), consists of digitized speech data and text
              transcriptions of 120 spontaneous, unscripted telephone conversations in
              Japanese. While the transcriptions are of high quality, the usefulness of the
              CHJ corpus for language research is limited by its lack of any syntactic,
              semantic, prosodic, or discourse annotations, including part-of-speech (POS)
              tags.

This project will address this deficiency by creating a new version of
              the CHJ corpus that includes useful POS, semantic and acoustic annotations. In
              particular, the following annotations will be provided for the entire
              corpus:

1. POS tags, using the LDC's inventory of 60 POS and morphological
              tags for Japanese;
2. Lexical semantic tags on verbs and nouns, using NTT's
              400,000-word Goi-Taikei semantic lexicon and ontology.

The annotated corpus
              will be made available to the general research community through the normal
              channels of the Linguistic Data Consortium. This annotated corpus will
              stimulate and benefit research in corpus linguistics, natural language
              processing, Japanese linguistics, discourse and conversation analysis,
              variation (crosslinguistic, cross-cultural, and gender), and the
              prosody/syntax/semantics interfaces.
