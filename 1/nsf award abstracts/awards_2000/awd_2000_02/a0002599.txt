Abstract    :
              This project represents a collaboration between Barry Huebert, University of
              Hawaii (ATM-0002604), Richard Arimoto, New Mexico State University
              (ATM-0002599), and Irina Sokolik, University of Colorado (ATM-0002746) and is
              part of the ACE-Asia Project (Aerosol Characterization Experiment). Coordinated
              measurements of aerosol chemical properties will be carried out by Dr. Huebert
              and Dr. Arimoto. Other collaborators, supported separately, will provide
              measurements of aerosol optical properties and radiation (Michael Bergin,
              Georgia Tech) and single-particle analysis (James Anderson, Arizona State
              University). The measurements will be carried out at Zhenbeitai, a site near
              Yulin, Shaanxi Province, China. This site was chosen to represent the dust
              source regions of China. Detailed in-situ characterization of the aerosols
              found there will provide important information for the interpretation of
              measurements of aerosol properties in the airborne intensive of ACE-Asia
              downwind of the Asian continent. Dr. Sokolik will provide numerical analyses
              aimed at quantifying the radiative forcing by Asian multicomponent aerosols and
              their impacts on climate.
