This project
              studies aircraft accident reports, including both commercial and general
              aviation.  It uses participant observation, content analyses of reports, and
              interviews with investigators.  The overall aim is to assess the effects of
              institutional culture in shaping the choice of accidents to investigate,
              factors investigated and, possibly, causes of the accidents that are
              identified.  The study follows in the sociological tradition of institutional
              factors in "normal accidents," the kinds and rates that come to be expected in
              various industries.  Several hypotheses relating institutional culture and
              structure to the investigations will be assessed.
