This action involves an Interagency transfer from NSF to the
              USGS of funds to cover expenses associated with an Environmental Assessment
              (EA), drilling permits and lease costs for the San Andreas Fault Observatory at
              Depth (SAFOD).  SAFOD is part of the Earthscope Phase 1 Initiative that is
              included in the MRE Request in NSF's FY 2001 Budget now before Congress
 
              
SAFOD involves drilling a 4 km deep hole penetrating the San Andreas Fault. 
              Such an undertaking involves considerable advance planning, obtaining permits,
              leasing land, etc.  The project involves about 100 scientists from the U.S and
              abroad and will be conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey
              (USGS), the Department of Energy (DoE) and foreign institutions.  The specific
              items for which funding is being requested from NSF are:

1) $10,000 to
              extend the lease option on the SAFOD site for another year.  The USGS paid the
              lease option last year, so it is appropriate that NSF pay the lease option in
              FY 2001.

2) $20,000 for the NSF share of the EA and associated drilling
              permits.  This represents half the total; the USGS will pay the other
              half.
