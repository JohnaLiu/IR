The broad
              region of Beringia is separated by the Bering Strait.  North Pacific waters
              rich in nutrients flow northward along the eastern Bering Sea continental
              slope, across the shelf and into the Chukchi Sea, sustaining high surface
              water.  The Pacific waters also contribute about 30 percent of the Arctic
              Ocean's fresh water budget (about half of the river's contribution) which helps
              maintain the Arctic halocline, Arctic sea ice, and regulates climate in the
              North Atlantic region.  During the last glacial maximum (LGM), sea level was
              lowered by 125 meters, Beringia was much larger and the Pacific and Arctic
              Oceans were separated by nearly 1000 kilometers.  Beringian climate was more
              uniform because the sea was so distant.

The exact role of the ocean in
              controlling Beringian climate is unknown because of the lack of data on the
              surrounding seas.  The history of relative sea level is poorly known, but is
              likely to have differed from eustatic sea level because of tectonic and
              possible glacio-eustatic effects.  Sea surface conditions such as ice extent,
              temperature, and salinity are likely to influence the climate through albedo
              effects, heat exchange, and humidity, but there are almost no high-resolution
              proxy data for these properties in the Bering and Chukchi Seas.  To link the
              marine and terrestrial realms in Beringia, the Principal Investigators will
              participate in a field program of gravity, piston and vibracoring in the Bering
              and Chukchi Seas to develop high resolution records of 1) intermediate ocean
              ventilation in the Bering Sea; 2) surface ocean temperature, salinity, sea ice
              extent, and history of iceberg discharge in both the Bering and Chukchi Seas;
              and 3) relative sea level in the Bering Strait region since the LGM.  These
              objectives are closely aligned with the theme of the October 1999 NSF-sponsored
              workshop on "Assessing Impacts of Arctic Bathymetry Changes and Fresh Water
              Inputs on Shelf and Ocean Circulation for the Past 20,000 Years."
