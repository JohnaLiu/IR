Abstract    :
              This award is to support a workshop to be held in conjunction with the American
              Society of Mechanical Engineers Annual Congress and Exhibition, to be held in
              Orlando, Florida, November 7-8, 2000.  The objective of the workshop is to
              invite participants from industry and academia to discuss opportunities for
              research collaboration in manufacturing of micro-electro-mechanical systems
              (MEMS).
         
While tremendous progress has been made in several critical
              areas, there are four areas that are critical to the manufacturing of MEMS
              where the fundamental understanding remains at issue.  These are the
              fundamental phenomena of MEMS, MEMS applications in sensing systems, MEMS
              applications in actuators, and MEMS reliability and packaging.
