Abstract    :
              Measurements of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) will be
              performed on board the C-130 aircraft during ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterization
              Experiment). A recently developed instrument will be deployed that is capable
              of measuring SO2 at a frequency of 1 Hz and a detection limit of 1 ppt. The
              instrument is based on atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometery
              (APIMS). Isotopically labelled SO2 will be used as an external standard. The
              fast response time will make it possible to rapidly identify different
              atmospheric layers. Of particular interest in the ACE-Asia program will be
              urban pollution layers (high in SO2) and dust layers, and the question of the
              degree to which dust and SO2 interact chemically.
