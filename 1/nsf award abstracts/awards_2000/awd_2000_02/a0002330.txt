Abstract    :
              This project supports the analysis and interpretation of single particle samples
              collected during ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterization Experiment). Samples will
              be collected by James Anderson and collaborators (supported via ATM-002513).
              This project will focus on samples collected onboard the NOAA R/V Ron Brown.
              Analysis will be performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Data
              interpretation will focus on questions of mineral aerosol composition, origin,
              transport, and chemical transformation processes.
