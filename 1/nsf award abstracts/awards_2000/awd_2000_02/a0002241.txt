This study examines
              relationships between property rights systems and enterprise productivity in
              rural China.  It compares stock-sharing cooperatives to village-owned
              collective systems.  Productivity in the two different kinds of enterprises
              will be assessed through a variety of methods, primarily through structured
              observation of the collectives and interviews with participants.  Results will
              document some social and economic consequences of Chinese experiments with
              different social forms.  They will show how aspects of the experiments affect
              material well being and perceived quality of life.
