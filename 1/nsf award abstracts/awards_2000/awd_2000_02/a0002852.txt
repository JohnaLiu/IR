Abstract    :
              A conference on "Arctic Development, Pollution and Biomarkers of Human Health"
              will be held in Anchorage, Alaska on May 1-3, 2000.  The conference is being
              organized by The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences/National
              Institute of Health (NIEHS/NIH) and the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment
              Prgramme (AMAP).

Basic environmental health research is important to protect
              the health of this region and its people.  Pollutants mobilized by ocean
              streams and air currents move globally and settle in the arctic" sink" where
              low volatilization and entrapment in ice and cold water raise concerns about
              increasing exposures.  Furthermore, bioconcentration through the food chain of
              fat-soluble pollutants makes indigenous population diets susceptible to
              untoward contamination.

The objectives of this conference are to raise
              awareness of the environmental health issues confronting the Arctic regions and
              to bring advanced scientific techniques to bear on the issues of exposure
              assessment and health effects of exposures to environmental agents.  The
              ultimate goal is to better the health of arctic populations through
              scientifically sound studies assessing possible health hazards from
              environmental contaminants.
