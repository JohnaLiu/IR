              ABSTRACT

OCE-0002391


In this project, an marine organic geochemist at
              the University of Washington will continue his long-time program of research
              into the forms, distributions and preservation of major forms of organic matter
              in marine sediments.   In particular, this present project has three major
              goals.  In its principal initiative, the research team will characterize bulk
              sedimentary organic material by a combination of solid-state 13C NMR and other
              techniques.  A special effort will be made to investigate the nature of the
              "black carbon" and the organic nitrogen abundant in sediments throughout the
              world ocean; despite their ubiquity, both are notoriously difficult to study. 
              Secondly the team will study the forms and reactions of sedimentary organic
              matter that react with oxygen.  Finally, a new molecular method for measuring
              tannins in the environment will be finished.   Such studies are important for
              understanding how carbon is cycled in the present day ocean as well as in the
              longer geological context of burial, uplift, and re-exposure to weathering and
              exploitation by humans.
