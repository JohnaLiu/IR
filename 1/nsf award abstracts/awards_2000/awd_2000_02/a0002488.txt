Abstract    :
              This project is an integrated multichannel seismic investigation of the
              intermediate-spreading Juan de Fuca Ridge.  The primary goals are:  (1) to
              determine the location, size and physical properties of crustal magma bodies
              along the ridge and relate these properties to the recent eruptive history of
              the ridge, (2) to measure the variation invelocity and thickness of the
              indicators of magmatic state, and (3) to characterize the alteration history of
              the upper crust as a function of sedimentation history, crustal age and
              basement relief.
