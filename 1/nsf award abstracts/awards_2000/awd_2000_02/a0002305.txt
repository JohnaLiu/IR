In mussels, mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) exhibits an unusual form
              of inheritance. While in most species, mitochondria are inherited strictly
              through the female gamete, this cell organelle may also be inherited through
              the male gamete in mussels. Male-inherited mitochondria are passed in sperm and
              develop only in the production of the male gonal and sperm. The presence of tow
              mDNA forms allows for the possible use of both maternal and paternal forms
              concurrently to assess population genetic structure. This study will develop
              techniques to routinely extract paternal mDNA and determine its usefulness for
              population studies. This study will focus on three species in the Cuyahoga
              River watershed, the giant floater (Pyganodon grandis), the fluted shell mussel
              (Lasmigona costata), and the wabash pigtoe (Fusconaia flava). This work has
              important implcations both for studies of mussels in general, and for the
              species in this river system which are threatened because of recent high levels
              of pollution and the invasion of the zebra mussel into the Great Lakes.
