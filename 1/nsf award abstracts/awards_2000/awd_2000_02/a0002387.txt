Abstract    :
              EPIC (Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate processes in the coupled
              ocean-atmosphere system) is an activity of the US CLIVAR Program. EPIC 2001
              consists of four components focussing on (i) intertropical convergence
              zone/warm pool phenomena; (ii) cross-equatorial inflow into the intertropical
              convergence zone; (iii) upper ocean structure and mixing and (iv) an
              exploratory study of boundary layer cloud properties in the southeasterly
              tradewind regime. The field phase of EPIC 2001 is scheduled for a 6-week period
              during the interval Sept 1 to Oct 15, 2001. In addition to the eight awards
              made by ATM, this collaborative research has awards made by NSF/OCE and
              NOAA/OGP.

Under this award (collaborative with Zehnder/Arizona State Univ
              ATM 0104234), the PI will examine factors responsible for the fluctuations in
              the strength and position of the East Pacific ITCZ on weekly time scales. The
              variations of the ITCZ convection as a function of the diurnal cycle will also
              be examined. The work is important because it will improve understanding and
              modeling of climate variability over the Eastern Tropical Pacific.
