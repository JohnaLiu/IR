Abstract    :
              This project provides radiation measurements and their interpretation during the
              ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterization Experiment - Asia) intensive field program. 
              ACE-Asia is a multi-investigator, international program designed to
              characterize the chemical properties and radiative effects of aerosols in the
              outflow from eastern Asia.  The investigator will collaborate closely with
              scientists funded by the NASA SIMBIOS (Sensor Intercomparison and Merger for
              Biological and Interdisciplinary Oceanic Studies) program who will perform a
              suite of radiation measurements and compile and interpret these data for the
              purpose of understanding the radiative effect of aerosols in the region.  The
              PI will also deploy additional radiation instruments and perform calculations
              of radiative forcing.  The results will be compared to those from INDOEX (The
              Indian Ocean Experiment).  This research is important because it may lead to
              improved understanding of the effects of pollutents from East Asia on the
              climate of that region as well as that of Pacific regions downwind of the East
              Asian coast.
