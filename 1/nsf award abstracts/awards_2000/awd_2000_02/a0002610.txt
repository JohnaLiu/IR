The purpose of this
              initiative is to understand the high field properties of high dielectric
              constant materials and determine how these properties relate to pulse power
              applications. Examples of some of the fundamental information which needs to be
              known are:  1) field distributions within dielectrics - i.e. field modeling 2)
              basic defect structure of high voltage dielectrics to mitigater ionic
              conductivity and associated electrical degradation, 3) high field dielectric
              behavior:  losses and dielectric constant, 4) the influence of macroscopic
              processing on properties 5) resonant behavior under pulsed conditions, 6)
              charging and discharging behavior under high field conditions 7) the influence
              of rapid surface discharge on high dielectric constant materials.
