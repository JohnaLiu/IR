Abstract    :
              The main objectives of this proposal are (i) to implement and validate a method
              of coupling coarse-grid global and regional climate models with a much
              finer-scale hydrologic model; (ii) to determine the minimum hydrologic model
              scale needed for realistic simulations of major hydrologic features (>  5 km)
              and (iii) to investigate the relative roles of surface versus groundwater flows
              in determining the temporal and spatial behavior of major lakes and wetlands.
              The work is important because such a coupled system is needed for paleoclimate
              and future-climate studies.
