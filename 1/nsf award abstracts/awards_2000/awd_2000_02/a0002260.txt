Abstract    :
              This proposal builds on an ongoing interdisciplinary effort to examine the
              interrelationship between enzymatic modification of water-soluble polymers and
              the resulting rheological consequences. The expanded scope of this project has
              the following objectives: (1) biochemical and biophysical characterization of
              promising wild-type and mutated hyperthermophilic galactomannanases and
              galactosidases, with respect to polysaccharide modification; (2) investigation
              of the mobility and distribution of enzymes within the biopolymer matrix during
              enzymatic modification along with the concomitant changes in the aggregation
              pattern of the biopolymer-enzyme system; and (3) correlation of enzyme activity
              to changes in rheology and galactomannan molecular architecture.  Such an
              effort, based on the collective expertise of this research team, i.e.,
              polysaccharide systems, enzymology at elevated temperatures, and the rheology
              of gels and solutions, will provide a comprehensive understanding of the
              fundamental and technological issues governing polymer modification resulting
              from enzyme action.  While the focus here is on galactomannans, the long-term
              impact of this work will extend to strategic biocatalytic approaches to enhance
              the efficacy and use of other carbohydrate biopolymers.
