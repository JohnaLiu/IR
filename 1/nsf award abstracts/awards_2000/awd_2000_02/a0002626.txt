              ABSTRACT

PI: Panagiotis D. Christofides 
Institution: University of
              California at Los Angeles
Proposal Number: 0002626

The objective of this
              research project is to develop a general and practical framework for integrated
              optimal design and control of distributed chemical processes, able to increase
              the efficiency, improve the product quality, and reduce the environmental
              impact of these processes.  The motivation for the research is provided by: (a)
              the many nonlinear distributed chemical processes, including transport/reaction
              (e.g., tubular reactors, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) systems) and
              particulate (e.g., crystallizers, emulsion polymerization and aerosol reactors)
              processes; (b) the need for optimal design and operation of these processes in
              order to minimize energy consumption and cost, achieve tighter performance
              specifications, and meet environmental and safety regulations; and (c) the lack
              of an integrated framework for design and control of distributed chemical
              processes, especially those that will minimize energy use.

The research is
              to provide a fundamental understanding of the nature of the model reduction,
              optimization and control of distributed chemical processes.  Projects to be
              done include: (a) the development of computationally efficient and accurate
              algorithms for solving steady-state and dynamic optimization problems for
              transport/reaction and particulate processes based on fundamental models; (b)
              the selection of optimal locations for control actuators and measurement
              sensors in transport/reaction processes and spatially-inhomogeneous particulate
              processes; and (c) the use of the developed methods to optimally design and
              operate tubular reactors, plasma-enhanced CVD processes and aerosol
              processes.
