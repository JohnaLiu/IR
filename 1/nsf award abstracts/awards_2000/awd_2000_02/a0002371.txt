Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support Dr. Tina Thurston will conduct three
              seasons of fieldwork in the Thy region of Denmark. She will focus on the Iron
              Age period when a state level society first emerged in this area and attempt,
              through archaeological survey, to gain insight into its organization.
              `Pristine` states which developed independently have long been a focus of
              archaeological attention because it is believed that through comparison of such
              individual cases it is possible to gain insight into the social processes which
              underlie the emergence of social and political complexity. However most
              prehistoric states do not develop in this way but result, in fact from contact
              with and response to other such pre-existing entities. Much less is known about
              this `secondary` state process and Dr. Thurston's research focuses on this
              issue. Early Danish states are also unusual because of their `corporate` nature
              where labor, food production, social groups and even rulership may be
              controlled through broad integrative ritual and ideological means and extreme
              differentiation between leaders and followers is suppressed. Centralized or
              network style government differs dramatically, stressing personal prestige,
              wealth, power accumulation and highly individualized leadership.       
              Palaces, cities, royal storehouses, temples are absent in Denmark and Dr.
              Thurston has developed a methodology to reconstruct state organization. This
              depends on reconstructing the distribution and size of individual settlements
              and determining the organizational principles which link them. To accomplish
              this goal Dr. Thurston will rely heavily on surface survey and soil chemical
              (phosphate) analysis. Prior research in Denmark, as well as other parts of the
              world indicate a close and direct tie between phosphate level in the soil and
              human occupation. Building on past NSF supported work, Dr. Thurston will
              conduct a broad scale survey, collect phosphate data, analyze diagnostic
              materials exposed on the surface. With these data she will reconstruct the
              forms and distribution of settlements, determine village social and economic
              organization and how they changed over time and examine the relationships
              between these small units and centralized political authority.
