MII:
              Infrastructure for Intelligent Mobile Information Systems

This proposal
              involves the creation of an infrastructure for research and graduate education
              in Intelligent Mobile Information Systems (IMIS) at North Carolina A&T State
              University.   The infrastructure will support the efforts by the Department of
              Computer Science, the Department of Electrical Engineering and t he College of
              Engineering to enhance the effectiveness of North Carolina A&T State University
              as a pipeline to graduate study by African-Americans in computer science and
              computer engineering.   The proposal outlines an aggressive mentoring program
              oriented toward encouraging African-American students to continue to graduate
              school.  This will involve identifying undergraduate students with high
              academic performance and recruiting them to participate in the IMIS research
              program.
