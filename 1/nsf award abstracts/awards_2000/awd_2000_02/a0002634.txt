Abstract    :
              This project will examine the range of mineral assemblages and possible
              microbial environments present within seafloor hydrothermal vent deposits, and
              observe how mineral precipitation in hydrothermal systems is affected at near
              criticl point conditions.  Focus will be on 29 selected pairs of vent
              fluid/vent solid samples collected at a diversity of vent microbial habitats
              within chimneys are affected by differences in the temperature and composition
              of the vent fluid, map pones in chimneys where different groups of microbes
              could thrive, document the effects of phase separation near the criticl point
              of water on mineral deposition.
