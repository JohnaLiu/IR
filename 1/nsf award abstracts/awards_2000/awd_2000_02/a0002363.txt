Abstract    :
              EPIC (Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate processes in the coupled
              ocean-atmosphere system) is an activity of the US CLIVAR Program. EPIC 2001
              consists of four components focussing on (i) intertropical convergence
              zone/warm pool phenomena; (ii) cross-equatorial inflow into the intertropical
              convergence zone; (iii) upper ocean structure and mixing and (iv) an
              exploratory study of boundary layer cloud properties in the southeasterly
              tradewind regime. The field phase of EPIC 2001 is scheduled for a 6-week period
              during the interval Sept 1 to Oct 15, 2001. In addition to the eight awards
              made by ATM, this collaborative research has awards made by NSF/OCE and
              NOAA/OGP.

During the field phase, the PIs will collect atmospheric
              observations at flight levels and from GPS dropsondes, and upper ocean
              observations from expendable profilers. Flights will be carried out at
              different phases of atmospheric synoptic-scale disturbances. These data sets
              will be combined with observations from the TAO moorings and satellite remote
              sensing to describe concurrent large-scale meridional-vertical structures of
              the atmospheric temperature, humidity, winds, oceanic temperature, salinity,
              currents and air-sea fluxes in the cold tongue ITCZ complex. These data will
              provide a large-scale perspective for other EPIC 2001 measurements that provide
              micro and meso-scale structure of the ocean and atmosphere in the eastern
              tropical Pacific. The work is important because it will improve understanding
              and modeling of climate variability over the eastern tropical Pacific.
