Abstract    :
              In this project, aerosol integral light scattering and 180 degree backscattering
              will be measured from the C-130 aircraft during ACE-Asia (Aerosol
              Characterization Experiment).  In addition, the extinction-to-backscatter ratio
              (lidar ratio) will be determined, a crucial parameter needed for the
              quantitative interpretation of lidar data.  It is expected to vary with air
              mass (depending on source of air, aerosol size, and chemical composition) and
              relative humidity.  Airborne measurements will provide data for a large range
              of conditions.

Measurements of aerosol optical properties, such as these are
              essential for characterizing aerosols and their role in the Earth's radiative
              balance and thus climate.
