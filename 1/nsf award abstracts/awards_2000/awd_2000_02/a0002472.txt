This U.S.-Romanian research project
              involving Shulamith Schlick at the University of Detroit,  Ileana Dragutan of
              the Center for Organic Chemistry, Romanian Academy of Sciences, and Bogdan
              Simionescu of Asachi Technical University features examination of ionomer
              systems. This U.S.-Romania team benefits from complementary expertise in ESR
              spectroscopy (Detroit), Spin probes (Bucharest) and block copolymer synthesis
              (Yassy).  Together, the researchers will seek an explanation for observed yet
              puzzling characteristics related to macromolecular organization in the membrane
              material Nafion and the organization in solvents of various polarities of ionic
              block polymers with strongly hydorphilic segments and strongly hydrophobic
              segments.
 
To accomplish this, the researchers plan to: 1) use
              perfluorinated nitroxide spin probes prepared in Bucharest to investigate
              aggregation of perfluorinated ionomers (Nafion) and 2) apply the methodology of
              ESR (electron-spin resonance) spectroscopy based on paramagnetic probes and ESR
              imaging to study self-assembly in and cation binding of block copolymers
              containing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) segments.  They'll also study
              polydimethylsiloxane-poly (methyacrylic acid) (PSMS-PMAA) blocks in the
              presence of toluene as the selective solvent for the PDMS block and water as
              the selective solvent for the PMAA block.  If successful, results should
              improve our knowledge of the microstructure of ionomers and provide new
              quantitative information about the dynamics of the different microstructural
              regions.  Findings are expected to have potential industrial applications in
              areas such as fuel cells and biomemetics. 

This international project in
              polymer research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and Central Europe to
              combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence.
