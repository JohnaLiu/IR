An ocean science community workshop will be developed and
              conducted to determine the need for and interest of the community in
              establishing an entity that would focus interest, expertise, and resources in
              ocean science education.  A concept paper has been developed for a Center for
              Ocean Science Education Excellence (COSEE).  The workshop will be developed by
              a broadly represented steering committee that will 1) set the content agenda
              for a national workshop; 2) implement a three-day workshop attended by
              approximately 70 ocean science educators and researchers; and 3) prepare a
              Workshop Report based on discussions and input from the workshop participants.
              The workshop will facilitate and encourage involvement by diverse participants
              from a wide variety of institutions undertaking ocean science education and
              research.  The report will be published in an issue of Current, the quarterly
              journal of the National Marine Educators Association, or other appropriate
              journal.
