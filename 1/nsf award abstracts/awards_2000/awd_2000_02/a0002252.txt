Abstract    :
              
This grant supports an observational study of the structure and evolution of
              boundaries between airmasses and other phenomena that indicate wind convergence
              in the atmospheric layer near the ground.  The goal is to improve the
              understanding of the properties of these boundaries and their relation to the
              initiation and development of convective clouds.  The observing network is
              situated in northern Alabama within an inhomogeneous region that includes the
              city of Huntsville and surrounding forests, farmland, and wetlands of the
              Tennessee River valley.  The observing instruments consist of the University of
              Alabama Mobile Integrated Profiling System (MIPS), three Doppler radars,
              surface meteorological stations, and a radiosonde facility.  The instruments
              will be employed continuously over a three-year period to document the
              characteristics of airmass boundaries in a wide variety of weather conditions. 
              Collaboration with the Birmingham office of the National Weather Service is
              planned, to evaluate the contributions of the fine-scale, continuous
              observations to short-term weather forecasting.
