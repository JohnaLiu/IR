Abstract    :
              The Pleasant View Farm Complex (PVFC) has been a major center for research and
              information exchange for the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study, a long-term
              ecosystem and biogeographical study of a northern hardwood forest and its
              associated aquatic ecosystems.  The study focuses on large-scale phenomena such
              as precipitation chemistry, on regional-scale phenomena such as forestry
              practices, and on demographic shifts in ecologically sensitive populations. 
              The National Science Foundation and the United States Forest Service have
              supported the study since its inception in 1963. 

This award for
              institutional planning support a series of workshops involving academic
              researchers, Forest Service staff, and facilities experts.  The objective of
              these workshops will be (1) to assess facility needs at the Pleasant View Farm
              Complex (in the context of strategic planning of science and research), (2) to
              evaluate facilities options, and (3) to develop an integrated facilities plan. 
              The institutional planning effort will result in clearly defined facilities
              program goals, site plans, schematics and construction budgeting information. 
              The award also includes a small amount of funds to assist with emergency
              repairs to the existing buildings to insure that safe working conditions are
              provided in the interim.
