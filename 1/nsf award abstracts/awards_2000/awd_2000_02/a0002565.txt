Abstract    :
              This grant will provide partial support for travel of US researchers to the
              third international university-industry-government relations conference.  The
              conference allows researchers on this topic to report results and develop
              collaborations for future research on the relations among social, economic, and
              scientific development.  The first conference was held in Amsterdam in January
              1996; the second, in New York in January 1998.  The grant will also help to
              develop a website for post-conference access and interaction, and lead to
              publication of special journal issues and a book.
