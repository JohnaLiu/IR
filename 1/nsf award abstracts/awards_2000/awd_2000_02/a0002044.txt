Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the cognitive and affective meanings of campsites
              among Australian hunters and foragers (the Pintupi of Kiwirrkura community,
              Northern Territory). It bridges the fields of Cultural Anthropology and
              Archaeology, and will contribute to models of hunter/forager behavior by adding
              data on the social constructions of the environment (place/campsites) and
              identity. The goal is to ascertain how Pintupi "read" the land, perceive
              significant categories of the environment, construct attitudes towards and uses
              of material culture, and how social relationships within the camp are expressed
              spatially. The research will examine how these process vary by gender, as well.
              Methods include participant observation, structured interviews, "travel
              histories," and mapping of sites, shelters, and storage facilities. This
              project will contribute to debates in both Archaeology and Cultural
              Anthropology regarding how hunters/foragers structure (and prehistorically
              structured) their use of resources and the environment.
