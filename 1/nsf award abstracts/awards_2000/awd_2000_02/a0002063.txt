Abstract    :
              This award helps underwrite participant travel for a workshop on freedom and
              privacy by design. The workshop is part of an interdisciplinary conference
              addressing potential effects on society and individual freedom and privacy
              resulting from the use of computers, data banks, computer networks, and
              communications systems. The workshop explores the use of technology to bring
              about strong protections of civil liberties. The exploration of technology
              includes (a) implemented, fielded systems, and (b) what principles and
              architectures should be developed, including which open problems must be
              solved, to implement and field novel systems that can be inherently protective
              of civil liberties. The workshop will take place on the first day of the
              conference, and will consist of approximately 30 active participants with a
              range of backgrounds, and about 50 spectators, including members of the press.
              The larger conference, of which this workshop is a part, addresses new
              developments and issues in the politics and intellectual property of domain
              names; developments in privacy law; security vs privacy vs free speech in
              broadband communications; the effectiveness of governmental privacy
              commissioners; ECHELON; the effect of the Internet on intellectual property;
              free expression versus privacy; the use of humans as research subjects on the
              net; Internet voting; rating and filtering systems and their effects on privacy
              and free speech; recent developments in free speech and privacy issues in the
              Pacific Rim; and the effect of the Internet on campaign finance vs free
              expression.
