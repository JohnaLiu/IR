Planning for Reform in Secondary Science and Math (PRiSSM),
              a twelve-month planning project, seeks to coordinate activities among local
              secondary schools, higher education institutions and community partners in
              southwestern Washington.  The project engages participants in (1) an assessment
              of programs, beliefs, expertise and missions across institutions; (2) building
              consensus on the alignment of programs from the point of view of both content
              and pedagogy; and (3) building consensus on core competencies for mathematics,
              science and technology education of grades 6-20.  An important outcome of the
              work will be an understanding of the local needs for professional development
              of teachers, leaders of professional development, and teacher mentors in
              science, mathematics, and technology. 

The project is managed through the
              Science and Math Education Resource Center at Educational Service District 112
              (Washington), a regional partnership among the district, Washington State
              University - Vancouver, and the Hewlett Packard Corporation.
