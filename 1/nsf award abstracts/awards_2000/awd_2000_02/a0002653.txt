The
              purpose of the Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics Conference is
              to bring together researchers in the areas of thermodynamics and statistical
              mechanics in the Midwest area for the exchange of ideas and most recent
              research results.  It is particularly designed as a platform for young
              researchers (graduate students and young faculty members) to gain confidence
              and experience in presenting and discussing their ideas and research
              accomplishments.   

 The 2000 Conference will be held May 15-16, 2000 at the
              Minnesota Supercomputing Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.  The
              four sessions include:  Phase Equilibria Adsorption, Macromolecules and
              Colloids, and Biological Systems.  The conference participants will come from
              the fields of chemical engineering, chemistry, material science and physics
