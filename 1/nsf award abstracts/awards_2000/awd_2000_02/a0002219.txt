Abstract    :
              A consortium of community colleges and universities in Ohio and Kentucky is
              using an ATE planning grant to formulate strategies for an ATE Center in
              Net-Centered Enabling Information Technologies (IT). The project institutions
              are: Lexington Community College; Jefferson Community College, Paducah
              Community College, and the College of Applied Science in Cincinnati. The
              project builds on previous projects in both Kentucky and Ohio. The idea is to
              "webify" IT using five Internet-centered areas: internet development;
              application development; networking; e-commerce; and data warehousing/mining.
              Graduates of these technical programs are able to design, develop, and
              effectively use various information technologies at net-centered businesses and
              industries.
