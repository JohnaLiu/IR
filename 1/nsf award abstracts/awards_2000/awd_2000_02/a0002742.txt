Abstract    :
              As a result of the persistent attempt to find out why American education is
              failing to fulfill many children's potential and many societal needs, many of
              the elements needed to answer the question have been identified and some of
              those have been successfully implemented.  However, work must continue on
              identifying remaining pieces of the puzzle and, especially, on how to assemble
              the pieces into a coherent whole.  Succeeding will require the construction of
              conceptual and structual bridges between scholars working at different
              distances from educational applications.

NSF's draft stategic plan includes
              the following long term outcomes, under the heading of "Ideas":

* 
              Partnerships connecting discovery to innovation, learning, and societal
              advancement.
*  Research and education processes that are synergistically
              coupled.

The WPA and APA symposia proposed herein should contribute
              meaningfully to achieving those ends buy bringing together distinguished
              scholars with expertise in diverse areas of psychology (evolutionary, social,
              cognitive, cross-cutural) and education research and policy, to stimulate
              discussion about how to improve education research and policy, to stimulate
              discussion about how to improve education by effectively integrating research
              and policy.
