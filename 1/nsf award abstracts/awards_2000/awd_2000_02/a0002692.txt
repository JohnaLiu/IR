	Dr. Elizabeth Torres, a new faculty member at California State
              University, Los Angeles, is studying the molecular evolution of bioluminescence
              in small marine crustaceans of the ostracode family Cypridinidae. Although
              bioluminescence is now known in numerous groups of organisms, including
              bacteria, dinoflagellates, coelenterates, annelids, molluscs, fireflies, and
              crustaceans, it is hypothesized to have evolved independently in all these
              groups. Cypridinids produce their own unique forms of the enzyme luciferase and
              the substrate luciferin, the molecules responsible for bioluminescence. Recent
              phylogenetic analyses of Cypridinidae, based on molecular and morphological
              data, suggest that bioluminescence evolved just once in the family (but has
              been lost or altered in various lineages). To analyze the pattern of mutational
              changes in the luciferase gene throughout the lineages of cypridinids, gene
              probes are being constructed, based on the known gene sequences from Vargula
              hilgendorfii and anticipated from clones in hand of Vargula tsujii. These can
              be used to survey gene-nucleotide differences across numerous cypridinid
              species. With several such sequences known across many taxa, one can also begin
              analyses of conserved motifs and other gene characteristics, to test the
              hypothesis that luciferases have evolved from oxygenase enzymes, in the various
              groups of bioluminescent organisms.
