Abstract    :
              This project supports the coordination of ground-based measurements during
              ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterization Experiment). In particular, the PI will: (1)
              facilitate and coordinate the activities of the US investigators at the ACE-
              Asia Supersite at Kosan, Korea; (2) to coordinate and standardize - to the
              extent possible - measurements of aerosol composition and mass at all network
              sites; (3) to assist in assuring data quality and developing a data archive for
              the network, and (4) to develop and implement plans for intercomparing samplers
              and analytical methods for the aerosol chemical characterizations. IMPROVE
              samplers will be mad available for comparisons against other types of samplers.
              The scientific objective of the ground station network is to characterize the
              spatial and temporal variability of key aerosol properties in near surface air
              over eastern Asia and the western Pacific. Asian scientists are responsible for
              site selection, site operations, and analyzing the samples collected.
