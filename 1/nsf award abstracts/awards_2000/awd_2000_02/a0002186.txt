              ABSTRACT

OCE-0002186

The neutral lipids of Emiliania huxleyii include a
              characteristic set of alkenones and related compounds with degrees of
              unsaturation influenced by growth temperature.  These compounds have attracted
              considerable interest as indicators of paleotemperature.  In this study,
              researchers at Oregon State University and California State University at Chico
              will carry out a set of laboratory investigations of these compounds in a
              variety of E. huxleyii strains.  The experiments would be designed to test the
              hypothesis that these compounds function as energy stores during growth
              limitation and following shifts in environmental conditions.  Additionally,
              they would test the hypothesis that algae with high levels of these compounds
              are nutritionally less suitable for protozoan grazers.
