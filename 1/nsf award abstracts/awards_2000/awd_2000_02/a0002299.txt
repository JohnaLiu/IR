Abstract    :
              This proposal is for research into hard open questions concerning the power of
              various complexity classes.  The work will focus on two types of questions. 
              The first deals with showing that certain famous problems are not "too easy". 
              For example, while it is widely believed that SAT requires exponential time, we
              cannot even prove that there is no linear time Turing Machine for SAT.  Our
              first work will focus on trying to prove modest lower bounds on problems such
              as SAT.

  	Second we will also investigate harder questions and attempt to
              find ways to separate complexity classes.  These are, of course, very difficult
              problems but we have a "new" approach that seems promising.  In any event we
              should be able to get some conditional results that will at least add
              additional evidence to our belief that certain classes are distinct.

	A word
              in general about this research.  We feel that it is in some sense "high" risk
              in that the problems are quite hard.  However, we feel that unless people work
              seriously on them they will never be solved.  Also we believe that our
              approaches have enough of a new slant that they may at least partially
              succeed.
