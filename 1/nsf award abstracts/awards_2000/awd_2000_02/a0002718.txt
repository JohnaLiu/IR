Abstract    :
              This project is a combined controlled source electromagnetic and magnetotelluric
              study designed to resolve unambiguously the strike direction and depth extent
              of electrical anisotropy from the near-surface through the crust and upper
              mantle.  The data collected will provide depth constraints on and alignment of
              the strain regime generated during the mid-ocean ridge crust formation,
              constraints on the extent an alignment of ductile flow during present day plate
              motion, depth of the thermal boundary layer that denotes the lithosphere, and
              insight into electrical conduction mechanisms in the mantle, particularly the
              proposal that hydrogen dissolved in olivine enhances conduction in the a-axis
              direction.
