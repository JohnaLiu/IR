Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for "An International Workshop on Submerged
              Coral Drilling".   The conference will (1) define and prioritize scientific
              objectives of submerged coral drilling, (2) identify site survey and technology
              requirements needed to optimize core recovery, (3) define sample handling, data
              management, and analytical protocols, and (4) identify groups of investigators
              that will focus their efforts on specific topics or areas. The workshop will be
              held in September, 2000, in St. Petersburg, FL, and will be co-funded by JOI,
              Inc., following review of a separate proposal to them.
