Abstract    :
              This project will make coupled chemical and temperature measurements in about 20
              high temperature vent sites on the East Pacific Rise, 9-10 degrees north, six
              diffuse flow vents, and the vents at 21 degrees north on the East Pacific Rise.
               The questions to be addressed include:  What controls the composition of vent
              fluids exiting from a single vent fore time?  Do changes in fluid compositions
              and temperatures correlate with changes in the associated animal communities? 
              What is the relationship between adjacent diffuse and focused hydrothermal
              fluids?  What is the flux of chemical species from hydrothermal vents to the
              ocean?
