The Association for Women in Science and the National Science
              Foundation will co-sponsor the Conference, "Forum on Women in Science and
              Technology", one part of the international Beijing Plus Five Conference, New
              York, 2000. The forum will be held on June 5/6, 2000. Participants will
              represent members of the scientific and technical communities, members of the
              President's Interagency Council on Women, various non-governmental
              organizations, and official delegates from various foreign countries. The goals
              of the forum are: 1) "To clarify the value and importance of science and
              technology in relation to the relevant critical areas of concern from the
              Beijing Platform for Action, and increase the visibility of women in science in
              the global arena" and 2) "To foster participation and understanding of the
              scientific community, including professionals and students, in the role they
              can play in policy initiatives such as Beijing Plus Five." The agenda focuses
              on issues of women in science and technology as they relate to education and
              training, health, the economy, power and decision-making, institutional
              mechanism, and the environment. The format includes major international
              speakers, breakout groups that focus on particular areas of concern, and the
              development of lists of action items. An exhibit that includes displays on
              women and girls in science, female science mentors, science education, and
              hands-on science material and resources will accompany the various
              presentations.
