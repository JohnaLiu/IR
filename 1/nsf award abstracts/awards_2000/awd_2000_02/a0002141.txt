              SES 00-02141 - Daniel P. Todes (Johns Hopkins University) 
"Ivan Pavlov:  A
              Life in Russian Science"

The Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936) is
              an almost legendary figure. Perhaps second only to Einstein, he (and his
              salivating dogs) has become a popular symbol of twentieth century science. This
              award enables the Principal Investigator to complete research and a draft of
              the first scholarly biography of Pavlov.

This project draws upon the
              extensive archival sources that became available in the 1990s to present a
              dramatic life story that also illuminates Pavlov's time, place, and
              preoccupations: the history of Russia and Russian science from the
              mid-nineteenth century to Stalinist times, the rise of experimental physiology
              and scientific medicine, the emergence of large-scale laboratory research, and
              the efforts of early twentieth century scientists to explain human
              behavior.

In the course of the grant period, the Principal Investigator will
              also complete an intermediate project; entitled "The Unknown Pavlov:  Reflexes,
              Revolution, and the Russian Mind," which will use recently discovered archival
              materials to explore the little-known anthropomorphic dimensions of Pavlov's
              ideas about higher nervous activity.

In view of Pavlov's scientific
              importance and iconic status in twentieth century culture, the PI hopes that
              this biography will find an audience, not only among historians of science and
              Russian historians, but also among physiologists, psychologists, and the
              educated reading public.
