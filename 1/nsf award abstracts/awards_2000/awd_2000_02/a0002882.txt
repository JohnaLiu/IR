Description:  This award is for support of a US-Egypt
              Workshop on Advanced Materials to be held in Cairo, Egypt, September 24-28,
              2000.  The US organizer is Dr. Samy El-Shall, Professor of Chemistry, Virginia
              Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.  The Egyptian co-organizer is Dr.
              Sherif Eissa, President of the National Research Center in Cairo.  The purposes
              of the workshop are to discuss jointly selected important topics in materials
              sciences and to identify specific areas where research collaboration will be
              mutually beneficial.  Individual workshop sessions will be dedicated to:
              nanostructured and nanocomposite materials, smart materials and self-assembly,
              thin films, and high performance materials (magnetic, photonics, molecular
              electronics). The final session of the workshop will be devoted to discussions
              of conclusions and future plans.  The proceedings will highlight areas
              recommended for collaborative research.
 
Scope:  This award will support a
              US-Egypt workshop in an area that is increasing in importance both in the
              United States and in Egypt.  The development of suitable materials for various
              applications is crucial for developments in industry, environmental management,
              housing, and in health service delivery.  The workshop participants will not
              only assess the current status of the field of advanced materials, but also
              will discuss cooperative research and joint projects between American and
              Egyptian scientists and engineers, and will discuss the technological and
              economic impacts of these projects.  Participants from both countries represent
              academia, government, and the private sector. The Egyptian coorganizer is the
              president of the primary government research organization in that country. 
              This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting US-foreign scientific
              collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.  Funding for this project is provided
              by the Division of International Programs, through the US-Egypt Joint Fund
              program, and by the Division of Materials Research.
