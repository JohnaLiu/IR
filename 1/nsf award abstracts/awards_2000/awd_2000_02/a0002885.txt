Abstract    :
              0002885 / Yankovsky

The PIs propose a study of various aspects of shelf
              circulation in the 
presence of coastal upwelling.  Their approach is to
              conduct further 
analysis using data collected and analyzed as part of a prior
              award.   
The data are from an experiment on the continental shelf in the
              Middle 
Atlantic Bight and included measurements from moored instruments,
              
repeated ship surveys, drifters and coastal radar.  The goals are: to
              
examine the cross-shelf pathway of upwelled water; to determine the
              
structure of the mass budget and, in particular, to determine whether 
it is
              2D or 3D; to determine the potential vorticity budget; and to 
determine the
              tidally rectified flow.
