This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring
              a ground penetrating radar (GPR) system with a set of antennas that operate at
              frequencies ranging from 25 Mhz to 100 MHz and a field-hardened laptop computer
              for research in geophysics at the State University of New York - Buffalo.  This
              system will be used together with a multi-channel seismic system for research
              on the coincident use of seismic and GPR techniques for examining the structure
              of the ultra-shallow subsurface (< 3 m).  The use of complementary geophysical
              techniques including seismic, which probes the elastic parameters of the
              subsurface, and GPR, which probes the electromagnetic properties of the
              subsurface, is a fertile area of research in environmental geophysics and
              offers promise for delineating and dealing with a variety of environmentally
              pressing problems including, the fate and transport of hazardous materials,
              groundwater resource issues, and identification of unmapped buried objects. 
              Near-surface geophysical techniques offer a non-invasive look at the
              subsurface, have clear applications to societal problems, and are important
              components of curricula for students of geophysics, particularly in urban
              environments.
