Abstract    :
              Hara
Funding is provided to develop a new model of air-sea momentum flux at
              high sea states including the enhanced drag by breaking waves. The central
              hypothesis for the work is that the momentum flux is a sum of the contribution
              by non-breaking waves (estimated by integrating the wave drag due to each
              sinusoidal component), the contribution from breaking waves (estimated by
              integrating the drag per unit length of breaking wave crests), as well as skin
              friction. Both filed and laboratory observations will be used to test the
              model. The parameters in the model will be adjusted to represent realistic open
              ocean surface wave spectra and breaking wave statistics.
