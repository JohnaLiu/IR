Funds are provided for a combination of
              analytical and numerical modeling studies of three processes involving boundary
              currents: the branching of a dense throughflow, the branching of a buoyant
              throughflow, and the generation of eddies as a boundary current encounters a
              concave curving boundary.  The motivations for these studies are the observed
              branching of the Mediterranean Sea dense outflow plume after it exits the
              Strait of Gibraltar, the branching of the Tsushima Current after it enters the
              Sea of Japan through the Tsushima Strait, and the observed generation of eddies
              consisting of Mediterranean Sea outflow water in the Gulf of Cadiz.
