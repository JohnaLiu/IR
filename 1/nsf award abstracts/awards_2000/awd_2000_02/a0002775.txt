Abstract    :
              Establishment of a National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center (I/UCRC) in Coatings at the University of Southern Mississippi
              and Eastern Michigan University is proposed.  The Center's mission will be
              two-fold: (i) to be a world leading academic organization that develops
              relevant, pre-competitive scientific knowledge for understanding and advancing
              the technologies of polymeric coatings and (ii) to enlarge the cadre of
              scientists and technologists capable of being productive in the field of
              coatings.

With this program the Center will directly address barriers that
              impede progress in coatings:  (1) a shortage of precise polymer synthetic
              methods, (2) a need to better understand film formation and molecular level
              processes that control resistance to mechanical and chemical damage, (3) a need
              to extend and develop systematic understanding of degradation processes in
              coatings, and (4) a shortage of scientists and technologists who understand
              coatings science and technology.
