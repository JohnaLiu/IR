Abstract    :
              00-02529 and 00-02543

This is an interdisciplinary study to investigate
              fundamental physical and biological processes in the Estuarine Turbidity
              Maximum (ETM) of Chesapeake Bay. ETM zones located in the upper reaches of
              estuaries, near the interface between salt and fresh water, are known to entrap
              fine sediments and to entrap or aggregate zooplankton and early-life stages of
              fish.  In Chesapeake Bay, a well-defined but poorly understood ETM occurs in
              the upper Bay. It is hypothesized that the ETM entraps sediment particles and
              planktonic organisms which in turn support enhanced zooplankton production and
              growth and survival of young anadrornous fish. This research will characterize
              constituents and evaluate processes operating in the Chesapeake ETM, including
              sediments and organisms that are of major ecological significance in the Bay. 
              A key species in the ETM is the copepod, Eurytemora affinis, which is a major
              food of larvae and juveniles of anadromous fishes (striped bass, white perch,
              shads, river herrings).
