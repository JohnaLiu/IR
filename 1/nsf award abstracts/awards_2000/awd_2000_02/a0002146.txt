Volcanic Ocean Films, Inc. is testing the viability of shooting
              large-format film of volcanic vents on the deep ocean floor.  The tests will be
              carried out during the course of the currently scheduled November, 1999, dives
              involving the deep sea submersible, Alvin, at the 9 Degree North site on the
              East Pacific Rise.  the expedition plans to shoot approximately 20,000 feet of
              15 perforation, 70-mm film resulting in approximately 10 to 20 minutes of
              footage.  The objectives of this research are:

o  To confirm the feasibility
              of lighting and filming the deep sea volcanic vents in the large film format
              from     Alvin and

o  To develop and optimize the deep water, large-format
              filming capabilities of Alvin.

The research effort is proposed on behalf of
              a consortium of US-based organizations now forming for the production of a
              40-minute, large-format film, "Volcanoes of the Abyss."
