Abstract    :
                        This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will establish the
              feasibility of performing controlled surface hardening of aluminum and its
              alloys with a novel excimer laser process.  Aluminum Alloy 319 is widely used
              in industrial applications, but does not have the hardness necessary for many
              wear resistant applications.  This alloy cannot be hardened by conventional
              means.  This project will investigate the potential for creating an aluminum
              nitride surface layer by highly controlled energy input to the surface which is
              exposed to a nitrogen environment.  There are several metallurgical issues that
              make this a high risk endeavor.  Early work in thermal laser glazing provided
              some of the first evidence of modified forms of aluminum.  For the process to
              be successful, an aluminum nitride layer must form and must be contiguous with
              the aluminum.  This requires thermodynamic balancing of the energy input with
              the metallurgical events taking place.  Other elements in the aluminum alloy
              could retard the formation of the aluminum nitride, or limit the thickness and
              /or integrity of the hard layer.  If the appropriate control of the processing
              parameters can be identified and maintained, it is expected that the hardness
              of the aluminum surface could be increased by as much as twelvefold.

       
                The surface hardening of aluminum alloys is highly desired for automotive and
              aerospace applications, and if the feasibility of the process is established,
              further research would need to be conducted into limits of applicability,
              durability, and range of alloys appropriate for laser hardening.
