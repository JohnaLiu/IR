Abstract    :
              This project involves the chemical characterization of organic aerosols
              collected during the ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterization Experiment - Asia)
              intensive field program.  ACE-Asia is a multi-investigator, international
              program designed to characterize the chemical properties and radiative effects
              of aerosols in the outflow from eastern Asia.  Specific organic tracers will be
              analyzed in samples collected during the field program.  These tracers are
              chosen to indicate sources such as urban, petroleum, biomass burning,
              microbial, plant waxes, higher plants, lignins, cellulose, etc.  The analysis
              technique is based on extraction and GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass
              spectrometry).  This information will be used, along with related data, to
              infer aerosol sources and source regions.  Samples will be collected at Kosan,
              Korea, and possibly other ground sites in Asia, as well as with the Total
              Aerosol Sampler on the C-130 aircraft in collaboration with Dr. Huebert
              (University of Hawaii, ATM-0002698)
