A National Science Foundation I/UCRC on Fundamentals
              and Applications of Photopolymerizations that will be housed jointly at the
              University of Iowa and the University of Colorado.  The new center is motivated
              by the fact that photopolymerizations offer tremendous advantages over
              traditional thermal processing methods, including low energy requirements,
              spatial and temporal control of initiation, and high polymerization rates. 
              These advantages have led to tremendous growth in applications of
              photopolymerizations in areas such a solvent-free processing, biomedical
              materials, and high-technology devices; however, much of this growth is
              occurring without a fundamental understanding of the underlying photochemical
              processes.  Hence, there is a critical need to establish an active dialogue
              between academic and industrial researchers.  The objective of the center are
              1) to advance the fundamental understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms of
              photopolymerizations; 2) to establish a venue for active discussions and
              collaborations among industrial and academic researchers; 3) to explore
              high-risk, cutting-edge research on photopolymerization processes that could
              lead to technological innovations; and 4) to promote and/or develop novel
              applications that exploit the unique set of advantages offered by
              photopolymerizations.
