Abstract    :
              Two major issues associated with the formation of oceanic crust via upward flow
              of melt will be investigated.  First, three-dimensional imaging and numerical
              methods will be combined to quantify the permeability of partially molten upper
              mantle rocks.  Second, the spontaneous localization of melt into channels
              during deformation will be explored through high-strain shear experiments on
              partially molten upper mantle rocks.  The research will provide important
              constraints on and quantificaiton of melt distribution and permeability beneath
              a mid-ocean ridge.
