Abstract    :
              This LTREB project will support data collection on weekly recruitment patterns
              of a taxonomically diverse assemblage of benthic epifaunal invertebrates common
              to the southern New England coastal zone. Over the five year study period, data
              will be added to address (a) whether short-term, week?to?week variability in
              recruitment is tidally controlled, (b) whether recent invasive species differ
              in the timing, intensity, or duration of the recruitment period relative to
              resident species, and (c) whether annual fluctuations in water temperature
              affecting the timing and intensity of recruitment for a variety of species with
              different life history types. By collecting new data on larval abundances and
              additional environmental variables, the following will also be examined: (a)
              whether larval supply, recruitment and adult abundance are correlated, (b)
              whether taxa with short?living (lecithotrophic) larvae exhibit a greater degree
              of local control of recruitment than taxa with longer?lived (planktotrophic)
              larvae, and (c) whether inter?annual variability in recruitment is correlated
              with other environmental variables such as salinity, dissolved oxygen or
              chlorophyll a ('food) levels. Collectively, these measurements will provide a
              long-term database on the responses of marine organisms to changing
              environmental conditions (e.g., global temperature warming) and the detection
              of new species that are introduced into the region. In addition to these more
              applied benefits, understanding the role of larval supply and recruitment is a
              widely appreciated step in understanding why and how adult populations of
              marine organisms fluctuate through space and time. Data will also be available
              to the research community for use in modeling investigations or
              meta?analyses.
