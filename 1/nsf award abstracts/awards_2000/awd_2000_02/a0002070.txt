Abstract    :
              This project will measure the microphysical and optical properties of
              atmospheric aerosols during the Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE)-Asia
              intensive field program.  The instrument package that will be placed on board
              the NCAR C-130 will include measurements of bulk aerosol properties, size
              distributions, scattering coefficients, and aerosol nucleation and evolution. 
              These measurements along with related satellite data and chemical transport
              models will help to relate measured aerosol properties to air mass
              characteristics and to identify sources and source regions.
