Abstract    :
              The renewed interest into cold cathode emitters is due to their potential
              applications for a variety of electronic devices, including microwave vacuum
              transistors and tubes, pressure sensors, thin panel displays, high temperature
              and radiation tolerant sensors, Hall thrusters, and electrodynamic tethers,
              among others.  Introduction of such emitters would permit an unprecedented
              compactness and weight reduction in device equipment design.
