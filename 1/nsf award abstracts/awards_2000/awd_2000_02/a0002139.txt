As the field of electromagnetics has matured, it has become
              evident that the opportunity for significant contributions in this field is
              concentrated in multidisciplinary and collaborative efforts.  Examples of this
              include recent advances in wireless communications, radio-frequency
              micro-machining and MEMS technology, low-cost antenna arrays and
              re-configurable apertures and low-power and high-frequency electronics.  It
              seems likely that future advances in these and similar fields will be fueled if
              scientists are exposed to relevant work in different disciplines where their
              own work may be applicable.  The funding received in response to this proposal
              will facilitate organization of special sessions at the 2000 IEEE International
              Symposium on Antennas and Propagation and USNC/URSI National Radio Science
              Meeting that foster this interaction.  By working with carefully selected
              organizers for these special sessions, the Technical Program Committee will
              identify leading researchers in academia, government, and industry as potential
              keynote speakers and use the funds to cover expenses associated with bringing
              them to the conference.  By providing this opportunity for interaction,
              researchers and practitioners will be able to better understand new directions
              that their work may take in order to solve many of the important technological
              challenges that lie in interdisciplinary research.
