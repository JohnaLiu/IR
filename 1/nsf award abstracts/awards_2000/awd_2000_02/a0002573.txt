This project explores
              gender differences in hopes and expectations regarding close relationships. 
              Respondents between the ages of 28 and 35 will be interviewed regarding three
              dimensions of relationships: practices, ideals, and expectations.  Results will
              be used to test hypotheses regarding how individuals make sense of their
              relationships, as well as some anticipated differences in the ways women and
              men structures their beliefs and practices.  Life history analyses will capture
              biographical details and perceptions as women and men account for their views
              and experiences.  Results will add to understanding of communication patterns,
              experiences, and gender differences in views of what close relationships mean,
              and what they should be.
