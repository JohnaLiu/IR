Abstract    :
              The New Jersey Center for Advanced Technological Education and other NSF Centers
              of Excellence are investigating activities required to implement change in
              technician education. The activities are capitalizing on the experience that
              reformers have had in successfully implementing model programs by providing a
              forum where people behind successful ATE centers and projects can articulate
              the pathways to change. A Steering Committee is exploring the most effective
              means of encouraging and supporting adoption of innovative programs and
              practices. In addition to ATE principal investigators, the Steering Committee
              also includes industry representatives, a researcher on two-year college
              programs, an evaluator, and two external members. Avenues for disseminating
              results include conferences, mentoring, interactions with professional
              societies and accreditation boards, and publications.
