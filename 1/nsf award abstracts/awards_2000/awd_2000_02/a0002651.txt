Abstract    :
              This project will analyze the impacts of climate and environmental change on
              land and marine productivity and sustainability in the North Atlantic region
              around Iceland.  Historical records from Iceland describe fisheries catches and
              hay and farm stock strategies over the last century.  These will be evaluated
              in conjunction with climate, environmental, and oceanographic records to see if
              associated changes occur.  Socio-economic factors will be evaluated by surveys
              of farmers and fishers.  The project will contribute to our understanding of
              linkages between climate, ecosystem productivity and socio-economic adaptation
              and this understanding will allow better prediction of future climate change
              impacts.
