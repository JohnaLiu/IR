Abstract    :
              This interagency transfer to the Department of State is made to cover the
              Administrative Costs of the NSF Offices housed at the U.S. Embassy in Paris and
              Tokyo.

This contribution by NSF represents a partial payment for FY 2000, it
              reflects an estimate of about 80% of the total costs.  The Department of State
              will send an adjusted bill by the end of July, which NSF will have to pay by
              supplementing the present award.
