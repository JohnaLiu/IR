Project Summary 

Structural Genomics efforts aim to ultimately provide
              an experimental structure or good theoretical model of every tractable protein
              encoded by all sequenced genomes. Major efforts in this direction are now
              beginning, and the PRESAGE database aids coordination among groups and
              dissemination of results. PRESAGE records experimental structure determination
              underway (experimental annotations) and structural predictions & models
              (prediction annotations). As such, it provides the potential for a mechanism
              for coordination among different researchers without requiring centralization.
              It also aids in the broad dissemination of both experimental and computational
              structural genomics to a broad audience of biologists.  This project will
              re-engineer PRESAGE from a "proof-of-concept" prototype to a robust and
              reliable system. Most significantly, this will involve re-writing the whole
              database access system, comprising most of PRESAGE except the user interface.
              In addition, several specific new aspects are planned, including customized
              systems for data collection (designed in collaboration with structural genomics
              researchers); family neighboring facilities; broader data collection; and
              flexible query systems with parseable output.
