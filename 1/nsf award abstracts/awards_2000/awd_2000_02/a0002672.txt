Recommended project is for an integrated
              sampling and survey study of four serpentine mud seamount volcanoes on the
              Mariana forearc, designed to place constraints on the nature of the
              pressure/temperature conditions in the subduction decollement zone and in the
              overlying mantle wedge.  The research will also study mass transfer processes
              from the decollement and slab to the overlying mantle at slab depths of 15-29
              km, including dehydration and other fluid-rock reactions that occur during
              metamorphic processes.  The investigation will center around analysis of
              entrained metamorphic fluids and high-pressure, low-temperature metamorphic
              rock samples brought up by buoyant mud upflow in the seamount serpentinite mud.
               Fluid, mud, and rock samples will be collected by the remotely-operated
              vehicle (ROV) Jason, providing geological control of sample localities.  Sample
              collection will be set within a framework defined by mapping of the mud
              volcanoes by the DSL-120 deep-tow, side-scan sonar.  These studies will
              constrain key parameters controlling forearc seismicity.
