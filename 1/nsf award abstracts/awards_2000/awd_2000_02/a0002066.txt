	This award provides partial funding support for the
              operation and maintenance of the Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array (PANGA), a
              network of continuously recording geodetic quality Global Positioning System
              (GPS) station distributed in the Pacific Northwest. Each station of the network
              is capable of measuring its position to better than several millimeters and the
              network is capable of detecting relative motion down to several millimeters per
              year. Data gathered by the PANGA network will form the basis for interpreting
              the tectonic framework of the Pacific Northwest, with its active volcanism,
              subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate under the North American plate, as well as
              the region's earthquake potential.
