Special Project: 
              Connecting Minority Educators by Enhancing Minority Participation in NECC
              2000

This project supports the travel and registration of 115 K-16
              educators
affiliated with selected Historically Black Colleges and
              Universities,
Minority and Minority Serving Institutions, to the National
              Educational
Computing Conference (NECC) to be held in June 2000 in Atlanta
              Georgia.
The NECC is one of the largest K-16 educational technology
              conferences that
attracts more than 8000 educators and 3000 exhibitor
              personnel.  The
anticipated outcome of NECC attendance is the formation of a
              network of
educators in K-12 and higher education that would share ideas and
              knowledge
regarding the use of learning technologies in their classrooms. 
              Through
coordinated, structured activities, this project will demonstrate
              increased
minority participation in NECC, increased use of technologies in
              targeted
K-16 schools, and increased benefits (e.g. panels, papers,
              programmatic
initiatives) from partnerships between K-12 schools and the
              selected higher
education institutions.
