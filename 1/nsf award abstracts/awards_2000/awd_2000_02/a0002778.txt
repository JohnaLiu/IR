Abstract    :
              As part of the TIMSS-R video study, nationally representative videotape samples
              of eighth-grade science lessons are being collected in five countries--the
              Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Japan, Australia, and the United States.  The
              first three of these were among the highest performing countries on the TIMSS
              science achievement tests.  Collection of the data is already funded by NCES. 
              We are seeking funding to prepare, code, analyze, and interpret the data in
              order to provide the first cross-national descriptions of science teaching.  We
              further propose to carry out these processes in a way that maximizes usability
              of the data in future research and improvement efforts.
