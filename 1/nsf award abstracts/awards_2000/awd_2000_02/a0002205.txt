Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for the support of the 2000 National Engineers Week
              Teleconference for Middle and High School Students.  The eleventh annual
              Discover Engineering!  Teleconference entitled, "Engineers Turning Ideas into
              Reality," will be broadcast nationwide during National Engineers Week on
              Wednesday, February 23, 2000.  The purpose of this teleconference is two-fold. 
              First, the program provides U.S. middle and high school students and their
              teachers with an interesting insight into the work and career opportunities of
              engineers in a novel teleconference setting.  Second, the Discover Engineering!
              telecast serves as the centerpiece of community open houses at many industrial,
              government and college locations.
