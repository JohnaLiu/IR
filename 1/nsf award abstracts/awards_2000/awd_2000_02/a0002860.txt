Abstract    :
              This project is an extension of the PI's earlier NSF INDOEX project (Curry and
              Liu: Application of airborne passive microwave measurements for INDOEX,
              ATM-9910640).  Because Airborne Imaging Microwave Radiometer (AIMR) was
              originally designed for sea ice observations in the polar region, their first
              task was to assess the suitability of using AIMR for cloud retrievals in the
              "hot" environment of INDOEX.  Their study showed that the data are of good
              quality and retrieved values of cloud liquid water path are within the expected
              range.  Therefore, they concluded that these data can be used to conduct
              research on INDOEX related science issues.  The purpose of the present study is
              to analyze the cloud water characteristics in relation to anthropogenic
              aerosols using AIMR and other ancillary data collected during 1999 INDOEX field
              experiment.  This project supports INDOEX primary scientific objectives by
              providing information on horizontal distributions of liquid water path and
              characteristic cloud particle size (together with using airborne visible
              measurements) for low-level clouds, to aid in the interpretation of the
              indirect effect of aerosols on the radiative fluxes.  This work is important
              because it will contribute to enhanced understanding of the influence of
              aerosols on climate change.
