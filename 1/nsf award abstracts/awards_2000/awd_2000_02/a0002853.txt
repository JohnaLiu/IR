Abstract    :
              This Americas Program award supports a regional workshop entitled "Cell and
              Molecular Aspects of the Birth, Life and Death of the Nervous System." The
              workshop is organized by Dr. Lester I. Binder, Northwestern University, and Dr.
              Ricardo Maccioni, University of Chile, and Dr. Alfredo Caceres, University of
              Cordoba, and will be held October 4-7, 2000 in Pucon, Chile.  The general topic
              is cellular and molecular neuroscience with a specific focus on the
              cytoskeleton and its role in neural polarity, endocytosis and vesicular
              trafficking, neurite extension, vesicular transport, signalling events, and
              neurodegeneration.  Scientists from the United States, Latin America, and
              Europe who are members of the American Society for Cell Biology, the AAAS, and
              of the Ibero-American Molecular Biology organization (IMBO) will be among the
              attendees. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will constitute a
              significant number of meeting participants and will present their work in
              poster sessions.  Given the variety of topics and the strengths of the
              speakers, the workshop is expected to enhance U.S.-Latin American
              collaboration.
