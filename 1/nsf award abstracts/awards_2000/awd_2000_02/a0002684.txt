Abstract    :
              Delaney/00-02684:  This award provides funding to continue the "REVEL Project",
              a program initiated at the University of Washington (UW) in 1996, as an
              outreach and teacher professional development program. The program will include
              twelve K-12 teachers from a variety of  states in a suite of activities related
              to ongoing research on hydrothermal vent systems of the Endeavour and Juan de
              Fuca mid-ocean ridge systems.  The teachers will participate in cruises aboard
              the R/V THOMPSON or the R/V ATLANTIS and will have first-hand experience
              working on sea-going oceanographic research. They will work with the
              submersible ALVIN or an autonomous underwater vehicle called ABE. In addition,
              they will participate in pre and post-cruise workshops to ensure that the
              experiences they gain at sea can be translated to their students and other
              classrooms. The overall goal of the project is to encourage collaboration and
              partnerships between research groups and science educators.
