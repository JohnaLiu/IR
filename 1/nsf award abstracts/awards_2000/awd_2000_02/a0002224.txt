Abstract    :
              This research is aimed at developing dating techniques for African
              archaeological sites that are too old to be dated by radiocarbon (>45,000 years
              before present) and which lack appropriate volcanic materials for
              high-precision argon-argon dating. The methods may also help to resolve
              problems of chronology and disturbance in archaeological sites. Such
              chronological resolution is essential if we are to understand such issues as
              the African origins of modern humans and the origins of modern behavior, both
              of which may relate back to the time period of the late Middle and upper
              Pleistocene (40,000-200,000 years before present) and the associated Middle
              Stone Age culture.  The proposed research would improve the precision of amino
              acid racemization dating of ostrich eggshell (one of the more common materials
              in archaeological sites), through analysis of patterns of spatial and temporal
              variation in temperature at six African sites in Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia
              and South Africa.  Knowledge of the Pleistocene temperature histories of these
              sites will also indicate how each region (tropical vs. temperate zones)
              reflected global cooling and warming patterns during the late Pleistocene and
              allow evaluation of human response to these climatic variations.
