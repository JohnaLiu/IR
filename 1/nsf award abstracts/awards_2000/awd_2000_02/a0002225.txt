Abstract    :
              The research project will study the diffusion of a series of linguistic changes
              across the Mid-Atlantic region from New York City to Baltimore. The Atlas of
              North American English shows that this region exhibits many common features and
              changes in progress: the lexical split of short /a/ and /o/ into tense and lax
              classes; the raising of long open /oh/ to high and mid position, the lowering
              of short /e/ and the raising of checked /ey/, and the vocalization of /l/.
              Sociolinguistic studies will be carried out within previously studied urbanized
              areas to provide real-time confirmation of reports of change in progress. To
              study geographic diffusion from these centers, the project will use short
              sociolinguistic interviews in 60 smaller cities and towns. The goal is to
              discover which patterns of diffusion--hierarchical or contagious
              transmission-are characteristic of which linguistic variables as changes spread
              from one community to another. Data on the geographic distribution of these
              changes, coupled with information on patterns of mobility and migration, will
              help resolve the question of how social change is coupled with linguistic
              change.
