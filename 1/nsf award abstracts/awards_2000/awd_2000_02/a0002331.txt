The intent of this study is to use a novel instrument, the
              
Electromagnetic Vorticity Meter, to directly measure the flow vorticity
              
which, in combination with the Stokes drift associated with the surface
              
waves, gives rise to the "vortex force," identified by theoretical
              
explanations of roll vortices in the mixed layer (Langmuir cells) as the
              
primary cause of these vortices.   An additional objective is to 
determine
              which component of vorticity, vertical or horizontal, is most 
critical for
              Langmuir cell formation and hence distinguish between 
competing theories. 
              The vorticity measurements will be supplemented 
with observations of
              temperature, salinity and turbulence parameters.  
While theories of Langmuir
              cells have existed for a long time, direct 
verification of their central
              hypotheses with field observations has 
been lacking because of the difficulty
              of directly measuring vorticity 
in the mixed layer.  This study holds out the
              possibility of being able 
to make such measurements.  A better understanding
              of Langmuir cells 
will help oceanographers develop a clearer picture of
              mixing in the 
upper few meters of the ocean and may lead to improved
              representations 
of such mixing in computer models of oceans and climate.
