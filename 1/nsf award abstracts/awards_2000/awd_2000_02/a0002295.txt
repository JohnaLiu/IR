This project is an attempt to provide a better understanding of 
(a)
              processes determining the structure, distribution and scale 
content of the
              oceanic mesoscale field and (b) the role of mesoscale 
eddies in determining
              the large-scale structure of the ocean, looking 
in turn at the structure of
              the thermocline, abyssal flows, and 
structure of the mid-depth flows below
              the base of the thermocline.  
The physical effects that will be considered
              are broad-ranging and 
include, wind-forcing, mesoscale instabilities of large
              scale flows, 
the response of the ocean to stochastic forcing, adiabatic
              advection 
(ventilated thermocline dynamics), and eddy-topography
              interactions.  
The approach will be a combination of theory and numerical
              simulations.  
Much of the numerical simulation will be with stratified
              quasi-
geostrophic models although some will use a primitive equation model
              
(MOM4).  The project will begin by looking at the life-cycles of 
baroclinic
              eddies in a broad, baroclinically unstable, wind-driven 
flow, studying their
              equilibration and the scaling of the vertical 
structure of the equilibrated
              eddies.  The effects of inhomogeneity 
will be studied by stochastically
              forcing a quasigeostrophic model 
linearized about a time-mean wind-driven
              gyre.  The project will go 
on to look at the role of the planetary and
              topographic vorticity 
gradients in introducing anisotropies in the nonlinear
              cascade of 
eddy energy in wavenumber space, leading to coherent and energetic
              
deep flows.  Lastly the role of mesoscale eddies in establishing the
              
vertical structure of the thermocline will be examined using a 
primitive
              equation model.
