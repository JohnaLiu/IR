This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in an U.S.-Japan workshop and study effort to identify opportunities for
              improving science and technology relations between the U.S. and Japan, to be
              held in the spring of 2000.  The co-organizers are Dr. Rodney W. Nichols,
              President, New York Academy of Sciences and Professor Imura, Executive Member
              of the Council for Science and Technology and Chairman of the Committee on
              Science, Technology and Society in Japan.  The meeting will focus on areas of
              science and technology that will contribute to emerging or growing societal
              priorities in our nations. In their statement of April 4, l999 President
              Clinton and Prime Minister Obuchi noted that they considered this area as both
              urgent and important.  The participants will focus on areas in which there is
              clear, mutual benefit from strengthening the bilateral partnership, with
              emphasis on the value of collaboration in science and technology.  Special
              emphasis will be placed on areas, which are of particularly high societal
              concern.  These areas will also be discussed at the intergovernmental
              U.S.-Japan High Level Committee Meeting, chaired by the President's Science
              Advisor and the Japanese Minister for Science and Technology in May 2000.
