The proposed research agenda stresses understanding, at
              the molecular level, the effects of processing on critical quality attributes
              of pharmaceutical products and on minimizing validation requirements through
              improved process monitoring.  Representative research projects will include
              improved process monitoring technology, blending of pharmaceutical powders,
              application of Near-IR to pharmaceutical testing, solid state properties,
              formulations development, extruder/marumerizar technology, compaction process,
              innovative analytical methods for validation, dissolution and bio-availability,
              tablets coating and disperse systems.
