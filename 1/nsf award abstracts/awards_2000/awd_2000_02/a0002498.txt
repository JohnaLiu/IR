              ABSTRACT:

OPP-0002498
"Relations between Traditional and Scientific
              Knowledge of the Kotzebue Sound Ecosystem: Exploratory Research"

This
              exploratory research by an interdisciplinary team involves visiting with
              Inupiaq leaders in the Kotzebue Sound area to begin a dialog with local Arctic
              communities about the possibilities for long-term ecosystem research. Within
              the framework of the Human Dimensions of the Arctic System (HARC) initiative,
              researchers will consult with communities as an important preliminary step in a
              collaborative effort to study environmental change in Northwest Alaska.
