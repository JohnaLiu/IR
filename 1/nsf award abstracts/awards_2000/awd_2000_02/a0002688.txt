Abstract    :
              The Atmospheric Angular Momentum (AAM) is a robust and convenient index of the
              atmosphere's zonal-mean dynamics; diagnostic studies of the behavior of AAM and
              its attendant zonal-mean zonal wind field u, on climate time scales, in both
              observations and models, continue to be of widespread interest and relevance.
              The PIs propose to continue AAM diagnostics using output from various GCMs. 
              The topics are (i) seasonal and interannual variability of AAM in  the AMIP2
              simulations; (ii) multidecadal variability of simulated AAM (iii) 'Double CO2'
              experiments. The work is important because it will increase understanding of
              the role of AAM in the climate system.
