Abstract    :
                   Sport Science addresses the needs of urban girls in gaining equitable
              access to science/mathematics education.  Through sports, girls will not only
              develop science/mathematics discourse, but will build rapport and trust, thus
              achieving both an intellectual advancement in science/mathematics and a
              psycho-social-emotional connection.  The overall goal of the program is to
              design, implement, evaluate, and disseminate a field-based program for
              fostering the resilience of girls in science/mathematics through the vehicle of
              sports.
     The project is designed as a three-year intervention involving
              540 girls from six middle schools over a three-year period, teachers, college
              students, minority athletes, and mentors.  The sport science curriculum will be
              standards based and have an equitable focus.  The entire curriculum will
              include 40 science/ mathematics standards driven activities that feature a
              sport as the vehicle through which the science/ mathematics is learned.  The 10
              sports to be featured in the program include:  (1) five team sports -
              volleyball, basketball, soccer, hockey, and softball; and (2) five individual
              sports - fencing, golf, tennis, track (running and throwing).  The project will
              achieve the goals and objectives through five components:  (1) after school
              programs, (2) Saturday academies, (3) special sport day events, (4) academic
              and summer internships, and (5) career connections.
