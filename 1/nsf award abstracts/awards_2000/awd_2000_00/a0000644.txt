Abstract    :
              0000644  Gray  This is an award to support exploratory research on the ways in
              which metal oxide surfaces mediate the interactions between ionizing radiation
              and organic compounds particularly those with large oxidation-reduction
              potentials such as hexachlorobenzene.  Specific objectives are to determine how
              oxide surfaces affect reaction rates induced by ionizing radiation and to
              relate band energy of metal oxides to surface adsorption and rate of chemical
              transformations that are induced by ionizing radiation.  The investigator also
              plans on applying knowledge gained in the initial phases of this project to
              explore its application for decontamination of liquids and solid materials used
              in production processes for potential reuse in production and in determining
              the feasibility of radiation-induced metal oxide catalysis in accelerating
              radiolysis for decontamination of contaminated soils and solutions.  The
              proposal leading to this award was submitted to NSF under the Special
              Guidelines for an SGER (Small Grant for Exploratory Research) in the NSF Grant
              Proposal Guide (NSF 00-2).  Results of this research are expected to provide
              the basis for further research on the potential for use of radiolysis in
              decontamination of contaminated soils and sediments.  ***
