Abstract    :
              Under this US-Brazil-Canada dissertation enhancement research award, Sarah M.
              Stai, under the sponsorship of William A. Searcy of the University of Miami,
              will work with Regina H. F. Macedo of the University of Brasilia in Brazil and
              Frank Rohwer at the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station in Portage la
              Prairie in Canada.  They will study the promiscuity and sperm competition in
              Muscovy ducks.  This project has three objectives: 1) to characterize
              male-female associative patterns through behavioral observations and to
              estimate the number of mates through DNA analysis; 2) to explore why this
              species is an exception to the rule of monogamy in waterfowl through
              cost-benefit analysis, a comparative approach, and hypothesis testing; and 3)
              to test the passive sperm loss model, a proposed mechanism for sperm
              competition. 

The elucidation of the adaptive significance of promiscuity
              and an ability to predict the outcome of sperm competition will lead to a
              better understanding of Muscovy duck reproductive strategies and of mating
              system evolution in waterfowl.  The field research will be done in Brazil and
              the captive research will be done in Canada.  This project will provide
              benefits to research, teaching, and wildlife management and conservation.
