Abstract    :
              A new ultra low temperature refrigerator, the superfluid Joule-Thomson
              refrigerator  (SJTR), will be developed. The SJTR is a single-phase
              refrigerator that can be used in zero gravity as well as terrestrial
              environments.  It is projected to provide cooling to temperatures of 0.5 Kelvin
              (K). 

The SJTR uses a cold (~1 K) superleak-bypassed piston compressor to
              compress the 3He component of a 3He-4He liquid mixture .  In the SJTR cycle,
              the compressed  3He is discharged by the compressor and passed through
              counterflow heat exchangers to a superleak bypassed throttle.  The 3He
              component of the mixture cools as it passes through the throttle and the fluid
              is used to absorb heat from a thermal load.  The 3He component is warmed back
              up to the compressor temperature by passing back through the counterflow heat
              exchanger.  The 3He is then recompressed  in the compressor where it continues
              back through the cycle. 

The project will include the development of the
              cold compressor and a demonstration of the superfluid Joule- Thomson concept.
