Title:  Stationary Wave
              Maintenance and Sensitivity to Climate Change in GCMs

The primary objective
              of the proposed work is to understand how climatological stationary waves are
              maintained in the AMIP-2 participating GCMs and how stationary waves respond to
              greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere. A secondary objective is to
              understand the linkage between the trend in the Arctic Oscillation(AO) which is
              the leading mode of the month-to-month variability in Northern Hemisphere sea
              level pressure, and the stationary wave changes in response to green house gas
              increases. The research is motivated by the fact that stationary waves
              determine regional climate conditions and are hence a key determinant of
              regional climate change. Different GCMs tend to give inconsistent regional
              climate simulations and regional climate predictions. These differences arise
              primarily because of differences in model physical parameterizations, in
              particular the convective parameterization schemes. The work is important
              because it will lead to better understanding into how best  to utilize
              information provided by GCM experiments using greenhouse gas forcing.
