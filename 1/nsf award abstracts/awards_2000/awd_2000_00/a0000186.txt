Abstract    :
              Research on diving physiology of aquatic birds and mammals began as early as the
              mid-1800's, but major advances in the field were not made until the late 1930's
              and early 1940's. Since that time, there has been an intense interest in the
              field, with studies focused on the physiology, biochemistry, behavior and
              ecology of this group of organisms. Most of the research has focused on
              seabirds and marine mammals, while fewer studies have been conducted on
              turtles, crocodiles and sea snakes. Gerald Kooyman has been a pioneer in
              developing techniques to study diving animals in the wild. His studies of the
              physiological adaptation and biochemical mechanisms of diving in Antarctic
              penguins and seals resulted in landmark papers. This symposium in his honor
              will bring together a distinguished group of international scientists to
              discuss to their work in the fields of physiology, behavior, ecology,
              biochemistry, and conservation. Topics to be discussed include be the diving
              physiology of dolphins, the feeding ecology of baleen whales, the diving
              behavior of leatherback sea turtles, the behavior of sea lions, the ecological
              energetics of fur seals and the biomedical significance and application of
              diving ecology. The symposium's schedule will provide time for interactions
              between the speakers and students. Papers presented at the symposium will be
              made available to the scientific community through publication in the journal
              Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology.
