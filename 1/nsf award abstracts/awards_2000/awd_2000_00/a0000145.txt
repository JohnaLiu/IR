Abstract    :
              Reaction involving formaldehyde (CH2O) and formyl (HCO) radical lie on the
              primary oxidation pathway for methane and other funds, but there are still
              large uncertainties in the high-temperature rate coefficients of key  reactions
              involving these species.  This uncertainty stems largely from instability to
              measure CH2O and HCO with sufficient sensitivity.  To address this situation,
              sensitive optimal diagnostics to measure CH2O and HCO are developed and used to
              measure important rate coefficients from shock-tube studies.  Formaldehyde is
              measured using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lamp absorption at 174 nm.  Formyl is
              measured using frequency modulation (FM) laser absorption at 614 nm.  These
              techniques are applied to the investigation of several elementary reactions in
              shock-tube studies and species concentration time-history databases from
              pyrolysis and oxidation experiments.
