This planning grant funds the Colorado School of Mines
              for industry/university interactions to determine the feasibility and viability
              of becoming a research site of the Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center (I/UCRC) for Membrane Applied Science and Technology.  The Co-Directors
              of the site would be Dr. Robert Baldwin and Dr. Douglas Way.

The Colorado
              School of Mines expertise will broaden the Center's research base by addressing
              research in Sample Membrane Interactions Using Field Flow Fractionation,
              Separation of Gene-Therapy Products with Field Flow Fractionation, Cyclodextrin
              Modified Adsorbents and Membranes for Chiral Separations, Cell-Bacteria Sorting
              Using Laser Tweezers, Switchable Selective Channels in Porous Materials for
              Separations, Separation and Fractionation of Viral Precursers by Field Flow
              Fractionation, Membrane Reactor for Methanol/Ethanol Reforming, The Influence
              of Free Volume on the Permeation and Sorption in Super-Glassy Polymers,
              Faujasite Membranes for CO2/N2 Separations and Fundamentals of Nanofiltration
              at High Composition.
