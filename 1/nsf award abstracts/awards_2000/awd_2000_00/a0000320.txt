Cost sharing is provided to continue supporting
              interagency activities to encourage and facilitate productivity in the areas of
              marine science research and education.  This funding supports a science
              assistant to the Research Vessel Clearance Officer at State Dept.  The research
              vessel clearance office provides guidance to embassy personnel, heads of
              research institutions and government agencies, and other individuals, regarding
              the implementation of international and U.S. marine policy.  The office manages
              the procedure for arranging international access for U.S. marine scientific
              research. With the support provided by the science assistant position, the
              research community obtains an additional point of contact at the State
              Department through which necessary clearances can be arranged in a timely
              fashion. Owing to the ever increasing reporting and compliance requirements
              invoked by foreign counties for granting clearances to conduct ocean research
              projects in their exclusive economic zones, and the past effectiveness of the
              science assistant, this remains an important support activity for effectively
              conducting global ocean science research.
