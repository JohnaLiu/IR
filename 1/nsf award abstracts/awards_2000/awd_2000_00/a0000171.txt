The proposed research is a continuation of theoretical
              studies of the effects that plasma and neutral gas transport processes have on
              the Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere.  The research spans a 5-year period
              and will be conducted by a group that is composed of six scientists and a
              graduate student.  The research involves model/data comparisons, theoretical
              studies of ionosphere dynamics and electrodynamics, polar wind studies, and
              high-resolution thermosphere studies.  The overall approach is to consider the
              ionosphere as an integrated system, which interacts with both the magnetosphere
              and thermosphere.  The members of the group will study different, but related,
              ionospheric problems, with the result that almost all of the major ionospheric
              regions will be studied, including the E region, F region, and topside
              ionosphere at equatorial, middle, and high latitudes.  In the course of these
              studies, some of the group's models will be upgraded or improved, but most of
              the proposed studies will be conducted with existing ionospheric,
              thermospheric, electrodynamic, and polar wind models.  Also, in many of the
              proposed studies, data will be needed from several incoherent scatter radars,
              ionosondes, ground-based magnetometers, superDARN radars, and satellites, but
              all of the data required are either already available or will be available on
              the World Wide Web in the near future.  The proposed research is directly
              relevant to the National Space Weather Program as well as to the NSF-sponsored
              community-wide initiatives called CEDAR and GEM, and to NASA's TIMED
              satellite.
