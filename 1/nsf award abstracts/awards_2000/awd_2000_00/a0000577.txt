Abstract    :
              This proposal is a well-defined example of collaborative efforts between
              engineers and economists in the field of competitive electric power industry.
              This collaboration is essential for development of necessary understanding and
              computer tools for this industry. More specifically, the proposal deals with a
              development of a general framework that integrates game-theoretic aspects of
              power markets with the operational/physical constraint of electric power
              systems.
 
The object is to develop an analytical framework for studying the
              design, functioning and performance of alternative market mechanisms,
              considering the game theoretic aspects of those markets subject to the unique
              physical constraints of the system.  Simulation tools will be developed and
              utilized to "illustrate the performance of various market designs, rule
              specifications, regulatory policies, and strategic behavior of the various
              players.

A significant tradeoff is addressed, that between model complexity
              and study of multifarious solution strategies.  Unlike most economic studies,
              the former is preferred to the latter, as being more realistic and informative
              in the present context.
