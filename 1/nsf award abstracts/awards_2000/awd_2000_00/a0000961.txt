Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to investigate a cybernetic model-based
              approach to metabolic engineering.  This approach would address various ways in
              which the metabolic engineering goal may be compromised by regulatory phenomena
              in the overall pathway and to provide for the optimal design of genetic
              changes.  The 
formulation of the cybernetic model, based on experimental data
              with both wild type cells and selected genetic strains derived therefrom, is
              viewed to capture the regulatory features in the entire pathway.  Such a model
              forms the basis of examining the consequences of all possible genetic changes
              in the pathway. Also, the resulting model is suited for model-based optimal
              control of the bioreactor for maximizing product formation.  The model system
              is an E. coli strain that produces ethanol.  This collaborative GOALI project
              involves Purdue University, the University of Delaware, and the DuPont Chemical
              Company.
