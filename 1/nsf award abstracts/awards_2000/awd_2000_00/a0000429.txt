The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Yang Shao-Horn
              with 24 months support to work with Dr. Claude Delmas, Head of the Solid State
              Ionics Group at the Institute of Condensed Matter Chemistry (ICMCB) in
              Bordeaux, France. This project is co-funded by NSF's Directorate for
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities.
This project will study structural and electrochemical properties
              of layered lithium manganese derivatives having the O2 type oxygen stacking. 
              The aim is to determine and improve the electrochemical behavior of novel
              layered lithium manganese derivatives with the O2 type structure as the
              positive electrode in lithium rechargeable cells.
Dr. Delmas has extensive
              knowledge in intercalation chemistry of layered compounds.  ICMCB is one of the
              largest public research labs in the world involved in solid state chemistry and
              materials science.  It is supported by approximately 200 researchers and
              supporting staff, with state of the art facilities in solid state chemistry and
              materials science.
