Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to systematically investigate the cellular
              responses of Escherichia coli in regulating its metabolic activities upon
              precise genetic perturbations.  The synthesis of succinic acid will be used as
              a model system.  The role of two key cofactors, NADH/NAD+ and CoA, will be
              investigated.  In addition, 
the effect of enzyme properties on the
              redistribution of metabolic fluxes and on succinic acid productivity will also
              be investigated.  The specific objectives are to test the following hypotheses
              to increase flux through the succinic acid synthesis pathway: (1) reducing the
              effect of feedback inhibition of an enzyme which is involved in a key step of
              the product synthesis pathway; (2) if the product synthesis pathway requires
              the cofactor NADH, the overall flux through that particular pathway will be
              enhanced by manipulating the NADH/NAD+ pool; and (3) in situations where a
              cofactor has multiple roles, fine tuning of the co-factor level may be required
              for optimal product formation.
