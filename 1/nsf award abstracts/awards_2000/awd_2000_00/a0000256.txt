Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the large-scale structure of the magnetosheath
              using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models and data from the ISTP satellites. 
              Areas of study include the occurrence of the magnetospheric 'sash' predicted by
              MHD simulations, the depletion layer in the magnetopause, and disturbances
              produced by shocks in the magnetosheath.  Processes occurring at the
              magnetopause generate characteristic signatures that can be observed remotely
              from positions within the magnetosheath considerably removed from the
              magnetopause.  By identifying these magnetosheath signatures, the investigators
              will gain useful information concerning the occurrence patterns of magnetopause
              phenomena.  The award will support collaborative efforts with a professor at
              Istanbul Technical University.  The research results will support the goals of
              the National Space Weather Program and the Geospace Environment Modeling
              Program.
