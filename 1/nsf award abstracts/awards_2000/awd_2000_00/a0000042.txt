Abstract    :
              Support is provided to study the formation of eighteen-degree water (EDW) in the
              western North Atlantic, where the heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere is
              as large as or larger than the surface heat flux anywhere in the world. 
              Subduction, circulation around the gyre, and temporal variability of the EDW
              would be addressed using PALACE float data from the Atlantic Circulation and
              Climate Experiment (ACCE), XBT data collected from ships of opportunity, and a
              series of studies using the MICOM isopycnal coordinate numerical model. The
              combined analyses of the observations and model output will focus on the
              identification of the sites of EDW formation, the identification of EDW
              properties, the quantification of the amount of EDW formed for a given year as
              well as large scale circulation impacts of EDW formation and its relation to
              climate phenomena. This proposal is a contribution to the Analysis,
              Interpretation, Synthesis and Modeling phase of the World Ocean Circulation
              Experiment (WOCE).
