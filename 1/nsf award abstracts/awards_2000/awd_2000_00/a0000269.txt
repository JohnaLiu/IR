Partial travel support is requested
              for the participants at the Conference for Handling of Particulate Solids
              (Israel) to be held in conjunction with the Particle Technology Forum of the
              AIChE (US), Society of Powder Technology (Japan), European Particle Technology
              Party, Particle Technology Group of IChemE (UK) and International Freight
              Pipeline Society (US) meetings, at the Grand Nirvana, Israel, May 29 to June 2,
              2000.  This is an international meeting on particle science and technology,
              with focus on particle generation, processing and transport in gases or
              liquids.  The research has relevance to chemical, mechanical and civil
              engineers, materials scientists, physics, and metallurgy.  The Proceedings will
              be made available to the scientific community and industry.  The Conference
              will creates opportunities to develop interdisciplinary interactions with
              academic communities from other countries and with industry, as well as to
              evaluate recent research results in particle science and technology.
