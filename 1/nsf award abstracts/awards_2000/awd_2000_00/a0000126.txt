Abstract    :
              
 This proposal attempts to design an efficient power conditioning system for
              PV interconnection to a residence. The design is based on DC-DC converter and
              Inverter topology, and this topology itself is not a new scheme; it has been
              used in many cases of PV systems.  Also, the proposed scheme is designed to use
              the maximum power point (Voltage or current) derived from a MPPT algorithm
              (which assumed to be installed in a microcomputer based system).  Actually, the
              main reason that the MMPT is not well accepted in a small PV project is that
              the high-cost of the computer based maximum power tracker.  The PV market and
              application have yet to justify the adoption of MPT in terms of the benefit of
              just a little more power drawn from the PV cells against the initial costs of
              the MPT.   In a small size PV application, more economical power tracker is
              highly sought.  In addition, if the DC-DC converter is included in the proposed
              scheme, could the DC-DC control scheme, such as current control, accommodate
              the MPPT control?
