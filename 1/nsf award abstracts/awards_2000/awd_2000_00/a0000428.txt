The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. 
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              
research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for 
joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, 
expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.

This award will provide Dr. Barbara A.
              Ambrose with support for 
twenty-four months work with Dr. Elena
              Alvarez-Buylla Roces at 
UNAM's Instituto de Ecologia in Mexico City,
              Mexico.

The objective of this project is to examine the genetic basis of
              
an unusual floral pattern (carpels peripheral, stamens central) in
              
Lacandonia, and compare it with DNA-based phylogeny.  The origin 
of flowers
              is an important puzzle in the evolution of plants.  The 
project concerns a
              fundamental aspect of plant development using a 
model system that is only
              available in Mexico.  This project will 
make an important contribution to our
              understanding of flowering 
plant evolution.

Dr. Alvarez-Buylla's lab is
              fully equipped to develop all state-
of-the-art techniques in molecular
              biology and biochemistry of 
plants.  The host has extensive experience in
              phylogenetic  
analyses which will complement the PI's experience in molecular
              
biology techniques.
