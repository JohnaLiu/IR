Abstract    :
              This action is to continue support for operation of the Guerrero network,
              together with analysis of the data collected.

The Guerrero Accelerograph
              Network was installed in 1985 as a 30-station network of strong motion
              instruments along the coast of Mexico.  The purpose of the network is to
              recover accelerograms from an expected magnitude 8 earthquake in the Guerrero
              seismic gap.  While this major earthquake has not yet occurred, the network has
              obtained accelerograms from numerous small to moderate-sized earthquakes.  In
              the 15 years through the end of 1998, the network recorded 1768 high-quality
              digital accelerograms from 738 earthquakes with magnitudes less than 3 to
              8.1.

The Guerrero network is operated as a joint project of the Instituto de
              Ingenieria at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico
              City, and the University of Nevada at Reno.  Major support is provided by UNAM,
              which has upgraded most of the equipment from 12-bit to 19-bit digital
              recorders, as well as providing the major part of the field support, data
              playback, and data organization.

Data from the expected break on the
              Guerrero gap will have international significance.  In the United States, the
              data will provide estimates of ground motion in the Pacific Northwest due to a
              comparable earthquake expected on the Cascadia subduction zone; also for
              locations affected by the subduction zone in Alaska.
