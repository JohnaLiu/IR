This Americas Program award will support a planning visit to
              Ecuador by Drs. Peter Zeitler, David J. Anastasio, Anne S. Meltzer, and Frank
              J. Pazzaglia, all from Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa., to meet with Dr.
              Minard Hall and other colleagues from the Instituto Geofisico Nacional,
              associated with the Escuela Politecnica Nacional of Quito.  

The purpose of
              the visit is to carry out join research planning with scientists of the
              Instituto, to investigate field logistics, and examining key field sites, with
              the goal of developing two joint research projects, as well as a joint training
              program for advanced students of active tectonics and geologic hazards.  The
              projects include a study of the geodynamic mass balance in the northern Andes
              between volcanic eruptions and erosion;  study of neotectonic deformation and
              catastrophic sedimentation in the Interandean Valley; and a program that will
              involve research experience in these areas for advanced students.
