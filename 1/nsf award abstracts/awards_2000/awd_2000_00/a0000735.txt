Abstract    :
              This project addresses the Retrospective aspect of the U.S. GLOBEC Announcement
              of Opportunity.  The researchers will analyze acoustic and supporting
              hydrological and topographic data collected in summer 1995 and 1998 by the
              National Marine Fisheries Service with an eye to examining the spatial
              distribution of euphausiid patches and fish shoals as they relate to bottom
              topography, upwelling, current velocity, stratification and phytoplankton
              biomass.  Additionally, the researchers will participate in and analyze data
              collected in 2001 in the same area (Monterey, CA, to Queen Charlotte Islands,
              B.C., Canada).  

The researchers will examine a series of hypotheses
              concerning the possible association of large euphausiid patches near the shelf
              break north of Cape Blanco, Oregon, with minimum alongshore and
              onshore-offshore currents, large phytoplankton biomass and upwelling-driven
              currents directed towards the shelf break.  The scientists will also test
              hypotheses about the proximity of euphausiids with a major predator fish,
              Pacific whiting, and how it changes south to north of Cape Blanco, the possible
              enhancement of euphausiid density along the edges of submarine canyons, and the
              effect of El Nino on both euphausiid and whiting distribution and abundance. 
              The analyzed data will form a baseline data set for use by ongoing and proposed
              GLOBEC monitoring and process studies.
