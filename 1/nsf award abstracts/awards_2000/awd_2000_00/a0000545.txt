Abstract    :
              The objective of this award is to develop the capabilities, through strong
              linkages within the Earth System History community, dedicated computational
              facilities, and dedicated support staff, to enable an understanding of the full
              range and character of natural variability of the Earth's environmental system
              preserved in the geologic record, with the objective of contributing to a
              comprehensive theory of climate change. The project proposes case studies using
              numerical models of the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere, and biosphere, along
              with increased observations and model-data comparisons. The scientific
              questions associated with the past climate evolution of the earth will address
              three major topics: (1) the processes that are responsible for the first-order
              changes in climate that have occurred over the last 600 million years, (2) the
              processes that are responsible for fast or abrupt changes in past climate, and
              (3) improved assessment and evaluation of model predictions of climate change.
              The proposal hopes to establish a nation-wide integrative partnership in Earth
              system history modeling. This nation-wide integrative partnership in Earth
              system history modeling is designed to substantially increase the capabilities
              and opportunities in Earth system modeling by addressing the problems of
              limited computational resources, the lack of shared facilities designed to
              promote the needs of the entire community, and inadequate opportunities to
              extend the results of model studies and enhance their value across the full
              spectrum of Earth science disciplines.
