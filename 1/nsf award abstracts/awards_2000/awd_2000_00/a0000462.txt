The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will provide Dr. Darwin R. Reyes with support
              for twenty-four months to work with Dr. Andreas Manz at Imperial College of
              Science in London, England.
This project is co-funded by NSF's Directorate for
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities.


The goal of this research is to develop a separation system
              capable of multiplex protein analysis - `proteomic array analysis' - to analyze
              the levels of proteins in samples of genomic complexity.  It will involve the
              use of microfabricated channels (pseudo-gels) on polymers or quartz substrates
              for electrophoretic separations of proteins, first by isoelectric focusing and
              then 
by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis. Ultimately, the
              device will be employed to separate complex multiprotein biological
              samples.

Dr. Manz is one of the pioneers in microchip technology used for
              chemical applications.  He was involved in the development of high-speed
              analyzers based on capillary electrophoresis, liquid chromatography and flow
              injection analysis.
