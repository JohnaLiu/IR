Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative project whose principal objective is to develop an
              improved chronology of the southern (terrestrial) margin of the Scandinavian
              Ice Sheet (SIS) during the last glaciation in order to compare the history of
              this margin with that of the western margin of the SIS, with other ice sheets,
              and with other records of climate change in order to further evaluate the
              relationship between ice-margin fluctuations and climate change. The project
              will construct a chronology by dating (1) key organic-bearing units by AMS
              radiocarbon and (2) erratic boulders on moraine surfaces using cosmogenic
              nuclides (10Be and 26Al). Prominent recessional moraines delimit five to six
              retreat phases following the late Weichselian maximum at about 18,000 yr B.P.,
              clearly suggesting a strong millennial-scale signal (five to six moraine
              building events between 18,000 and 10,000 yr B.P). However, dating control
              constraining the age of retreat phases along the southern SIS margin is all but
              lacking. The project will investigate (i) the age of the nonglacial interval
              before advance of the southern SIS margin to its last glacial maximum position,
              (ii) the age that the southern margin reached its last glacial maximum, and
              (iii) the area(s) of recessional phases of the southern margin that are
              prominently recorded by recessional moraines. The project will focus on
              deposits and landforms of the SIS in Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania,
              Belarus, and Russia.
