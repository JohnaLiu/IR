This two-year award for U.S.-U.K. collaboration on lava-flow
              interactions with snow and ice involves Joseph Walder of Portland State
              University and the Cascades Volcano Observatory of the U.S. Geological Survey
              in Vancouver, Washington, and R. Stephen J. Sparks of the Centre for
              Environmental Geophysical Flows, University of Bristol.  The research
              collaboration is aimed at understanding flood generation and debris flows
              caused by the movement of lava over snow and glacier ice.  Several distinct
              sets of experiments are proposed.  Simulated lava flows will be released over
              ice and artificial snow, and the rate of meltwater production will be
              determined as a function of lava temperature, viscosity, discharge rate and
              ice-surface slope.  Simulated lava flows will also be released over ice blocks
              containing features that emulate glacial crevasses and a glacial meltwater
              drainage system.  Experimental results will be compared to theoretical models
              that then can be scaled to make predictions about real-world phenomena.

The
              U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in glaciology and the
              interaction of hot volcanic grain flows with snow.  This is complemented by the
              U.K. investigator's expertise in physical volcanology.  The Bristol Centre is
              the best facility in the world for experimental work on ice-lava interactions
              and has specialized equipment for simulating lava flows over ice.  The project
              will advance understanding of how flooding occurs and may be used to predict
              flooding caused by eruptive volcanic activity.
