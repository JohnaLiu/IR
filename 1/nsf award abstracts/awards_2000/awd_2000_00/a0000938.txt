Abstract    :
              In this proposal we consider a large class of discrete-state systems such as
              traffic networks, manufacturing systems, computer networks,
              distributed/parallel computing.  A livelock in such systems is a situation when
              some process is unable to finish because its clients perpetually create more
              work for it to do after they have been serviced.  This phenomenon is different
              from that of a deadlock where there is essentially no activity as each process
              is perpetually in a state of waiting, anticipating the release of resources
              that are held by other processes.  The issue of deadlock- and
              livelock-avoidance is particularly important to the synthesis of protocols,
              routing, cache/memory management, computer operating systems, manufacturing
              systems, traffic management, operations management of large organizations, etc.
               In this proposal, we present a collection of open-problems in the synthesis of
              supervisory control policies that guarantee liveness (i.e. absence of deadlock
              and livelock) in Petri net (PN) models of the discrete-state systems described
              above.   We also present some open-issues in the performance improvement of PN
              models that are deadlock- and livelock-free under supervision.
