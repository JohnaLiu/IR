The goal of
              this project is to further fundamental understanding of the growth and chemical
              activity of mixed metal oxides, which are important catalytic materials.  Model
              single crystal oxide surfaces will be used as supports, and supported oxide
              will be fabricated and studied using a number of surface science tools.  In
              particular, vanadia supported on titania and alumina single crystal surfaces at
              submonolayer to monolayer coverages will be studied.  Supported vanadia will be
              grown using chemical vapor deposition and immersion in aqueous solution.  The
              growth morphology and structure of the supported oxide will be studied by
              scanning tunneling microscopy.  The electronic structure will be studied by
              photoelectron and electron energy loss spectroscopy.  Related surface
              reactivity will be examined by both temperature programmed methods and by
              steady state reaction techniques.  Methanol oxidation and butene reduction will
              be used as test reactions. A large number of commercial heterogeneous catalysts
              are based on supported vanadia species, and this work has the potential to
              guide the preparation and development of vanadia and other supported oxide
              catalysts.
