Abstract    :
              The proposal deals with very important area of theory development and modeling
              for hybrid power systems, dynamic available transmission capability (capacity),
              use of General Minimal Residual method (GMRES) to speed up model computation,
              congestion reduction via real-time control using FACTS devices. Past work
              includes application of Trajectory Sensitivity Theory to parameter variations,
              initial conditions and machine (e.g. generator) sensitivity as well as locating
              vulnerabilities in a power network. 

This proposal addresses problems in
              security assessment within a restructured industry.  Such operation has shifted
              the focus of concern in dynamic security assessment to the assessment of
              available transmission capacity.  In order to handle this redefined problem,
              the proposal addresses (i) modeling of the system in greater detail, to
              incorporate power electronic devices for network flow control within a
              nonlinear hybrid model, and (ii) the use of trajectory sensitivity to evaluate
              contingent dynamic stability.  A particular strategy  proposed is to "use the
              results obtained in the iterative problem solver technique to solve both the
              state space and the sensitivity models," since "the Jacobean for both the
              models is the same while using the simultaneous implicit method.
