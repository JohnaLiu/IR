The Skidaway Institute of Oceanography will continue the
              scientific planning and management activities of the Coastal Ocean Processes
              (CoOP) research initiative by maintaining a CoOP planning office. The CoOP
              program seeks to promote interdisciplinary research in the coastal ocean.  Its
              goal is to obtain a new level of quantitative understanding of the transports,
              transformations and fates of biologically, chemically, and geologically
              important matter over the continental margins.  CoOP planning is being
              undertaken by a group of scientists dedicated to organizing large-scale efforts
              in interdisciplinary coastal ocean basic research. Through a series of
              workshops and the deliberations of a scientific planning committee, activities
              are undertaken to define the actual process studies and long-term measurements
              to be made. The office will communicate information about the CoOP program and
              the scientific results from CoOP projects by maintaining a CoOP web site and by
              regularly publishing a newsletter.
