Abstract    :
              This US-Brazil award provides support for cooperative research between Dr.
              Kenneth Mopper, Washington State University, and Dr. Armando A. H. Vieira of
              Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil on the production and fate of algal
              extracellular polysaccharides in a eutrophic reservoir near Sao Paulo,
              Brazil.

The PIs will work on an ecosystem in which large quantities of
              dissolved polysaccharides are produced by only a few species of cyanobacteria
              in a heavily  eutrophied reservoir. The main goals are to investigate the
              ecological functions and environmental implications of the microalgal
              extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) that are produced in great abundance in
              this reservoir.  

The results from these studies will be used as a basis for
              eutrophication management and water restoration programs both in Brazil and the
              U.S.  In addition, the PIs will train personnel and students in conventional
              and non-conventional limnological techniques.
