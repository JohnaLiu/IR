Abstract    :
              In this US-Argentina dissertation enhancement research award, Mr. Peter B.
              Adler, Colorado State University, under the sponsorship of Dr. William K.
              Lauenroth, will work with Dr. Osvaldo E. Sala at the Universidad de Buenos
              Aires in Argentina. The project is entitled "Effects of Grazing on Shrub-Steppe
              Ecosystems of North and South America."  This project will involve the
              comparison of the effects of livestock grazing on vegetation in the uniquely
              paired shrub-steppe ecosystems of North and South America, specifically the
              Great Basin and the Patagonian steppe of southern Argentina.  Field studies in
              each region, complemented by a greenhouse experiment will focus on vegetation
              and soil responses across gradients of grazing intensity and precipitation. 
              The PIs will evaluate the effect of grazing on above ground net primary
              production, community species composition, small-scale spatial heterogeneity,
              and soil carbon. 

The sagebrush-steppe of the Great Basin and the Patagonian
              steppe of southern Argentina have very similar climates and vegetation growth
              forms.  The results of these studies will test current theory in community
              ecology, providing useful information to natural resource managers in both
              regions.
