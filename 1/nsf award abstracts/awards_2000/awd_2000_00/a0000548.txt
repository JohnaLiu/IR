It is proposed to advance our understanding of the phenomenon of
              homogeneous nucleation , with an emphasis on better experimental purity of
              supersaturated solutions and also with the help of a detailed theoretical
              interpretation at the microscopic level.  Purity (i.e. the elimination of
              contaminants, to be found often in the neighborhood of the walls) will be
              achieved by employing the  "electromagnetic levitation trap" technique, which
              provide and isolate a large sample of droplets of nearly identical properties.
              The characteristics of the space-time interaction between solute clusters and
              the supersaturated solution will be measured reliably: such macroscopic
              properties as the induction times of the initial microdroplets will then enable
              the determination of the constants which quantify best the microscopic model.
              Special interest is centered on the stochastic nature of this model. The
              accuracy of this experimental input will rest on the construction of new
              devices, especially the "linear quadrupole electromagnetic levitator trap"
              which will produce an accurate time sequence of the nucleation process.
