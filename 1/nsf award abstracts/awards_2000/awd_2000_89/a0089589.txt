Abstract    :
              This is a US-Polish collaborative research project on non-local charges in
              supersymmetric integrable physics.  The principal investigator is Dr. Ashok Das
              from the University of Rochester.  His Polish collaborator is Professor
              Ziemowit Popowicz from the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University
              of Wroclaw.  

The researchers will combine their different areas of
              expertise to try to solve some of the outstanding problems in the area of
              integrable models.  In particular they will investigate the following three
              distinct but related problems in supersymmetric integrable systems:  non-local
              charges, miura transformation and bi-Hamiltonian structure.  Through this
              research they expect to provide further information on chemical and physical
              tuning in organic molecular solids. 

This project in theoretical physics
              research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts
              in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
