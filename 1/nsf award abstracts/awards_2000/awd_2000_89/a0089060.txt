Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55) 

We are developing an educational resource
              center focused around the area of optoelectronic microsystems by integrating
              technology into education. The purpose of this resource center is to attract
              undergraduate students into this newly emerging technology and to be a key
              component in providing a well-rounded education to students in this area. Our
              goal is to satisfy the need of the local and nationwide industry for
engineers
              knowledgeable in optoelectronics, microelectronics and the newly
              emerging
field of microsystems.

To this end we are developing eight
              multimedia educational modules and combining
them into a multimedia resource
              center for use in a technology-enhanced educational
learning environment. The
              development of the modules is guided by experience
gained from previous
              projects, where we identified both the content and form of
              effective
multimedia modules.

The modules are constructed using existing
              software packages and combine text, figures, audio and video with computer
              generated animation within an interactive environment with a professional look
              and feel. The individual modules are being field-tested by embedding them into
              our existing courses and curriculum, where they link the subject material
              across course boundaries and are improved based on the feedback received
              through the assessment process. We also testing and evaluating the modules at a
              remote site in a distance-learning environment. Finally, we will disseminate
              the resource center nationally through our website, the NSF Digital Library,
              mass mailing of CD-ROMs and a commercial publisher.
