Abstract    :
              This Collaborative Research Activities in Environmental Molecular Science
              (CRAEMS)  Award to the University of Kentucky is supported by the Special
              Projects Office in the Chemistry Division, and is in support of the work of
              Gerald Huffman and his collaborators in environmental chemistry.  Support is
              also provided to J. David Robinson at the University of Missouri-Columbia, and
              Ronald Pugmire and Adel Sarofim at the University of Utah through subawards.
              The research will focus on fine airborne particular matter (PM) of less than
              2.5 microns in diameter, derived from the combustion of fossil fuels in both
              stationary and mobile sources. These particulates are complex mixtures of
              ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, carbon, both elemental and organic, and
              inorganic constituents, particularly metals. The program will have three goals:
              (1) to identify molecular structure and microstructure, relevant for source
              apportionment; (2) to identify components that have significant effects on
              human health; and (3) to achieve, through laboratory experiments and modeling,
              a basic understanding of the formation mechanisms of critical structures
              identified. Molecular and microstructures will be characterized by a variety of
              spectroscopic and microscopic techniques including XAFS, GC-MS, 13C-NMR, SEM,
              TEM, XRF and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Samples will be obtained from large-scale
              combustion facilities and diesel truck sampling, laboratory experiments and
              ambient air sampling.

The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed new
              regulations for fine airborne particulates.  The knowledge generated by this
              research will be valuable for both the establishment of appropriate regulations
              for particulates and for compliance with those regulations.
