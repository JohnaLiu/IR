This award supports Mark Hallerberg and students from the
              University of Pittsburgh in a collaboration with Juergen van Hagen of the
              Center for European Integration Studies at the University of Bonn, Germany. 
              The research focus is on causes and consequences of fiscal crises that can
              occur at the local-government level, which poses a greater problem in an era of
              increasing decentralization.  The project will examine crises in the two
              traditional federal systems in the U.S. and Germany, and, in particular, the
              intergovernmental relations between the state and local levels.  The treatment
              of local fiscal crises in existing federal systems cans serve as models for
              other countries as the decentralize.  This joint collaborative research effort
              also presents junior researchers with the opportunity to work internationally,
              and the work done on this proposal will help institutionalize the relationship
              between the German and U.S. research groups.
