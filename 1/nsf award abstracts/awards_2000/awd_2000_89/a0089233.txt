Abstract    :
              Laboratory experiments on atmospherically relevant chemical reactions involving
              clusters will be performed. These clusters mimic conditions in/on liquid or
              solid aerosols (ice crystals). Since both neutral and ionic reactions can be
              studied, the role of acid catalyzed or ionic mechanisms will be studied. An
              example is the stratospherically relevant reaction of chlorine nitrate with
              water on ice crystals, the exact mechanism of which is still under debate.
              Other experiments will include studies of photochemical reactions on clusters,
              the unimolecular dissociation of small organic compounds on clusters, ammonia
              solvation, and reactions relevant to sea salt particles. This project is
              supported jointly by the Atmospheric Chemistry Program and the Experimental
              Physical Chemistry Program.
