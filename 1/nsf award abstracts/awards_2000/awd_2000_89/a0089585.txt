Abstract    :
              Over the past quarter-century, many studies have shown that the characteristics
              of tundra nitrogen cycles play a major role in controlling the response of
              tundra carbon cycles to climate change and disturbance. This research will
              determine how the characteristics of nitrogen cycling influence carbon
              accumulation and loss at 1- to 10-year time scales in an arctic Alaska
              watershed.  The PIs will (1) measure N inputs and outputs such as atmospheric
              deposition, fixation, and losses in streams, (2)  perform a 15N -labeling
              experiment to identify major N sinks, quantify their turnover rates, and trace
              downslope N fluxes, and (3) model C-N interactions, focusing on N limitation as
              a constraint on change in the C cycle.  The investigators intend to use the
              models that are developed to compare C-N interactions in arctic tundra with
              other ecosystem types.  The research is important because nitrogen is a key
              regulator of carbon cycling in most terrestrial ecosystems, including arctic
              tundras, but relatively little work on C-N interactions has been done at the
              watershed scale.  Understanding C-N interactions is key to understanding
              long-term responses of ecosystems to climate change.  Turnover and retention of
              nitrogen in watersheds are also key ecosystem services in a world where the
              annual nitrogen turnover rate has doubled globally due to human activity.
