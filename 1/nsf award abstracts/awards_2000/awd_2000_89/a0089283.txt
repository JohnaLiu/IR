Abstract    :
              Between fourth and eighth grade, American students' achievement and
              understandings of complex science decline relative to their peers
              internationally.  For urban students these declines are even more pronounced
              and, in many cities, standardized test scores remain among the nation's lowest.
               Through BioKIDS, late elementary students will embrace a coordinated
              curricular sequence that will support them as they grapple with complex science
              questions of their own design early, often, for multiple years, in multiple
              contexts and with the support of technologies tailored to their own needs and
              goals.

Student learning and beliefs in biodiversity and other topics will be
              tracked over multiple years to profile in-depth and sustained inquiry learning.
               Standards of evidence will be used to provide compelling examples of late
              elementary inquiry that can compliment high-stakes testing.  Hybrid
              technologies will serve as change agents for learning and will be embedded into
              many aspects of the learning activities.  Interdisciplinary teams will converge
              on effective means of representing complex science for inquiry activities at
              different ages.  Existing multi-year relationships with urban Detroit and
              schools nationally will serve as essential partners in the study of teacher
              support for innovation and scaling towards large impact.
