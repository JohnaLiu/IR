Abstract    :
              Through an interdisciplinary collaboration between a program that has achieved
              extensive validation of a theory of student learning and a program that has
              gained wide recognition for using Internet technology as a real-time resource
              in science classrooms. The triarchic theory of human intelligence will provide
              a systematic methodology for the study of student learning achievement levels
              of roughly 1600 middle school and high school students as they pursue lessons
              in the context of four different instructional conditions. The four conditions
              are: (1) traditional teaching using paper-and-pencil; (2) traditional teaching
              with (non-Internet ) computer use; (3) triarchically enhanced teaching using
              archived data but no computers; (4) triarchically enhanced teaching using
              real-time data via Internet. Each of the four conditions will be implemented in
              three different classroom settings: (1) the study of earthquakes and seismic
              phenomena by 7th and 8th grade students; (2) the study of air quality and
              pollution by 11th and 12th grade students; and (3) the study of velocity
              vectors used in navigation by 11th and 12th grade students. 

Strong emphasis
              will be placed upon recruiting teachers from urban schools, suburban and rural
              schools. Instructional conditions will be assigned randomly by school. Since
              Stevens Institute of Technology is pursuing teacher professional development
              programs involving more than 15,000 teachers in the states of Arizona, Florida,
              New Jersey and Ohio, recruiting schools in these four states will ensure
              diversity. The research will be conducted over a five-year period. Prior to
              Year 5, all teachers will be informed about interim research results concerning
              the efficacy of the triarchic approach, the use of real time Internet resources
              in instruction and the synergies between these two efforts to enhance learning.
