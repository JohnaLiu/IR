               Mathematical Sciences (21)

This project is producing a video-based, team
              oriented set of activities designed to provide skills for students taking their
              first college level mathematics course, thus enhancing their chances of
              succeeding in the course as well as improving their learning in the course. The
              basis for this project is that students must be actively involved in teaching
              themselves, and therefore require training to more effectively do so.

The
              "Excellence Through Mathematics Communication and Collaboration" project is
              providing such training. Students are assigned to "Focus Teams" of 4 students
              who are given a set of 10 projects to be completed outside of normal class time
              involving the soft skills of learning mathematics such as note-taking skills,
              homework techniques, test preparation skills, and other basic mathematical
              skills (i.e., organization, logic, notation, and the ability to communicate
              mathematics verbally.) Each project is a self-contained unit. Projects are
              being presented on videotape and include written instructions, team exercises,
              and reports to turn in. Students are held accountable for attendance and
              participation.

Outcomes from the project include (a) a set of 10 video-based
              projects along with written instructions, worksheets, and web components; (b) a
              guidebook with detailed instructions for faculty; (c) a pilot test of the
              project; (d) an evaluation/assessment plan for effectiveness of the project and
              a report of the results; and (e) dissemination of the project to the
              professional community.
