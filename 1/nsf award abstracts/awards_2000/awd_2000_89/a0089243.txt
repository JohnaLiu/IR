Abstract    :
              
This project will focus on the early learning of foundational skills and study
              how highly successful 4th and 5th grade teachers help students achieve above
              predicted rates, an o help close the achievement gap between highest and lowest
              performing students. We will ascertain if there is consistency among different
              indicators of teaching quality: nominations, classroom observations, and
              student learning gains, using multiple criteria (statistical significance,
              percentile distributions, and effect sizes) to select teachers on two different
              dimensions of high-quality teaching: academic excellence and equity. 

We
              will not presume that teachers who are unusually effective with their students
              "on-average" are the same ones who narrow the achievement gap without holding
              back high achievers. Nor will we presume that measures of "effectiveness" from
              student gain scores will correspond to measures of effectiveness that are
              embedded in observation instruments. Two researchers will observe teachers over
              one or two years using both standardized and open-ended protocols. Teachers and
              other school-based educators will be interviewed; key lessons in mathematics
              and reading will be videotaped. The planning grant will be used to refine the
              research design, questions and methodology; explore the feasibility of a
              comparative analysis; select the teacher sample through a database analysis;
              determine the final composition of the research team; collect, modify, and
              develop observation instruments; and establish a data management system.
