Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59) 

In this project, we are refining, expanding, and
              rigorously assessing an existing interactive, multi-media, self-paced
              computer-based learning prototype for introductory engineering thermodynamics.
              The prototype includes all topics in a typical introductory engineering
              thermodynamics course and incorporates several active learning techniques such
              as laboratory simulations, exposure to thermodynamic equipment, animation of
              concepts, instantaneous feedback, positive reinforcement, and others. In order
              to improve the instructors' understanding of student learning, we are adding
              electronic data gathering to the prototype. These data measure usage patterns
              (e.g., time on task, distribution of study time, and frequency of screen
              visits) and user performance (e.g., grades on internal mini-examinations,
              in-class examinations, and instructor evaluation of students). Student
              perceptions (e.g., questionnaires and student interviews) are also being
              assessed. These results are analyzed to refine and improve the existing
              prototype, and to identify those active learning techniques that work best in
              the computer-based-instruction (CBI) mode.
