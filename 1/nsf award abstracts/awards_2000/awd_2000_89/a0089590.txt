This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative
              research involves William E. Fitzgibbon of the University of Houston, Jeffrey
              J. Morgan of Texas A&M University, Pierre Fabrie of the University of Bordeaux
              I, and Michel Langlais of the University of Bordeaux II.  The project addresses
              mathematical analysis of systems of reaction diffusion equations that exhibit a
              high degree of spatial heterogeneity. The investigators propose to study
              systems  involving diffusive fluid transport and those which feature diffusion
              along concentration gradients.  Systems of this nature arise in a variety of
              situations in engineering, chemistry, biology, and physics, specifically, as
              realistic models for processes in epidemiology, environmental chemistry and
              biorestoration. The US researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in
              reaction-diffusion models and their generalizations. This is complemented by
              French expertise in mathematical biology and analytical and computational work
              in spatial heterogeneity. 

This award represents the US side of a joint
              proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research
              (CNRS).  NSF will cover the expenses of visits of members of the US research
              group and graduate students. The CNRS will support the visits of French
              researchers to the United States.
