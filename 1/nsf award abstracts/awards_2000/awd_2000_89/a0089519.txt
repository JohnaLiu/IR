Abstract    :
              0089519.  Daniel Hare

Individual plants within populations vary widely in
              their ability to resist attack by herbivores. Understanding this variation, and
              how different resistance traits evolve and coexist, is a major focus of
              contemporary ecology.  Because resistance traits are costly to maintain, the
              strength of selection for resistant and susceptible phenotypes can vary with
              herbivore intensity, and/or other forces such as environmental conditions or
              competitive interactions.  Furthermore, some resistance traits may be
              genetically linked with plant life-history traits that increase fitness,
              resulting in the conservation of resistance traits even when herbivores are
              absent. This empirical study will use field experiments to discern the indirect
              and direct costs and benefits of trichome polymorphism in Datura wrightii.  The
              study has three primary objectives.  Objective one and two will use greenhouse
              experiments to 1) evaluate the impact of herbivory on plants with and without
              the resistant traits, and 2) assess competitive interactions between plant
              phenotypes in the presence and absence of herbivores.  The third objective will
              use field observations to determine the extent of herbivory, the identity of
              herbivores, and their fitness consequences in natural Datura populations.  This
              work uses the Datura model, but the underlying principles are applicable for
              diverse insect-plant interactions and have relevance for both basic and applied
              science.
