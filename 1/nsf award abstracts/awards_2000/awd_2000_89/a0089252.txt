This is a one-year cooperative proposal between Dr.
              Nicholas Christie-Blick of Columbia University and Professor Sun Weiguo of
              Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, Chinese Academy of Science. 
              This project proposed to carry out a sampling trip to China to examine the
              stratigraphic and chemostratigraphic sequence of the Neoproterozoic Yangtze
              platform in South China.  The great thickness of carbonate strata makes the
              Neoproterozoic Yangtze platform a unique place for this research.  This project
              can provide the data to examine whether there is a strong relationship between
              negative excursions in carbon isotope and glaciations.   The Chinese Academy of
              Science and the NSF jointly support this project.
