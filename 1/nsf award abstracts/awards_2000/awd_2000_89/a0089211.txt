Linking ecosystem processes and community
              structure along salinity and nutrient gradients in tropical
              marshes

Accelerated land use change in the tropics is increasing nutrient
              loading to aquatic ecosystems. This is resulting in changes in species
              composition and ecosystem functions such as primary production and nutrient
              cycling. The aim of this research is to obtain a mechanistic explanation for an
              ecosystem level response to increased nutrient input along a salinity gradient.
               Dr. Rejmankova and colleagues propose that there is a context (salinity)
              dependent switch between phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) limitation in tropical
              marshlands. This project will use P-limited wetland ecosystems in Belize as a
              model system on which to document how nutrient limitation can be shifted along
              a salinity gradient through different constraints on individual components of
              plant communities. A short-term mesocosm experiment will evaluate response of
              individual marsh components to different levels of salinity, P and N.  A
              long-term experiment involving additions of nutrients to a replicated set of
              marshes of different salinity will verify the predictions of the
              ecosystem-level response. In addition to the intellectual merit of a better
              understanding of these ecosystems, the project has immediate relevance to
              conservation of wetlands, and may provide data that will be relevant to malaria
              control in Belize.
