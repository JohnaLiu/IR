Abstract    :
              
This project will plan a data collection center (DCC) to coordinate
              measurement instruments, facilitate research design planning and
              problem-solving, and coordinate the analysis of data from multiple projects
              within designated subject areas; it will also provide assistance in
              dissemination and utilization of research project results. We propose to focus
              upon: (a) designing a national data base (IERI Data Base), (b) designing an
              interactive portal to facilitate research collaboration (IERI Portal), and (c)
              designing an analytic workbench that performs selected data analyses (IERI
              Workbench). 

The project will consider a database that includes all IERI
              funded projects' proposed measures and student and teacher demographics; and
              guidelines for investigators to follow to compile their data for analysis and
              for reporting research results. The project is also considering an IERI Portal
              to provide IERI investigators, IERI program officers, and the scientific
              community with a collaborative environment for learning about ongoing and
              proposed research issues. The last consideration is an analytic workbench of
              software tools that specializes in (a) meta-analyses of intervention approaches
              and outcomes, (b) qualitative analyses of promising interventions and
              approaches, (c) selected secondary analyses of the planned national data base,
              and (d) identification and recommendation of future research directions.
