Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Argentina dissertation enhancement grant will support Esteban G.
              Jobbagy, under the direction of Dr. Robert B. Jackson of Duke University, to
              work with Professor Osvaldo E. Sala at the University of Buenos Aires.  The
              researchers will investigate plant controls on the vertical distribution of
              soil nutrients using grassland/forest ecosystems in South America that have
              been little impacted by anthropogenic inputs.  The research will address four
              specific hypotheses regarding the role of plants in mediating the accumulation
              and vertical distribution of belowground resources in terrestrial
              ecosystems.

The research has the potential to answer the question of how
              plants alter soil nutrient pools and their distribution.  This topic is
              important for terrestrial ecology and biogeochemistry and has relevance for
              plant community changes associated with altered patterns of land-use and other
              aspects of global change.  In a broader sense this work contributes to
              understanding how the soils of the world have developed under the separate
              influences of vegetation and climate.
