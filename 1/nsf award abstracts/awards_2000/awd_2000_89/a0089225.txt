Abstract    :
              
This investigation addresses the challenge of implementing effective
              instruction for reading comprehension in the elementary grades, based on a
              cognitive-motivational model of reading comprehension. From this framework, we
              developed Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI), which combines reading
              strategy instruction and inquiry science. The goals of the interdisciplinary
              team are to: (1) 'scale-up' CORI to the district level in the later elementary
              grades, (2) compare the effectiveness of CORI to strategy instruction (SI) and
              traditional reading instruction (TRI) for increasing reading comprehension,
              reading motivation, and science knowledge, (3) examine the variables
              influencing the scalability and sustainability of CORI, and (4) use technology
              for student learning, assessment, and teacher development. 

In a three-year
              longitudinal design, we are phasing-in CORI and comparison groups with a target
              sample of 3600 students across grades 3, 4 and 5 in 144 classes in 16 schools
              in one district. Effects of treatments are analyzed cross-sectionally and
              growth curve modeling is conducted longitudinally with Hierarchical Linear
              Modeling. Computer-based technology is used for: student learning (Internet web
              sites, computer tools, and CD-roms); student assessment (science knowledge);
              teacher professional development (preparation, collaboration, and monitoring);
              and dissemination.
