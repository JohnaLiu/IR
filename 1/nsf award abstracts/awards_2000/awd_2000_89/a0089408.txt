Abstract    :
              Physics (13) The problem-based learning (PBL) program initiated at the
              University for reforming undergraduate science teaching is being expanded
              beyond the University by the development of instructional models and materials
              made accessible to faculty worldwide through an online clearinghouse. The
              project is developing a database of problems, instructional models, evaluation
              tools, and web-based resources that effectively incorporate PBL across the
              content framework of introductory undergraduate physics courses. Materials are
              being collected and reviewed for a wide variety of introductory physics
              courses, for both science majors and non-science majors, across all levels of
              instruction and class enrollment. In addition to collecting existing problems
              and material, teh project is implementing problem-writing workshops as an
              important element in developing the collection of PBL materials needed to cover
              the different curricula of
physics at the college level. Selected
              clearinghouse problems will also be adapted to the high school setting.
