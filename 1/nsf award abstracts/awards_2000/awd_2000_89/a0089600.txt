Abstract    :
              0089600. Saros
Because of human intervention, the amount of atmospheric
              nitrogen deposited into alpine lakes has doubled in the last century.  This
              alteration in aquatic nutrient concentrations may have been accelerated by
              increased precipitation in these regions. This study investigates the effects
              of nitrogen deposition and climate change on the community composition of
              sedimentary diatoms in montane lakes of Colorado and Montana.  The interactions
              between anthropogenic nitrogen and precipitation are complex and their effects
              on diatom communities probably vary regionally.  This project will use in situ
              experiments and field surveys to test the hypothesis that changes in the ratios
              of nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus) have altered the structure of aquatic
              communities.  Furthermore, the research will integrate paleobiology of fossil
              diatoms and elemental analysis, to reconstruct the composition of ancient
              communities, and the resources available to them.  This study has potentially
              broad implications for understanding global change, and the mechanisms causing
              rapid shifts in the community structure of aquatic ecosystems.
