The proposed project develops and pilots an experimental
              module on knot theory for students in grades 3-5.  As part of the piloting
              process, a few teacher workshops are being provided to help pilot teachers
              understand the mathematics and learn how to use the module effectively.  The
              effects of the module would be assessed in terms of student use of
              visualization, spatial reasoning and geometric modeling to solve problems.  The
              module would be disseminated by placement on the web and through future
              workshops with teachers.
