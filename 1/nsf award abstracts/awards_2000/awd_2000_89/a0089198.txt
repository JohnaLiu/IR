Abstract    :
              This proposal will fund the planning of Modeling Across the Curriculum, a major
              program on the use of computer-based modeling on student learning and inquiry
              skills in secondary science.  The goal of the planning grant is to develop
              detailed partnerships, research design, and organizational and technical plans
              needed for a successful large-scale longitudinal study.

The Modeling Across
              the Curriculum project will conduct a longitudinal study of the impact of
              highly interactive modeling tools and associated learning materials on
              secondary level student science problem solving, reasoning, and performance on
              standardized tests.  The program, a large-scale collaboration integrating
              software and curriculum development, and significant data analysis tasks, will
              build on smaller-scale studies of the educational value of using, modifying,
              and building interactive computer-based models when supported with appropriate
              materials and teacher professional development.  In addition, it will afford a
              unique opportunity to combine prior developments into a coherent curriculum
              multi-year strand with a common format and set of tools.  A detailed analysis
              of the reliability, validity, and appropriateness of measures will be conducted
              in two urban partner schools and then will expand to include approximately 50
              districts nationwide.
