Abstract    :
              The chloroplastic carotenoid, zeaxanthin, has been identified as a blue light
              photoreceptor in guard cells.  This SGER award addresses the early events in
              the sensory transducing cascade that follows the photoexcitation of zeaxanthin,
              using a recently discovered blue-green reversibility of stomatal movements as a
              diagnostic probe.  Specific experiments include the characterization of
              zeaxanthin isomerization in a reconstituted pigment-protein system, using
              UV/VIS, Raman, and FTIR spectroscopy, and the study of possible conformational
              changes of zeaxanthin binding protein(s) in the antenna bed of the chloroplast.
               Other experiments will examine whether chloroplast movements in Arabidopsis
              leaves are also blue-green reversible.  All experiments demand the introduction
              of new techniques to central aspects of this research program.  Success in this
              research would dramatically enhance our understanding of the early events in
              the sensory transduction of blue light in guard cells.  The intrinsic high risk
              of the  experiments and the high impact that would ensue from success in their
              implementation, make this appropriate as a SGER.
