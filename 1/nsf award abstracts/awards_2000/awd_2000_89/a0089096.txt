This LTREB project will continue long-term studies on the
              ecology and evolutionary biology of malaria parasites of lizards. These studies
              take place at sites in California and the Caribbean. The systems have been
              under study for the past 9 to 22 years. Three interwoven studies will be
              pursued that all depend on the long-term data and blood samples obtained during
              the study. The first study will address parasite prevalence. Prevalence
              patterns at all four sites do not follow predictions emerging from standard
              epidemiological models for malaria. These differences are explained by the
              habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. The second study focuses on life-history
              traits. Infections in all four lizard species vary significantly in all their
              life history traits. In this case, two traits will be studied maximum
              parasitemia and first production of gametocytes. The clonal diversity and
              stress hypotheses will be tested with additional long-term data. Finally, the
              project will assess gametocyte sex ratio. The local mate competition hypothesis
              predicts that gametocyte sex ratios within infections will depend on the
              genetic diversity of those infections. Two mechanisms related to this
              hypothesis will be investigated. Together these three foci will expand our
              understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of host-parasite ecology.
              Results from this project have direct and important implications for
              understanding the natural history and ecology of emerging infectious diseases
              that affect animal populations, including humans.
