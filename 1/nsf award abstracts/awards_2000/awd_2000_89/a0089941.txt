Title: Understanding Female and Minority
              Retention and Success in the IT Workplace: Total Rewards and Social Networks
              Perspectives  

This CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal
              requests funds for a research program aimed at addressing fundamental issues
              underlying the effective utilization, retention, and upward mobility of women
              and minorities in the IT workplace.  The project takes a multidisciplinary
              approach to the design and implementation of three studies aimed at better
              understanding these issues.  The first study adopts a total rewards perspective
              in analyzing the IT workplace success and retention of women and minorities. 
              The second study uses social network analysis to study interaction patterns
              among members of an IT organization and their impact on women and minorities. 
              The third study longitudinally tracks students graduating from undergraduate
              programs in IT to learn more about how early perceptions and subsequent
              experiences influence career success and retention for women and minorities. 
              This project has the potential to provide valuable insights about the retention
              and advancement of women and underrepresented minorities in IT careers.
