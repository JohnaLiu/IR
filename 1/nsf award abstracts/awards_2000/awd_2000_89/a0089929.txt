Abstract    :
              A recently completed project (PHOBEA, Photochemical Ozone Budget of the Eastern
              North Pacific Atmosphere) will be extended in this work. The chemistry of the
              background North Pacific atmosphere will be investigated from the Cheeka Peak
              Observatory in Washington State, from a small aircraft, and at a newly
              established ground site at Mt. Ashland, Oregon. This work will focus on ozone,
              its precursors, and fine particles with the goal of understanding the sources
              for these compounds, and specifically what fraction of them may have been
              transported from Asia. A mesoscale model will be used to help determine the
              meteorological flow patterns during the observation period.
