Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21) 

The project implements an interactive learning
              strategy for students of lower level mathematics courses utilizing computer
              assisted instruction in five institutions of higher education, representing
              varied students and differing goals. The techniques have been used for several
              years with classes of elementary algebra students in the setting of a
              comprehensive university. These techniques encourage a mastery approach to
              education requiring the active participation of each student. Students practice
              problems with the help of tutorial assistance from both the computer and the
              instructor. The project is expected to improve the learning of lower level
              mathematics and in turn increase the success rates in these and subsequent
              courses dependent on mathematics. The immediate objective of this project is to
              modify the interactive modular teaching materials for a variety of settings and
              to validate the pedagogical advantages of this approach to the teaching of
              college algebra, pre-college algebra and finite mathematics. The more
              comprehensive goal is to use the results of this project to prepare for the
              national dissemination of these materials and thus contribute to raising the
              standard of mathematics literacy and problem solving nationwide.
