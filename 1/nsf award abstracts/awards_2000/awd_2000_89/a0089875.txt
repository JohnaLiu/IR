Electrophoretic deposition is the procress where charged colloid
              particles are driven by an applied
electrical field towards the surface of an
              electrode and deposited there. Under certain conditions, the particles will
              still be mobile and self assemble before being depositedat a fixed surface
              location. There is a variety of desirable applications for this procedure,
              depending on the colloids, the electrodes and also the applied electrical
              field; in particular, the results obtained differ radically for direct currents
              and for alternating ones. The goal of this proposal is first to assess the
              currentlyavailable theoretical models (e.g. electrohydrodynamic,
              electrokinetic) and their limitaions. It is then to develop a theory and
              perform experiments which would include all the aspects of self-ordered
              aggregation for the alternating current case (e.g. Brownian motion,
              electrokinetice, colloid forces).  Specifically, the expected to increase
              accuracy substantially above what has been obtained elsewhere with
              layer-averaged modeling.
