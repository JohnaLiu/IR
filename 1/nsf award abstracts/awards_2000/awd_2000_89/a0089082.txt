This pilot project studies how African women's
              health-seeking, reproductive and maternal strategies are changed due to
              migration to an urban context in the United States.  Fertility is quite highly
              valued in Ghanaian and Nigerian cultures, the primary origins for most of the
              women in the study, and is somewhat less important in the US.  Two cultural
              anthropologists will survey 600 immigrant households in Detroit, set up focus
              groups and select a sub-sample of women for in-depth interviews on how they
              negotiate their own health and reproductive needs, and those of their
              daughters, depending on their class status and social networks. The tension
              between values appropriate to the country-of-origin and values appropriate to
              the US will be studied as they affect cross-generation relationships.  The
              nature of the social networks available to women of different socio-economic
              and educational backgrounds is hypothesized to be a major factor in their
              access to resources.  The knowledge to be created by this project will be
              useful to help health professionals design programs to improve health and
              ameliorate problems of immigrant women.
