Abstract    :
              This CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to
              determine if an early intervention program promotes students' interest in
              pursuing a career in IT.  More specifically, this project will focus on the
              factors affecting students' decisions to enter the IT workforce in
              Mississippi's agricultural industry.  The target population will be students,
              especially underrepresented groups and females, enrolled in a new curriculum in
              Agriculture and Environmental Science and Technology (AEST). The schools using
              the AEST curriculum are primarily small, rural, comprehensive high schools and
              have an average of 45% minority student population.  AEST program schools will
              be matched with non-AEST schools with similar demographics.  This project has
              the potential to provide valuable insight about the impact of a culturally
              relevant intervention program on the interest of women and underrepresented
              groups in pursuing IT careers.
