Abstract    :
              
The American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) is
              developing a pilot project focused on improving undergraduate mathematics
              instruction for prospective elementary school teachers. The project design is
              based on the hypothesis that changing university teaching strategies is best
              accomplished when both faculty and the senior academic leadership of a
              university work together to develop and implement activities supporting
              comprehensive reform. The proposed project involves several key elements: the
              active leadership and involvement of the president and chief academic officer,
              including the participation of the chief academic officer on campus teams of
              faculty and administrators; individualized campus plans tailored to and
              responsive to the unique context of specific campuses; an initial week-long
              summer teaching seminar for teams of faculty and administrators from AASCU
              campuses in the summer of 2001, focusing on research-based best practices in
              teaching mathematics; a year-long implementation process on individual
              campuses; and a concluding two-day follow-up seminar the subsequent summer to
              discuss successes and challenges.
