This is a three year cooperative proposal between Dr. Chiu-Shui
              Chan of Iowa State University and Dr. Suchun Wan of Beijing Polytechnic
              University to develop an interactive visualization tool for city planners to
              manage urban growth and for designers to explore planning codes.  This project
              will involve six U.S. researchers, including five faculty members and one
              student of Iowa State University, and two Chinese scientists, one from the
              Beijing Polytechnic University and one from the Beijing City Planning and
              Administration Bureau.   

They plan to design a tool in virtual reality (VR)
              environments including a digital city and a set of planning regulations.  The
              user will be able to navigate through the city, select a property lot,
              determine planning issues, input data, visualize three-dimensional graphic
              guidelines, and animate surroundings to see the potential impact caused by the
              context. 

This project is unique, in that it will develop a tool that can
              support the inputs of new building designs, can use of the framework of local
              government building codes in the analysis, and can evaluate designs using
              aesthetic and functional bases.  The project presents a rare collection of
              expertise across both disciplinary and international boundaries.  The tool
              produced could become a part of the educational "toolkit" for urban design uses
              by architecture departments and colleges.  The results of this project could
              have substantial impact on teaching and training of future urban planners and
              architects, and could have significant societal benefit.  The Natural Science
              Foundation of China and the NSF jointly support this project.
