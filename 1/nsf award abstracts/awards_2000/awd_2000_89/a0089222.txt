Abstract    :
              
This project will focus on identifying, quantifying, and describing teaching
              strategies that result in high elementary student performance in reading and
              high elementary student performance in science. In today's environment of high
              stakes tests and increased accountability, elementary teachers are under
              pressure to devote increasing amounts of classroom time to reading and
              mathematics. Research on the relationship between reading and inquiry science
              may provide teachers with strategies for improving both the teaching of science
              and reading and for including science as a core subject. 

The long-term
              project will critically analyze teachers who are currently demonstrating
              success or failure in both reading and science (by measures such as
              standardized tests accepted by the state) and carefully document classroom
              practice and pedagogical strategies. Successful instructional approaches and
              common themes and patterns will be tied to a general theory of effective
              instruction. The project will have as partners two or three states that
              administer state-wide standardized tests in both language arts and science and
              have other supporting elements of systemic reform in place (e.g., standards and
              supporting policies).
