Abstract    :
              
This planning grant is designed to serve as the foundation for a full-scale
              proposal to the IERI.  During planning grant the project will run a pilot study
              which begins to integrate the existing activities in order to collect
              preliminary data on barriers to vertical integration, and will work with a
              second geographical location as a site for studying the replication of the
              vertical integration model system.

The major goal of the long term research
              project is to identify the institutional and social arrangements necessary for
              the successful vertical integration of proven after-school educational K-12
              programs.  Currently, these programs operate independently at the pre-school,
              elementary school, middle and high school levels.  Our goal is to bring
              together an interdisciplinary team to design a vertically integrated system of
              such activities and to develop a set of methodological tools which will be
              useful for studying and integrating after-school programs more generally.  This
              vertical integration will constitute an effective pipeline for educational
              achievement in SMET.  Such integration is necessary for the development of
              individual students, for the mutual support of after-school and school
              activities, and for sustaining these design efforts.
