This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              marine environment involves Susan E. Ford and Eric N. Powell of Rutgers
              University's Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory, researchers at the Center
              for Coastal Physical Oceanography at Old Dominion University, and Christine
              Paillard and her group at the Institut Europeen Universitaire de la Mer.  The
              objectives of their project are (1) to construct a numerical model of a marine
              disease and (2) to test the modeling techniques developed for protozoan
              parasites on diseases caused by bacteria, such as Brown Ring Disease of marine
              clams.  The US and French investigators bring to this collaboration
              complementary expertise in ecology and numerical modeling.  The project also
              takes advantage of a long-term database, developed by the French, on Brown Ring
              Disease of marine clams, which will be integrated into a new model. 

This
              award represents the US side of a joint proposal to NSF and the French National
              Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living
              expenses for the US investigators.  The CNRS will support the visits of French
              researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental
              understanding of complex interactions among host, parasite and environment. 
              More broadly, it will contribute to understanding the role of short and
              long-term climate variations on the fluctuation of disease of marine molluscs. 
              Results could be valuable to environmental regulators in both countries.
