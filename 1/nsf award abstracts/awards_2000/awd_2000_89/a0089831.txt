This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              chemistry involves Robert R. Lucchese at Texas A&M University, Danielle Dowek
              and Georges Raseev at the Universite de Paris/Sud in Orsay, France.  Their
              collaboration addresses theoretical and experimental studies of the
              photoionization process and development of a methodology for comparison and for
              application to small molecular systems.  Photoelectron angular distributions in
              photoionization is the project's principal focus. The US investigator brings to
              this collaboration theoretical expertise in molecular photoionization
              processes.  This is complemented by the French group's experimental expertise
              on photoionization and experience computing molecular frame photoelectron
              angular distributions.  The project also provides access to a specialized
              synchrotron light source in Orsay.

This award represents the US side of a
              joint proposal to NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research
              (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US
              investigator and graduate students.  The CNRS will support the visits of French
              researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance understanding
              of fundamental processes in photoionization. Studies of photoionization probe
              the nature of highly excited states of molecules. These states have
              applications to many fields from astrophysics and atmospheric chemistry to
              biology and materials processing.
