Abstract    :
              This project will lay the groundwork for a methodologically rigorous five-year
              study that on ways to improve the use of telecommunications in the teaching of
              high school.  During this phase, the project will look at variables that
              enhance the effectiveness of telecommunication technologies in teaching and
              learning science. The project will also identify or plan a psychometrically
              sound measure of student learning achievement in accordance with 2061tms
              science standards.  On that basis, the project will design one or more
              appropriate professional development interventions and an experimental design
              on to determine their effectiveness in enhancing student achievement in
              science. 

Teachers, by and large, are unprepared to create effective
              technology-rich learning environments. The five-year study will focus on how
              professional development and other interventions help teachers improve their
              ability to evaluate and integrate telecommunication tools and related
              curriculum and instructional materials into effective science instruction in
              secondary science. Student achievement will be measured against national
              science education standards (American Association for the Advancement of
              Science 1993; National Research Council 1996). schools.
