Title:  Women and Information Systems: Modeling the Impact of
              Work Values, Attitudes, and Attributes on Career Choices

This CISE
              Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to assess
              whether women are more attracted to careers in Information Systems (IS) because
              of the perception that it is more people-oriented than other computer-related
              fields.  Both men and women undergraduate students will be surveyed as to their
              work values, beliefs, and attitudes related to IS, and job preferences in order
              to test a model of the underlying factors driving gender differences with
              respect to career choices.  This project has the potential to provide
              significant insights about factors affecting the recruitment and retention of
              women in IT majors
