This award supports Ronald Hanson and students from Stanford
              University in a collaboration with Juergen Wolfrum of the Department Physical
              Chemistry at the University of Heidelberg, Germany.  The research funded by
              this award will focus on developing laser-based diagnostic measurements during
              high-pressure combustion.  One area to be addressed is the need for
              quantitative laser-induced fluorescence measurements of nitric oxide at high
              pressures where pressure broadening of the spectral lines produces interference
              from whatever molecular oxygen is present.  This problem will make use of the
              German group's expertise in high-pressure burners and a new experimental
              facility at Stanford.  A second problem to be worked on is the characterization
              of molecular fuel tracers for fuel/air mixing to systems under high pressure. 
              Each research group will use molecular tracers with different chemical
              structures, and the collaboration will allow direct comparison or the two
              different approaches.  The opportunity this joint, collaborative research
              effort presents junior researchers is substantial, and the work done on this
              proposal will help institutionalize the relationship between the German and
              U.S. research groups.
