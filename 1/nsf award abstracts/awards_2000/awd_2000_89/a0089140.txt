This U.S.-Slovak research project between Mark
              Meisel at the University of Florida, Gainesville, and his partner Alexander
              Feher of P.J. Safarik University, Kosice, features an investigation of the
              thermodynamic and magnetic properties of a variety of novel low-dimensional
              inorganic magnets. Know and new materials, including powders and crystals of a
              variety of compounds constituting model spin chain and ladder systems, will be
              characterized by combining a blend of macroscopic and microscopic probes that
              span a range of temperature, magnetic field and pressure.  Subject materials
              include: spin ladders, alternating spin chains, alternating exchange chains,
              single-ion bound states, and low-dimensional ising dipolar systems.  Results
              are expected to improve our basic understanding of the properties of several
              low-dimensional magnetic systems and, potentially, the pairing mechanisms in
              exotic superconductors.

This condensed matter physics project fulfills the
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the
              United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
