The objective of the proposed research is to replace the
              patch-clamp pipette with an aperture on a microchip and to replace the carbon
              fiber with electrochemical electrodes fabricated on microdevices.  The specific
              objectives are to: (1) record the current through the cell membrane using
              microchip technology, (2) measure secretion from individual cells with high
              time resolution using electrochemical electrodes constructed on a microchip,
              and (3) automatically target individual cells to electrophysiological probes on
              the microchip.  This award is co-funded by the Division of Engineering
              Education and Centers, the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems, and the
              Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems.
