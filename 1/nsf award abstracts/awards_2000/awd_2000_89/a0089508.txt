This award supports Andrew Whittle and students from the
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a collaboration with Stavros Savidis
              of the Department of Civil Engineering at the Technical University of Berlin,
              Germany.  The research focus is on new methods of analysis for predicting
              ground movements caused by excavations.  The MIT group has extensive experience
              in analyzing clay soils of the type present in the Boston area, whereas the
              German group has expertise modeling sandy soils common in the vicinity of
              Berlin.  Together, the two groups will have the unique opportunity of comparing
              developments in constitutive modeling and laboratory characterization of
              different soil types in order to refine and enhance current models.  The
              results of this research will lead to improved tools for mitigating damage to
              adjacent structures and utilities caused during excavation phases of large
              building and transportation projects.   This joint collaborative research
              effort also presents junior researchers with the opportunity to work
              internationally, and the work done on this proposal will help institutionalize
              the relationship between the German and U.S. research groups.
