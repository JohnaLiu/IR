Abstract    :
              This planning grant will enable the transition to larger-scale, more rigorous
              testing of a technology and curriculum project (SimCalc) whose aim is to make
              generally available the mathematics of change and variation by incorporating
              dynamic, computer-based representational tools into the classroom experience of
              middle-school children. 

SimCalc's aim is to make mathematical concepts such
              as "rate" become available to students without an algebra prerequisite, and
              push the boundaries of what K-12 learners can master. SimCalc was developed and
              tested in variety of settings including some of the lowest performing districts
              in two states, and one class in which English was a first language for only 35%
              of the students. The collaborations in the planning process will help design
              rigorous experiment that will analyze how to produce the desired effects with
              diverse students in varied educational settings and with teachers who vary in
              their sophistication about and comfort with technology. Findings from the
              long-term research could influence an understanding of what "high expectations"
              are possible to achieve for all students, and the role of technology,
              curriculum, and teacher support in reaching those expectations.
