Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

This project creates new educational material for
              the instructor that uses a formulation of math reform that is textbook and
              curriculum independent. The goal is to prepare students for the 21st century
              technological workplace by creating a potent and attractive integrated learning
              environment in mathematics by stressing the descriptive, numerical, graphical,
              and symbolic delivery of mathematical concepts. This project researches, tests,
              refines, and disseminates a formulation of mathematics reform that is textbook
              and curriculum independent. The project focuses on exponential and logarithmic
              functions, materials that are found in both a precalculus and a calculus
              course. The developed resource materials allow dissemination of reform to occur
              naturally, which can help alleviate the departmental calculus textbook
              debates.
