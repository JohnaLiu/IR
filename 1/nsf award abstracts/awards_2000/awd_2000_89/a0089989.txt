Abstract    :
              This CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to
              examine the effects of pair-programming on female students' perceived
              self-confidence and interest in computer science as well as their retention and
              achievement in these courses.  Approximately, 400 students enrolled in
              introductory computer science courses will complete a series of programming
              assignments in pairs (same and mixed gender pairs) or independently.  It is
              hypothesized that women who program in pairs will produce better programs in
              terms of functionality and readability, report greater confidence in their
              solutions, enjoy programming more, and have higher retention rates in computer
              science and related areas than women who program independently.  This project
              has the potential to provide valuable insights into the retention of women in
              computer science.
