This is a CAREER award that supports research on strongly
              correlated electron systems and quantum magnetism with a computational thrust. 
              The following problems will be attacked: (1) excitation spectra of complex spin
              liquids, such as the spin-orbital chain and multi-leg Heisenberg ladder, (2)
              the effect of doping two-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional quantum spin
              liquids with static vacancies and mobile holes, and (3) spatial patterns of
              bound states in anisotropic superconductors.  Dynamical DMRG, stochastic series
              expansion quantum Monte Carlo, and exact diagonalization methods will be used
              to carry out most of the work.  The education component involves an outreach
              and support program for Los Angeles high school science teachers which
              includes: (1) a monthly colloquium, (2) training seminars and labs in the
              summer, and (3) regular faculty visits to the schools.  The objective is to
              improve the quality of high school education in the inner cities.

This is
              a CAREER award that supports theoretical and computational research in
              low-dimensional materials with exotic magnetic properties. These materials are
              related to the high temperature superconductors and are important in the
              understanding of quantum magnets and materials with competing ordered ground.
              The award supports an ambitious educational activity that leverages existing
              infrastructure with the aim of improving the quality of high school education
              in the inner cities.  The program aims to provide a "home base" for high school
              science teachers and to help improve the science qualifications of teachers,
              the connections between high schools and institutions for higher-education, and
              working conditions.
