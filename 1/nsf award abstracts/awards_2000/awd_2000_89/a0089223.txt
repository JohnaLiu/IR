Abstract    :
              the purpose of this proposal is to support the activities of the Board on
              Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment (BICE) of the National Research
              Council, National Academies.  The request is for $55,000 out of a total of
              $185,000 for the one-year period from 1 October 2000 through September 30,
              2001.  BICE proposes to continue its function of providing an independent forum
              where expertise from a wide variety of scienfific and engineering disciplines
              can address issues and opportunities concerned with infrastructure and the
              built environment.  BICE has and will continue to respond to specific requests
              from government, and, as appropriate, act on its own initiative with public and
              private support.  During the coming year, BICE will broaden its activities in
              natural and technological hazards to incorporate "extreme events" events whose
              impacts, effects or outcomes are significant, in this context, to the
              infrastructure and the built environment.  A colloquium on the topic is planned
              during the period of the grant.
