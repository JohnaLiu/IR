	Dr. Jennifer Wernegreen of the Marine Biological
              Laboratory at Woods Hole, MA, has been awarded a grant to study unique features
              of the genomes of bacteria that live permanently in the tissues of certain
              insects.  Bacterial species show a wide variation in rates and patterns of DNA
              sequence evolution in their genomes, but few comparative studies have explored
              the mechanisms that produce this variation. Distinct patterns of molecular
              evolution may result from mechanisms related to changes in habitat, genes
              present in the genome, and/or other natural genetic processes.  The objective
              of this project is to distinguish how these different mechanisms contribute to
              how and why genomes evolve in the ways that they do.
	This project focuses on
              Candidatus, a bacterial symbiont of carpenter ants, and Buchnera, a bacterial
              symbiont of aphids, as model systems to explore the molecular evolutionary
              consequences of this unusual lifestyle.  These obligate bacterial symbionts are
              closely related to free-living bacterial species such as Escherichia coli. 
              Wernegreen's lab group will sequence several protein coding genes from
              multiple, diverse lineages of Candidatus, Buchnera, and E. coli to compare
              patterns of molecular evolution in each group. This will permit them to test
              for different phenomena that might be responsible for evolutionary changes in
              the genomes of Candidatus and Buchnera.  Analyses will include contrasting the
              symbionts and E. coli with regard to rates and patterns of protein and DNA
              sequence evolution.  The results of this project will provide a framework to
              understand the vast diversity of evolutionary rates, compositions and
              architectures of bacterial genomes.
