Turner
This award supports Joseph Turner and students from the
              University of Nebraska-Lincoln in a collaboration with Walter Arnold of the
              Fraunhofer Institute for Nondestructive Testing in Saarbruecken, Germany.  The
              project will focus on the relation between ultrasonic absorption and scattering
              and fatigue damage.  Two new techniques will be investigated, one developed by
              Arnold, and the other by Turner, will be used to analyze identical specimens. 
              The collaboration will make possible an exchange of techniques which make use
              of the complementary expertise available from the German and U.S. groups,
              thereby leading to new techniques for measuring and monitoring fatigue damage
              of structural components used in building and manufacturing.  Exchange of
              junior researchers is emphasized to add an international dimension to their
              training and to allow them to establish international connections early in
              their careers.
