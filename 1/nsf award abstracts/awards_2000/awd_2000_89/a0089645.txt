This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              earth sciences involves Rodney C. Ewing at the University of Michigan and
              Georges Calas and Thierry Allard of the Universite de Paris VI and VII.  The
              project addresses long-term radiation effects in minerals and materials. They
              will study several research problems: the effects of radiation damage on
              chemical reactivity and surface reactivity of minerals; and radiation effects
              on the structure and chemical reactivity of sheet silicates, including clays
              that can be used as "geologic dosimeters."  They will also continue radiation
              studies of zircon, an important mineral with potential use for disposing
              plutonium.   The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
              studies of radiation damage in minerals, mostly through X-ray diffraction and
              transmission electron microscopy.  This is complemented by French capabilities
              in spectroscopic studies used to characterize radiation defects at the
              atomistic level. 

This award represents the US side of a joint proposal to
              NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will
              cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator.  The CNRS will
              support the visits of French researchers to the United States. The
              collaboration will advance understanding of radiation effects in complex
              ceramics and materials.  The research has practical importance and may
              contribute to better methods for storage of nuclear and radioactive waste
              materials.
