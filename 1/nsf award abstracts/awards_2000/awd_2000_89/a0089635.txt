RUI: Effect of climate change on carbon cycling
              within the discontinuous permafrost zone of Canada

Over most of the Earth's
              land surface, the quantity of carbon sequestered in soil organic matter is
              greater by a factor of two or three than the amount stored in living
              vegetation. The quantity of organic matter in soil plays a critical role in the
              earth's geochemical carbon cycle. High-latitude peatlands represent only about
              11% of the global land surface area, yet contain an estimated 25 to 30% of the
              world's total soil carbon pool. Much of this carbon is stored in the frozen
              peat soils within the permafrost layer. The goal of this research is to
              determine the effect of a changing climate on carbon cycling in Alberta,
              Canada. Recent evidence indicates that permafrost is degrading in response to
              elevated temperatures and changing moisture input. As the permafrost melts, the
              peat surface subsides to the level of the water table and becomes saturated.
              Early results suggest that these melt areas produce 100-200x greater methane
              emission than the nearby unmelted bog. Dr. Whiting and students and
              collaborators plan to study these melt features to determine the origin of the
              carbon in the methane (ancient vs. new) and to find out if the age of the melt
              feature affects methane emissions.
