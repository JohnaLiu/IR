Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to undertake the first book length study of the
              ethical and moral dimensions of restoration ecology, the science and
              technological practice of restoring damaged ecosystems.  Following a detailed
              study focusing on the value of public participation in such restorations, the
              objectives of the project are to (1) articulate the moral foundations of
              restoration practices in opposition to philosophical objections concerning the
              conceptual foundations of restoration, (2) investigate the relationship between
              the moral foundations of restoration and the scientific questions involved in
              restoration such as the necessity of eliminating exotic species to make room
              for the restoration of native ecosystems, (3) ascertain whether establishment
              of the moral foundations of restoration assists in resolving ethical quandaries
              which have arisen over the science and technology involved in restoration, (4)
              determine whether ethical arguments exist for maintaining, where possible,
              public participation in restoration activities, and (5) question whether
              findings from objectives 1-4 should impact the way practitioners are trained to
              do restorations.  In addition to undertaking a complete survey of work on (1)
              the role of public participation in environmental decision making in general
              and (2) the moral foundations of restoration ecology, both in the philosophical
              literature and in the scientific and social scientific literatures, completion
              of the project will also involve several site visits to restorations in
              Chicago, New York City, and several other locations involving substantial
              restoration activity, such as Madison, Wisconsin.  The role of the site visits
              will be to test my philosophical intuitions on the benefits and hazards of
              public participation in restoration projects.  As this will be the first book
              length treatment of the potentially positive values of restoration, the
              potential impact of this project is significant for (1) advancing understanding
              of the complexity of restoration as a scientific and technological practice
              beyond the current state of knowledge in the field and (2) creating a framework
              through which future work on the human resource elements of restoration can be
              understood.  Restoration ecology is arguably one of the most important
              environmental practices currently engaged in toward the goal of achieving
              long-term environmental sustainability.  This project will restore an absent
              moral dimension to discussions of this practice.
