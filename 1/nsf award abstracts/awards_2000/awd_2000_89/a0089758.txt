This award supports Keith Hohn and students from Kansas State
              University in a collaboration with Olaf Deutschmann of the Physics Department
              at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. The research funded by this award
              will involve detailed modeling of the partial oxidation of methane at
              millisecond contact times.  Modeling of high flow-rate conditions will lead to
              better understanding of the complex interaction of gas and surface chemistries
              and of mass, heat, and momentum transport, and thereby to a better
              understanding of short contact-time reactors.  The U.S. group will obtain
              experimental data suitable for modeling at high flow rates, while the German
              group will perform simulations with newly modified computer codes.  The
              opportunity this joint, collaborative research effort presents junior
              researchers is substantial, and the work done on this proposal will help
              institutionalize the relationship between the German and U.S. research
              groups.
