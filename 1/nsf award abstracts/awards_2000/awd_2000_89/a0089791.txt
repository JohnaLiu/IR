This three-year award for US-France cooperative research
              involves Bronwyn Hall of the University of California at Berkeley and the
              National Bureau of Economic Research, Paul David of Stanford University,
              Jacques Mairesse of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, and
              Dominique Foray of the Universite Paris-Dauphine.  They will conduct
              comparative US-France studies of resource allocation in scientific institutions
              and impact on research productivity. The objective is to test a simulation
              model and understand its econometric properties, using data from the French
              National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the National Science
              Foundation (NSF).  These two organizations use different resource allocation
              systems to support research and scientific institutions. In addition to this
              project, the investigators will continue their studies on the econometrics of
              investment and the heterogeneity of behavior of US and French manufacturing
              firms.  The US and French investigators have complementary expertise.  Hall and
              Mairesse will focus on the econometrics of investments; and all four
              investigators will work on the comparative studies of resource allocation and
              productivity of scientific institutions.

This award represents the US side
              of a joint proposal to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will cover travel funds and
              living expenses for the US investigators and graduate students.  CNRS will
              support the visits of the French researchers to the United States.
