Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) 
The Electronic Biochemistry e-book is a fully
              interactive, digital resource that transcends the limitations of the
              two-dimensional printed page and demonstrates the natural richness of the
              biochemical world in the three dimensions of space and the fourth of time.
              Through this project, interactive learning modules are being developed and
              tested and learning environments are being created that prompt students'
              attention. The e-book utilizes three software technologies including Chime, a
              molecular modeling plugin; Java, an object-oriented programming language; and
              Flash, software that creates animations in the HTML environment using streaming
              vector graphics. The e-book is compatible with PC and Apple Macintosh
              computers. The investigators are also developing, in partnership with
              publishers, software developers and industry liaisons, a standard computing
              tablet/e-book reader platform of sufficient power and features to facilitate
              better e-book delivery for this and other textbooks. The Electronic
              Biochemistry e-book is not the result of a simple transfer of text and figures
              from a paper textbook to an electronic format, with the addition of molecular
              modeling, Java applets, and animations. Rather, it is a rich and extensive
              biochemistry "sandbox", in which students can play, learn, imagine,
              problem-solve, and create, with few limits.
