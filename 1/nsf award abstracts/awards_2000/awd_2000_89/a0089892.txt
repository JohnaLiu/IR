Digital Government: SGER:
              Citizen Agenda-Setting in the Regulatory Process: Electronic Collection and
              Synthesis of Public Commentary

This planning grant will support initial
              examination of the impact of new communications technologies, such as the
              Internet, on public involvement in the regulatory rule-making process, leading
              to more sophisticated and manageable information systems for citizen/government
              interaction.  A related topic of interest is to explore the degree to which
              electronic avenues make public comment more difficult or less effective for the
              citizen.  The partner agency is the National Organic Program (NOP) of the U.S.
              Department of Agriculture.  As the project progresses, it will promote further
              collaboration between social scientists, federal agencies, and information
              scientists.  Recently, the NOP received over 275,000 comments via email, fax
              and postal mail in response to a proposed regulation.  It is difficult to draw
              conclusions from such a large and heterogeneous set of responses without the
              assistance of information technologies.  NOP has provided the PI a sample data
              set of 20,000 responses to begin this project.
