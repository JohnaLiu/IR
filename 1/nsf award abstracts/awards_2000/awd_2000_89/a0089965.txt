This CISE
              Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to investigate
              the attraction, retention, and promotion issues of women in IT by comparing
              female and male professionals who hold degrees in Computer Science/Computer
              Engineering (CS/CE) and who work in software and Internet companies.  A major
              component of this investigation will be a survey of male and female CS/CE
              degree holders from 800 Massachusetts software/Internet workplaces.  A second
              major component will be qualitative interviews with a sample of 100 female and
              100 male IT professionals drawn from the survey respondent pool.  This project
              has the potential to provide significant insights about factors affecting the
              recruitment, retention, and promotion of women who pursue IT careers.
