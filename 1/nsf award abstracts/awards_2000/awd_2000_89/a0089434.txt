Abstract    :
              Geography (88)
This is a 5-year project of workshops and seminars supporting a
              long-term, broad-based improvement in the learning and teaching of geography in
              higher education. This is being accomplished by providing junior faculty and
              advanced doctoral students with the theoretical and practical knowledge needed
              to excel in the lecture hall, seminar room, and laboratory. Participants are
              learning methods of active pedagogy, inquiry-based learning, teaching with
              technology, and topics often overlooked in today's graduate curriculum --
              course planning, student assessment, discussion leadership, lecturing skills,
              field study, and evaluation methodologies. Key objectives of the project are to
              foster a culture of support and success for young faculty, to help them
              understand the fundamental interconnections between their teaching and
              research, and to advance the scholarship of teaching and learning across the
              entire discipline. To this end, the workshops are being led by some of
              geography's most accomplished scientists, scholars and teachers. These senior
              scientists, who also comprise the project's advisory board, are also assisting
              in establishing a mentoring network for participants in the project.
To reach
              these goals, two workshops of one week duration are being held each summer for
              five years (2002-2006), with each workshop enrolling twenty participants. In
              addition, follow-up seminars, panel discussions, and paper sessions are being
              scheduled at the annual meetings of the Association of American Geographers and
              the National Council for Geographic Education to broaden the impact of the
              project, both to other faculty and institutions, and to K-12 teachers. 
A
              longitudinal evaluation/research component is assessing the value of this
              training to young faculty, particularly during the tenure review process. A
              final component involves publishing the workshop materials as a stand-alone
              course for use in graduate geography programs.
