Abstract    :
              
The project will expand the work of a teacher-researcher collaboration in the
              area of early literacy development, particularly early identification of and
              intervention for children at-risk for reading failure. The objectives of this
              work are threefold: (a) refine and pilot test the efficacy of a comprehensive
              literacy assessment and accompanying interventions to be used with at-risk
              children in kindergarten and first grade in preparation for a future
              large-scale efficacy study, (b) use the software tools developed by TIMSS
              Video-R project and LessonLab to create a digital video library of
              illustrations of literacy assessments and interventions, and to document
              changes in instructional practices in the classroom as a result of implementing
              the literacy assessment and intervention, and (c) using information from the
              pilot efficacy study and the digital library, begin to develop a model program
              for literacy assessment and intervention to be used in teacher professional
              development. 

The pilot efficacy study involves two treatment  conditions
              and one no-treatment comparison  condition. One of the treatment groups uses
              the assessment and interventions with full support from the project team for
              formative evaluation purposes, a second is supported only by the web-based
              (digitized  materials to examine the assessment s use under anticipated future
              implementation  conditions. If successful, this study will show that it is
              possible to affect change in reading out comes for at-risk  children by
              providing teachers with assessment tools and intervention  choices focused on
              early literacy development. Results of the study will aid in the design and
              implementation of the large-scale efficacy study and the development of a model
              program for early identification and intervention that  can be disseminated
              electronically.
