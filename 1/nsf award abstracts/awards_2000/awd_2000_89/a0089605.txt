Abstract    :
              This application requests funds for a conference of chemosensory scientists from
              universities in the Intermountain Region including Utah, Idaho, and Colorado. 
              The conference will meet on February 9-12, 2001 at Jackson, Wyoming.  Two
              outside speakers using novel functional imaging techniques will be invited. The
              meeting will be organized around three objectives: 1) presentation of
              innovative experimental techniques; 2) small group "brain storming" sessions to
              focus on identifying new directions for chemosensory studies applying the
              techniques described in the first objective; 3) establishment of collaborative
              projects.
The outcome of this meeting will be to establish new strategies for
              recording the functional activity of chemosensory neurons.  Synthesis of
              cutting edge research findings from scientists studying organisms ranging from
              insects, cephalopods, amphibians, fish, mammals, and man will lead to exciting
              new advances in the field.  A small number of participants with ample time for
              formal presentations and informal interactions will foster new collaborations
              and general sharing of expertise.  Graduate students, post-docs and research
              associates will have full access to faculty and be encouraged to actively
              participate in all sessions.  Efforts will be made to actively involve women
              and minorities in all aspects of the meeting.
