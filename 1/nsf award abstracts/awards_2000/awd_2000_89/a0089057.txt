Abstract    :
              Engineering - Civil (54) 

This project is producing an integrated educational
              framework to expose construction management students to the complexities of the
              construction site. The project is accomplishing this important goal through the
              development of a prototype web-based construction management gaming system -
              called WebProject - that integrates construction estimating, construction
              scheduling, and construction project management courses. Students entering the
              sequence of construction core courses receive a hypothetical construction
              project generated by WebProject that is utilized in the three courses. Teams of
              students undertake the role of construction management companies to perform
              construction estimating, construction scheduling, and construction project
              management functions by using the services of hypothetical trade contractors
              generated by WebProject.
