The African indigobirds (genus Vidua) are obligate brood
              parasites, reproducing only by laying their eggs in the nests of other species.
              Indigobirds are highly host-specific and the young parasites precisely mimic
              the mouth colors and patterns in the young of their respective hosts. As
              adults, male indigobirds mimic the songs of their hosts. This behavior results
              in the genetic cohesion of indigobird species because females also imprint on
              the host species and choose their mates based on song. These same behavioral
              mechanisms, however, may result in reproductive isolation and rapid speciation
              after the colonization of a new host species. This research will use molecular
              genetic markers to investigate the evolutionary history and genetic structure
              of indigobird species and populations using samples from over 500 indigobirds
              collected throughout Africa. In addition, an intensive field study in Cameroon
              will directly evaluate the incidence of ongoing hybridization and genetic
              introgression among indigobird populations using different hosts.

The
              indigobird system is a remarkable example of rapid evolutionary diversification
              and adaptive evolution and represents one of those unusual situations in which
              the evolutionary process can be studied in progress. This research will
              contribute to a renewed interest among evolutionary biologists in the
              mechanisms of speciation and the roles of natural and sexual selection in
              generating biodiversity. A clear understanding of the evolutionary history and
              genetic structure of indigobird populations will also lay the groundwork for
              future analyses of the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying mouth
              mimicry, the key genetic adaptation of these host-specific brood parasites.
