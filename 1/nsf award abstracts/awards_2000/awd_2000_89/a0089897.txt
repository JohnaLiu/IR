This award supports a third year of funding for Dr. Volker Sick
              and students from the University of Michigan in a collaboration with Christoph
              Schulz of the Department of Physical Chemistry at the University of Heidelberg
              in Germany.  The research funded by this award will improve laser-spectroscopic
              methods for the non-intrusive measurement of fuel and temperature distributions
              in direct-injection gasoline engines.  The collaboration brings together the
              unique expertise of the two groups.  The Heidelberg group has strong expertise
              in laser spectroscopy and quantitative diagnostic tools, and the Michigan group
              has fundamental knowledge and research experience in engine technology.  The PI
              also has strong contacts in the automotive industry, which is interested in the
              results of the research.  Much of the research will be performed by a graduate
              student from the PI's group working in Heidelberg.  Exchange of junior
              researchers is emphasized to add an international dimension to their training
              and to allow them to establish international connections early in their
              careers.
