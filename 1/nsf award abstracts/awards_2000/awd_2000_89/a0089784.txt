This award supports Ian Walmsley and students from the
              University of Rochester in a collaboration with Werner Vogel of the Department
              of Physics at the University of Rostock, Germany.  The project will focus on
              the nature of entangled states and their relation to the measurement of
              non-classicality.  The two groups will join forces to produce and study the
              entanglement of short biphotons and multimode squeezed light pulses.  They will
              also look at coupled anharmonic systems such as the vibrational and rotational
              states of molecules.  The investigations will require both theoretical and
              experimental work, which will make extensive use of the complementary expertise
              available from the German and U.S. groups.  Exchange of junior researchers is
              emphasized to add an international dimension to their training and to allow
              them to establish international connections early in their careers.
