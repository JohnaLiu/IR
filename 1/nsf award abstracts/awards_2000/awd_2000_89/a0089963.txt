Title:  Learning Behaviors and Background Characteristics that Promote

              Programs

This CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests
              funds to study how students' learning strategies and behaviors affect their
              performance in undergraduate computer science programs.  Since programming is
              one of the first skills that computer science students learn, and a stumbling
              block for many, the study will focus on students' programming learning
              strategies.  The study will consist of three main activities.  The first will
              be the identification of learning and programming behaviors that distinguish
              successful from unsuccessful CS students; and the determination of which
              behaviors, if any, are more characteristic of males than females (and the
              reverse) and Caucasian students than African American students (and the
              reverse).  The second activity will be the development and evaluation of an
              intervention to train effective learning and programming behaviors.  The third
              activity will be a survey of students and successful computer scientists to
              determine whether certain pre-college experiences predict effective learning
              behaviors and success in computer science.  This project has the potential to
              provide valuable insights into the recruitment and retention of women and
              underrepresented minorities in computer science majors.
