Abstract    :
              This award is for the partial support of the conference in the field of
              Approximation Theory at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. The conference
              will concentrate on various topics including classical approximation theory,
              wavelets, mutivariate splines and nonlinear approximation. The conference will
              be the tenth in a traditional triennial series of such conferences, held
              earlier at UT Austin, Texas A&M and Nashville.
