This award supports a third year of funding for William Kaska
              and students from the University of California-Santa Barbara in a collaboration
              with Hermann Meyer of the Department of Inorganic Chemistry at the University
              of Tuebingen in Germany.  The research funded by this award will develop
              rhodium and iridium phosphourous-carbon-phophorous (PCP) "Pincer" molecules
              which are stable up to 200 degrees centigrade.  This is significant for two
              reasons:  they catalytically dehydrogenate alkanes to alkenes which is
              important for commercial objectives; they produce hydrogen gas, which is
              potentially useful for fuel cells.  Both sides have unique expertise and
              facilities necessary to a successful outcome of this joint research project. 
              Exchange of junior researchers is emphasized to add an international dimension
              to their training and to allow them to establish international connections
              early in their careers.
