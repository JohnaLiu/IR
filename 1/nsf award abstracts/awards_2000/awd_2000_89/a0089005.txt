For this project the Mathematical
              Association of America is offering a series of workshops for advanced graduate
              students and college faculty at all levels of experience. The workshops are of
              two types: Five-day twenty person on-site workshops directed by experienced
              leaders with a history of effective innovative teaching and distance-learning
              workshops which are designed for faculty who are unable to attend the on-site
              workshops. The six summer 2001 workshops are being held across the US. Sites
              include Seattle, Boone in North Carolina, Ithaca (New York), Lancaster
              (Pennsylvania), Durham (New Hampshire) and Indiana (Pennsylvania). Workshop
              topics include geometry, mathematics and art, physics, calculus, statistics,
              and elementary education. Eight on-site workshops are planned for the summer of
              2002 and seven for the summer of 2003.

The goal of the project is to address
              the rapid and significant changes in undergraduate education. The project also
              addresses the specific needs of faculty at various stages of their professional
              careers. Thus, the project is designed to meet the needs of faculty with
              respect to changes in their environment and in their careers. For more
              information contact Tom Rishel at trishel@maa.org.
