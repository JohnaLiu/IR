Abstract    :
              Invasions of exotic organisms have disrupted many biotic communities worldwide.
              A unique example of an invasion that has undergone a reversal for unknown
              reasons is that of the browntail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, that was
              accidentally introduced to North America near Boston from Europe in 1897. It
              became an important defoliator of many tree species throughout New England and
              was also a human health hazard due to severe skin rashes caused by irritating
              hairs from the larvae. Beginning around 1915, however, browntail populations
              receded gradually to coastal enclaves at the tip of Cape Cod and on islands in
              Casco Bay in Maine, where high densities have persisted ever since. Little
              research of any kind has been done on browntail moth in North America and no
              studies have explained why it declined and why it persists in coastal enclaves.
              In recent years the populations in Casco Bay have expanded once more onto
              adjacent mainland areas and are a major concern.  No studies have evaluated its
              potential to spread or to become established in other coastal areas in North
              America. Our proposed research will help fill this void.
	The decline of
              browntail moth in North America coincided with the introduction and
              establishment of several parasitic flies that attack browntail moth. These
              included browntail specialists and the generalist Compsilura concinnata that
              was introduced against gypsy moth. Our research will test the hypothesis that
              browntail moth is confined to coastal enclaves because of lower levels of
              parasitism by C. concinnata or lower mortality from other natural enemies.
