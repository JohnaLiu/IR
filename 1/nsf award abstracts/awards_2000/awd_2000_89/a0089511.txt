Abstract    :
              During the past decade it has become clear that natural selection has major
              effects on patterns of DNA sequence variation across entire chromosomes of
              organisms as diverse as Drosophila, mice, humans, and tomato.  However, the
              extent to which the levels and patterns of molecular variation reflect adaptive
              Darwinian evolution versus purifying selection of deleterious mutations remains
              a mystery.  The studies proposed here will take advantage of the highly
              structured nature of Drosophila ananassae populations in Southeast Asia to
              estimate the extent to which limited gene flow, local adaptation, genetic
              drift, and recombination influence the architecture of the genome.  A dense set
              of molecular markers will be used to scan the genome for genes involved in
              local adaptation in populations along a latitudinal cline representing
              different climatic regions in Southeast Asia.  Genetic and physical maps will
              provide a means to examine the effect of natural selection across broad
              expanses of the genome.  Studies will also be performed to examine the patterns
              of polymorphism at genes in population samples of D. ananassae from the
              ancestral range of the species to estimate the geographic boundaries of natural
              selection on DNA sequence variation.

These studies explore the fundamental
              mechanisms shaping genome variation and diversity in structured Drosophila
              populations, providing insight into the processes responsible for molding
              genome diversity in other organisms with structured populations such as humans.
               The research involves international collaborations between the United States
              and Germany, and training opportunities for undergraduate students.
