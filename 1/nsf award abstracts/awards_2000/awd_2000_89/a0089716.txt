Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the evolutionary forces that lead to genetic
              variation within populations and the genetic differences between species. 
              Genetic variation within populations, which is often manifest as observable
              differences between individuals, is due to a delicate balance of forces:
              mutation injecting variation into populations and natural selection and/or
              random factors removing variation.  Genetic differences between species are due
              to these same forces, although natural selection is the only cause of
              evolutionary adaptations.  The proposed research will explore the nature of
              these forces, focusing in particular on the random factors that remove
              variation, on the mutations that caused physical differences between
              individuals, and on the mutations that cause different species to produce
              sterile or inviable offspring.  The methodology for this research involves the
              mathematical analysis and computer simulation of models of evolution followed
              by a comparison of the properties of these models to data that has been
              obtained by others.

The broader significance of this work concerns our
              understanding of the implications of genetic variation in such important human
              traits as disease susceptibility and in agricultural traits of economic
              importance.  In addition, this work will have a profound impact on our
              understanding of human origins and the recent patterns of human migration.
