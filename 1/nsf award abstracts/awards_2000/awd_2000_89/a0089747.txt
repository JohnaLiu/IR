This award supports Diane Aga and students from the University of
              Nebraska-Kearney in a collaboration with Rudolf Schneider of the Department of
              Agricultural Chemistry at the University of Bonn, Germany.  The project is
              coordinated with the PI's existing CAREER award from the Chemistry Division and
              will focus on the role of stereochemistry in the degradation of metolachlor, a
              commonly used herbicide in Europe and the U.S.  This is a highly complementary
              collaboration because the PI brings analytical strength and soil-science
              expertise while Dr. Schneider has expertise in plant metabolism and can provide
              actual plant-grown test samples.  The project also fosters education and
              training of junior researchers by providing them international experience early
              in their careers.
