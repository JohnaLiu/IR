This project consists of a
              set of experimental and numerical modeling studies of multicomponent arrays of
              droplets. Alkane fuels containing ethanol additive are studied. The addition of
              ethanol introduces processes not present in undoped alkane fuels, and these are
              the focus of the study. They include nonideal liquid effects in the droplet,
              Marangoni forces along the droplet surface, preferential diffusion of the
              additive into the gas phase, and real-gas influences on thermodynamic
              properties.  The study includes isolated droplets, droplets in arrays and
              groups, and interactions of droplets with hot and cold walls. The results are
              relevant to the use of fossil fuels in fuel-injected engines and the control of
              pollutants.
