Abstract    :
              This CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to
              study the underrepresentation of females and minorities in IT careers.  The
              study will use a theoretical framework based on expectancies, values, and
              achievement behaviors.  It was developed to study why females are
              underrepresented in mathematics, physics, and engineering.  For the past 17
              years, this framework has been used to study educational and occupational
              choices among children, adolescents, and young adults, using longitudinal
              survey designs that include multiple indicators from children, their parents,
              teachers, and school records.  As a result, there are three longitudinal data
              sets that will be used in the study.  In addition, the necessary supplementary
              IT-related data will be collected and added to the Michigan Study of Adolescent
              Life Transitions (MSALT) data set.  Part of this data will be collected via
              surveys and the rest via interviews.  This project has the potential to provide
              valuable insights into the underrepresentation of women and minorities IT
              careers.
