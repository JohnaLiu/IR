The Caltech Chemistry Animation Project combines the technical
              skills of faculty and students at Caltech with Emmy-award winning sound
              editors, Oscar-winning sound supervisors, Emmy-winning film editors,
              professional narrators, film score writers, computer graphics personnel from
              the Hollywood special effects industry, and advanced computer workstations to
              prepare instructional materials that are being used worldwide, at the high
              school and college levels, to allow students and teachers to understand better
              the fundamental concepts in their chemical world. The initial stages of this
              project have been highly successful, with distribution of materials currently
              proceeding in seven countries to audiences in excess of one million students.
              The continuation of this project is allowing us to complete a series of
              approximately 15 video tapes, comprising a library of fundamental concepts in
              the chemical sciences, for use by teachers and students worldwide. New videos
              being produced include: Atoms, Molecules, and Moles; Chemical Thermodynamics;
              Spectroscopy and Molecular Motion; Point Groups, Symmetry and Group Theory;
              Binary Crystals; and DNA/RNA/Proteins. These will complement the existing video
              titles covering the topics of Atomic Orbitals, VSEPR, Crystals,
              Stereochemistry, Nucleophilic Substitution, the Diels-Alder Reaction, Periodic
              Trends, and Molecular Orbitals.
