Naumann
This award supports Christoph Naumann and students from
              Indiana University-Purdue in a collaboration with Eva-Kathrin Schmidt of the
              Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry in  Munich, Germany.  The research focus
              is on development of appropriate artificial membrane architectures to allow
              studies of specific interactions of encoded proteins.  There will be a great
              demand for such studies once the human genome has been mapped.  This project
              uses the complementary facilities and expertise of the U.S. and German groups: 
              the U.S. side provides detailed knowledge about state-of-the-art membrane
              architectures for transmembrane proteins and the equipment necessary to make
              pertinent measurements; the German counterpart has expertise related to the
              preparation and characterization of the transmembrane proteins to be used in
              the research.    This joint collaborative research effort also presents junior
              researchers with the opportunity to work internationally, and the work done on
              this proposal will help institutionalize the relationship between the German
              and U.S. research groups.
