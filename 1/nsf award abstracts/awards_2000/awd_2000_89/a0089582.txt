Abstract    :
              This award is for support of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) to provide the
              leadership and management structure for the coordination of U.S. research
              activities in connection with the Earth System History (ESH) Project of the
              United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). The ESH Secretariat at
              AGU will provide support services for the ESH Steering Committee and a point of
              interaction and contact with the international effort in Past Global Changes
              (PAGES) of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). These
              efforts will include supporting activities of the ESH Steering Committee and
              other activities designed to generate paleoscience community input to ESH
              Project priorities and objectives. Workshops, planning meetings and
              publications will insure that the goals of the project are met and that
              implementation of the project is carried out in an effective manner.
