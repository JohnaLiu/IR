Abstract    :
              This research focuses on different kinds of organisms that live in intimate
              association.  Parasitism describes the most familiar pattern, in which a
              smaller organism lives on or inside a larger organism--the smaller parasite
              causing some harm to the larger host.  Parasitism is just one end of a
              continuum of associations.  In many cases, the larger host requires smaller,
              beneficial partners such as bacteria in order to digest special types of food
              or to provide essential nutrients.  

This theoretical research synthesizes
              the diverse ways in which organisms live together, identifies unanswered
              puzzles about how such associations arise and evolve, and proposes models to
              explain these puzzles in terms of ecological and evolutionary principles.  The
              mathematical and computer models are developed in a way that new laboratory and
              field studies can be designed to test the ideas and gain further insight into
              the biology of both parasitic and beneficial associations.  This work
              contributes to understanding why parasites vary in the amount of harm they
              cause to their hosts.  In addition, this research provides a broad conceptual
              framework for understanding interactions between microbes, such as populations
              of viruses or bacteria living within a host.
