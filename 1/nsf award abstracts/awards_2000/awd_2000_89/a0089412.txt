Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
The database course is a standard offering within
              computer science programs, yet the material remains inaccessible to many
              students because concrete examples and illustrations are too often lacking. The
              flat format of a paper text is not optimal for providing such materials.
              Therefore we are creating courseware for the database course that includes both
              animations and other materials to assist student learning of data modeling,
              SQL, query optimization and transaction processing. Students will be able to
              follow query processing through these animations rather than relying on
              theoretical abstractions. These materials will be valuable irrespective of the
              text chosen for a particular course. The materials will be evaluated at several
              different sites in order to judge their value and to optimize them.
