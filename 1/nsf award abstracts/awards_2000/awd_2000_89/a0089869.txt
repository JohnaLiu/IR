Workshop on Digital
              Government:  An Urban Research Agenda

This grant will support a workshop to
              define the information and computer science research agenda related to urban
              government issues.  It will involve a consortium of 17 urban universities
              (listed on page 4 of the proposal) called the Great Cities Universities, of
              which the University of Illinois Chicago is one.

Information and networking
              technologies now have the potential to affect a variety of domains of interest
              in an urban environment including land use, criminal justice, digital
              governance and democracy, GIS-supported issues such as housing and business
              locations, social welfare services, education, and many more.  This is a rich
              area of applications which should be of great interest to the computer and
              information science community.

This will be a joint effort of UIC's
              Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and UIC's College of
              Urban Planning and Public Affairs; both disciplines will be essential to the an
              effective workshop.
