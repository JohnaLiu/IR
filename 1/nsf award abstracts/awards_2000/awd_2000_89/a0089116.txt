Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for research by the Stanford University high
              energy physics group on the Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS)
              experiment currently under construction at Fermilab.  The MINOS collaboration
              was formed in October 1994, and currently it includes about 250 scientists and
              engineers from 30 institutions in five countries.  The experiment has as its
              goal the search for and study of neutrino oscillations in the range 10-3  < Dm2
              < 10-2  eV2 .  This is the mass-squared difference region indicated by the
              recent results from the SuperKamiokande experiment, and supported by data from
              the Soudan and MACRO experiments.
	To obtain the required "level arm", the
              MINOS experiment will use the beam of neutrinos produced by the Main Injector
              accelerator at Fermilab and detect them in the Soudan mine, about 730 km away. 
              In addition, a second smaller detector will be built close to the neutrino
              source at Fermilab to study the properties of neutrinos before they have had a
              chance to oscillate.  Presence of oscillations would exhibit itself as a
              difference in the nature and rate of interactions in the two detectors.  The
              Stanford group has been involved in the experiment from its inception and has
              played a major role in its intellectual leadership and management.  The current
              spokesman of the experiment is the PI of this proposal.  The major technical
              contributions of this group have been in software development and simulations. 
              It is intended to continue these efforts and to become involved significantly
              in the future in detector installation and some aspects of the beam hardware
              and beam monitoring system.
