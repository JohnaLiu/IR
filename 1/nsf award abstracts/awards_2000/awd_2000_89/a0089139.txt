Abstract    :
              The Sixth International Conference on Bacterial Locomotion and Signal
              Transduction (BLAST VI) will be held January 14-19, 2001, in Cuernavaca,
              Mexico. The conference, which is expected to have 200-250 participants, will
              focus on the molecular mechanisms of sensing and response in several bacterial
              systems. The meeting format is designed to foster extensive discussions of
              recent developments and ideas among researchers from the United States and
              abroad. Approximately 60 oral presentations and 100 posters will be included in
              the program, allowing virtually all laboratories working in this rapidly moving
              field
to present their key findings. Scientific sessions will compare and
              contrast the sensory and locomotor systems of a variety of prokaryotes,
              focusing on each fundamental step in their signal transduction pathways: (a)
              transmembrane signaling by chemo- and photo-receptors; (b) signal transmission
              by intracellular phosphorelay cascades; (e)sensory control of cellular
              motility, gene expression, and development; and (d) the mechanics of cell
              motility. Bacterial sensory systems have important functions in microbial
              ecology and in pathogenesis, and also provide useful models for understanding
              analogous signaling systems that occur in many eukaryotes. The BLAST meeting
              has become the principal forum for most investigators in this field to present
              their current findings and to discuss emerging concepts and generalizations
              concerning bacterial sensing and motility. A review of BLAST VI will be
              published, which will summarize key findings presented at the meeting and
              provide a readily accessible overview of the present state of the field.
