This award supports the participation of American
              scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on protein folding, function and funnels, to
              be held in Honolulu, Hawaii from January 13-19, 2002.  The co-organizers are
              professors Peter Wolynes and Luthey-Schulten of the University of Illinois at
              Urbana-Champaign and Professor Shoji Takada at Kyoto University in Japan.  The
              topic of protein folding is extremely important.  In recent years, protein
              folding has begun to be viewed in the context of a statistical mechanics-based,
              energy landscape theory.  This theory provides a framework in which
              quantitative treatment of complex dynamics of protein folding can be analyzed. 
              The theory starts with the statistical mechanical treatment of random polymer
              systems and proceeds by linking characteristic features of ensembles of
              proteins at various stages of folding to features and properties of the energy
              landscape of foldable proteins.  

 A major practical result of the energy
              landscape approach to protein folding has been a major advance in the success
              of algorithms for the prediction of protein structure from sequence, an
              important part of the post genomic paradigm of biology.  They are also
              important in their function, especially in the area of gene regulation.  The
              exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S.
              participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future
              collaborative projects.  Dissemination of information on the seminar will be
              available on the World Wide Web.
