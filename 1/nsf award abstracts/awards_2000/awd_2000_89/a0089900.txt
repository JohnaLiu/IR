Abstract    :
              This research seeks to determine the role of plant-microbe interactions on the
              production and fate of key trace gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon
              monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2). Recent observations have revealed that the
              roots of all plants produce CO, and that the roots of nitrogen-fixing plants
              (Fabacae, commonly legumes) produce large amounts of both CO and H2. 
              Production of these gases provides the basis for an interaction of plant roots
              with soil microbes that oxidize CO and H2. Field and greenhouse studies will
              involve a variety of cultivated and non-cultivated legumes and other plant
              taxa. Experimental analyses will include measurements of gas exchange in situ,
              measurements of root gas production, isolation and characterization of
              trace-gas utilizing microbes, and applications of molecular techniques based on
              the use of 16S rRNA and rubisco genes.  The research will lead to insights
              about the controls of atmospheric trace gas composition and the impacts of land
              use and agricultural practices.
