	With ichthyological colleagues from Argentina, Brazil,
              France, and Venezuela, Dr. John Lundberg of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
              Sciences is studying the systematics, evolution, and biogeography of the 90 or
              so species of "tiger stripe" catfishes of the family Pimelodinae of South
              America. They are a morphologically and ecologically diverse group of highly
              valued food fishes that range throughout the vast river basins of eastern South
              America, including the Amazon, Orinoco, and Parana drainages, with species also
              known from trans-Andean rivers. All 31 described genera in the family will be
              sampled, with the help of South American colleagues, and the expected 70-80
              species thus acquired will be analyzed for DNA sequences from mitochondrial and
              nuclear genes, for the construction of phylogenetic trees from comparisons of
              the mutational differences among species. Morphological studies of these
              samples and of museum collections will complement the molecular phylogenetic
              analyses, and French and South American colleagues will also add studies of the
              fossils for this group, of which 20 are currently known, from deposits dated
              back to Eocene times but suspected to extend back to the Cretaceous. 
	The
              dated phylogeny of pimelodine catfishes will be integrated with biogeographic
              data and reconstructions of the history of South America's large rivers and
              basins. The temporal patterns and rates of diversification within subclades of
              these fishes, and their time sequence relationships with Earth history events,
              will provide tests of suspected causal agents in South American biotic
              evolution. Significant components of the research involve colleagues from
              Argentina, Brazil, France, and Venezuela, many of whom will travel to
              Philadelphia for focused work sessions to integrate the molecular,
              morphological, and paleontological information.
