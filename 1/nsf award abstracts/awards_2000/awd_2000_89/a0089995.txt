Title:   Retention of Women and
              Minorities in the IT Workforce

This CISE Information Technology Workforce
              (ITW) proposal requests funds to study whether women and underrepresented
              minorities either trained in IT or employed in IT careers have different rates
              of retention and advancement.  The study also examines whether the rate by
              which individuals not trained in IT are absorbed into IT jobs differs by gender
              and minority status.  The study will use the NSF's SESTAT database, which is a
              comprehensive, integrated database containing information over time on the
              employment, educational, and demographic characteristics of scientists and
              engineers who possess at least a bachelor's degree.  This project has the
              potential to provide valuable insights about the retention and advancement of
              women and underrepresented minorities in IT careers.
