This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              involves Daniel C. Kilper, University of North Carolina at Charlotte and Guy M.
              Stephan and Pascal Besnard at the Ecole Nationale Superieue de Sciences
              Appliquees et de Technology in Lannion, France.  The objectives of this
              collaboration are to develop disk and ring optical microcavities and to combine
              common research on theory and application of microsphere resonators. 
              Experiments and calculations will be conducted. The collaboration takes
              advantage of complementary expertise and facilities.  The US investigator
              brings to this collaboration expertise in quantum optics, laser noise, and use
              of passive microcavities for laser frequency stabilization.  This is
              complemented by French expertise in microsphere lasers, microcavity fabrication
              techniques, and semiclassical laser theory.

This award represents the US
              side of a joint proposal to NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US
              investigator and graduate student. The CNRS will support the visits of French
              researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental
              understanding of microcavity devices, which have potential for communication,
              optical sensing and biomedical applications.
