Title:  Departmental Factors in Gendered Attrition from Undergraduate
              IT Majors
 
This CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal
              requests funds to address the disproportionate loss of women from undergraduate
              programs in computer science.  The objectives are to profile the top-producing
              U.S. computer science departments, to identify the departmental characteristics
              and practices that affect equal retention of male and female computer science
              majors, and to disseminate this information and make recommendations for action
              based on the study results.  One component of the project will be a survey of
              chairpersons and faculty from 227 computer science departments.  Fifteen of
              these departments will be randomly selected for on-site interviews of
              chairpersons, faculty, and students.  This project has the potential to provide
              significant insights about what kind of educational environment is likely to
              retain female students in computer science at rates comparable to male
              students.
