Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59) 


The goals of this project are to develop and test
              materials that (a) show engineering students the integration of theory,
              practice, and information technologies that occur in the real-world, (b)
              improve their higher-level cognitive skills, and (c) provide examples of teams
              of engineers and managers working together using information technologies to
              solve problems. The project is based on an earlier proof-of-concept effort,
              built around the case study entitled "Crist Power Plant", which helped
              engineering students to understand how expert systems are used in the
              real-world to solve complex problems that involve many criteria and several
              alternatives.

In the present project, eleven companies are working with us
              to create new case studies. We are also developing background competency
              materials, instructional manuals, multimedia CD-ROMs, web sites, and videos to
              support the case studies. The instructional materials are being tested with
              engineering students at three minority serving institutions as well as at four
              other Universities. In addition, as a pilot project, the concept of a case
              emporium is being evaluated. This case emporium provides student teams at
              Auburn and Mercer Universities an opportunity to work together in a virtual
              environment.
