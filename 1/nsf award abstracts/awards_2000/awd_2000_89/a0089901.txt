Abstract    :
              This award supports international travel for fifteen U.S. graduate students who
              would not otherwise be able to attend the Second AgentLink European Agent
              Systems Summer School being held in Saarbrucken, Germany, from August 14-18,
              2000. AgentLink, Europe's ESPRIT-funded Network of Excellence for agent-based
              computing, organizes the school (http://www.agentlink.org). It is a world-class
              event that will bring together internationally recognized researchers in the
              area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems to present introductory and
              advanced courses in the theoretical and practical aspects of agent-based
              computing. The objective of this award is to encourage and enable U.S. graduate
              students of outstanding merit who are interested in research in agent systems
              but have no current funding to attend this event. This travel grant will cover
              their travel, hotel, registration fees, and some subsistence. The Europeans are
              giving similar support to their graduate students (i.e., those at European
              universities who are registered AgentLink members). This travel grant allows a
              strong and diverse group of US graduate students to attend EASSS 2000 rather
              than just a small group of elite researchers. Further, because the summer
              school is in Europe, it provides a unique opportunity for American researchers
              to have direct contact with their European colleagues.
