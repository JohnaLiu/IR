Dissimilatory and assimilatory controls on
              nitrogen retention and loss: Oxygen and nitrate dynamics in tropical forest
              soils

In humid tropical forests, the combination of abundant rainfall, soils
              with high water-holding capacity, and high metabolic activity can lead to
              conditions where oxygen is rapidly and completely consumed in the soil.  These
              conditions also increase the potential for nitrogen trace gas loss and
              leaching. In a global context, tropical forests currently have the highest N2O
              emissions, and can exhibit large nitrogen losses to groundwater relative to
              temperate forests. Despite this high potential for nitrogen loss, tropical
              forest plant productivity is not generally nitrogen limited. Dr. Silver and
              colleagues propose to combine field and laboratory experiments to study
              nitrogen retention (via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, and plant
              and microbial uptake) and nitrogen loss (via leaching and denitrification) in
              forests of Puerto Rico. This research will contribute to our understanding of
              the mechanisms controlling nitrogen dynamics in humid tropical forests, and
              improve our ability to predict the effects of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition
              and global change on nitrogen cycling
