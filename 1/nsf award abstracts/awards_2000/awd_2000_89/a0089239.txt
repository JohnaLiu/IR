Abstract    :
              Astronomy education researchers require a validated content assessment
              instrument.  The Collaboration for Astronomy Education Research has designed a
              21 question test (the Astronomy Diagnostic Test, ADT) for undergraduate
              non-science majors that covers selected astronomical topics likely to be
              included during undergraduate non-science instruction.  This instrument is
              intended to be given as a pre-test and as a post-test.  The ADT was
              administered to approximately 2500 students at 26 different institutions during
              1999.  Approximately fifty video and audio interviews, and thirty written
              responses for each questions were collected during 1998 and 1999.  Preliminary
              statistical analysis and validation tests have been done for the ADT.  This
              project would complete the validation process through consultation with a
              psychometrician, disseminate the results, construct a dedicated web site
              providing access to the instrument along with databases for comparison of
              results with other similar institutions, and explore the needs of the community
              for a "next generation ADT."
