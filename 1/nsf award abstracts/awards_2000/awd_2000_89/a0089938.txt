Fundamental insights into
              the governing mechanisms for turbulent flows have typically been obtained using
              advanced experimental methods.  More recently, "Direct Numerical Simulations
              (DNS)" of the Navier-Stokes equations permit such insights to be derived from
              computations.  The fundamental limitation for the latter is the number of grid
              nodes that can be utilized.  This limitation effects the Reynolds number in
              terms of the ratio of the largest to the smallest scales of the motion.

The
              PI will exploit, along with his student, a unique opportunity to carry out DNS
              computations at significantly larger R-values than those previously available. 
              It is expected that significant insights into scaling effects, Lagrangian
              transport and scalar mixing will result.
