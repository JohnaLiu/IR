This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              involves Keith E. Gubbins of North Carolina State University and Roland J.-M.
              Pellenq of the Centre de Recherche sur la Matiere Divisee in Orleans, France
              for studies of disordered porous materials, in particular, glasses and carbons.
               These materials are widely used in the chemical, oil and gas and
              pharmaceutical industries as adsorbents for chromatography and as catalysts and
              catalyst supports.  The collaboration addresses the development of realistic
              atomistic models to better characterize porous materials and to study phase
              changes and adsorption.  The investigators will use molecular simulation
              techniques combined with experimental studies of the structure of these
              materials.  The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
              applying molecular simulation methods to porous solids.  This is complemented
              by French expertise in experimental structure measurements and reconstruction
              methods.  

This award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF
              and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover
              travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator, postdoctoral
              researcher and graduate student. The CNRS will support the visits of French
              researchers to the United States.  The collaboration will advance understanding
              of adsorption in disordered materials.
