Long-term experiments performed at large spatial scales are
              costly, logistically difficult, and, as a consequence, seldom well replicated.
              But because smaller-scale experiments may not readily scale up to larger
              contexts, large-scale experiments may be critically important in understanding
              the processes influencing ecological communities in natural ecosystems. This
              LTREB project will continue the study of a naturally replicated,
              whole-ecosystem perturbation brought about by disease-induced reductions in
              populations of a dominant herbivore, the caddisfly, in cold water streams in
              Michigan and Maine. Maintenance of caddisfly populations at low levels by
              repeated outbreaks of a host-specific pathogen was first observed in the late
              1980's in several hydrologically stable streams in Michigan's Lower Peninsula
              that were already the subject of long-term monitoring. Results to date from
              these systems indicate that biotic processes play a major role in organizing
              their communities. In the mid-1990's, a foundation was laid to assess the
              generality of these findings through the addition of study streams in two
              regions (western Upper Peninsula, Michigan, western Maine) having similar
              communities as the Michigan Lower Peninsula sites, but where
              hydrologically-derived disturbances should be more pronounced and frequent.
              This study will continue monitoring of biotic communities in streams in all
              three regions that have had, or are likely to have, substantial
              pathogen-induced variation in their caddisfly populations over time. These data
              series will allow the investigators to (1) discriminate among mechanistic
              models of trout stream community dynamics, (2) determine whether the long-term
              interactions between caddisfly and its pathogen is cyclic or stable, and (3)
              assess whether the relative importance of biotic and abiotic processes in
              affecting trout stream communities varies over a gradient of hydrologic
              stability.
