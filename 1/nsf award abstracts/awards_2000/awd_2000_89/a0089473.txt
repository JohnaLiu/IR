Understanding the diversity of nature and managing our
              natural heritage require detailed knowledge of the ways in which plant and
              animal populations interact with their environments.  In turn, such
              interactions depend primarily on characteristics of life histories:  patterns
              of reproduction, survival, and growth.  

This research examines the
              evolution of reproduction, specifically the number of offspring born into
              litters, in a model study species (Columbian ground squirrels of the Rocky
              Mountains).  Experiments that cross-foster different numbers of offspring among
              mothers will reveal the basic principles of how mothers care for young during
              the important period of lactation, when young depend on milk.  The experiments
              will reveal how mothers and young grow and survive under conditions of larger
              and smaller litters, and under conditions of limited and abundant food
              resources.

The results will determine whether, as evolutionary theory
              predicts, there is an ideal ("optimal") number of young in litters, either
              among all mothers or for each individual mother.  Also, the long-term success
              of mothers that exhibit different levels of investment in reproduction and
              survival will be revealed.  From these tests of theory, a better explanation of
              the evolution of life histories should emerge.  In turn, the research will
              provide us with improved understanding and better management of natural
              populations.
