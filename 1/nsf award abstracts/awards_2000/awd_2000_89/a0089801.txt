Abstract    :
              0089801.  John Silander.  

This proposal addresses two long-standing,
              fundamental, and interrelated questions in biology:  (1) what are the
              environmental factors that determine the distribution of species, and (2) what
              are the ecological and biogeographic mechanisms that cause spatial variation in
              species richness?  To answer these questions, the proposed research takes
              advantage of a well-documented database concerning the species-rich Protea
              flora from the Cape Floristic Kingdom of South Africa, a global hot spot of
              biodiversity.  

The PIs will integrate distributional data into a geographic
              information system (GIS), and subsequently analyze them from two quantitative
              perspectives, including hierarchical or Bayesian models and hybrid models based
              on cellular automata and simulation.  Modeling will be expansive and include
              considerations of environmental variables, species attributes (including
              phylogenetic relationships), explicit spatial location (not simply ranges), and
              population dynamic (e.g., vital rates of birth, death, and migration) as well
              as evolutionary characteristics (e.g., speciation) of taxa.  The full
              analytical protocol will include model construction, validation, and
              comparison.  Modeling will facilitate a mechanistic understanding and the
              prediction of where a particular species will occur, and how such
              species-specific mechanisms give rise to broader-scale patterns of species
              richness.
