Abstract    :
              The objectives of this study are to enhance our understanding of medium-range
              synoptic meteorology and to improve medium-range weather predictions. The focus
              is on the dynamic evolution of the upper-tropospheric weather systems such as
              troughs and cutoff cyclones. Theoretical wave stability and propagation
              analysis and potential vorticity diagnostics are applied to four different
              aspects of the problem: the mechanism associated with midwinter suppression of
              storm activity in the North Pacific; mechanisms for the formation and
              dissipation of coherent vortices; upper-tropospheric control on the severe
              storm environment; and the propagation of mobile Rossby wave packets in the
              upper troposphere.
