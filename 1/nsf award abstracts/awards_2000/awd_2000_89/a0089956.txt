This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              involves Joseph M. DeSimone of the NSF Science and Technology Center for
              Environmentally Responsible Solvents and Processes at the University of North
              Carolina and Patrick Lacroix-Desmazes of the Ecole Nationale Superieure de
              Chimie, Montpellier, France.  The project addresses the synthesis of novel
              fluorinated block copolymers using nitroxides, their characterization in
              supercritical carbon dioxide solution and subsequent use in the dispersion
              polymerization of styrene, methacryaltes, acrylates and copolymers. The US
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in using supercritical
              carbon dioxide as a polymerization solvent.  His group will characterize the
              solution properties of the fluorinated co-polymers; and perform static light
              scattering studies.  This is complemented by French expertise in the synthesis
              of copolymers.  The French laboratory will make the copolymers by a living
              free-radical polymerization process based on the use of nitroxides. Fluorinated
              block copolymers, a class of industrially important polymers, are typically
              insoluble in traditional organic and halogenated solvents.  The proposed
              collaboration will advance understanding of characterization of  fluorinated
              block copolymers and the use of  super critical carbon dioxide as an
              environmentally benign method for producing them.

This award represents the
              US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for
              Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover the expenses of visits of members
              of the US research group. The CNRS will support the visits of French
              researchers to the United States.
