Abstract    :
              Oceanography (43) It is rare for courses in fluid dynamics to be remembered as
              defining educational experiences in large part, we believe, because laboratory
              experimentation and demonstration seldom play a central role. In recent years
              we have been developing laboratory-based courses at MIT in which artfully
              chosen experiments based on "research classics" demonstrate principles of
              rotating fluid mechanics, cultivate physical intuition and nurture and develop
              experimental skills. Students and faculty have found it a very rewarding
              experience. This project is developing a) a prototype undergraduate laboratory
              course for use in teaching of rotating fluid dynamics, b) non-invasive methods
              to obtain quantitative measurements from experiments, and c) a laboratory guide
              to help faculty and students at other schools learn fluid mechanics in a
              laboratory-based setting. The undergraduate course, which is now recognized by
              MIT as an "Institute Laboratory", provides the context in which, we are
              developing and evaluating the experiments and teaching methods. Our target
              audience is sophomores, juniors and seniors majoring in earth science or
              environmental engineering. But a wide range of students from other science or
              engineering disciplines are also benefiting.
