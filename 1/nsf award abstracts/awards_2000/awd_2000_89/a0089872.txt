Title:  Collaborative Research: Statistical Methodology for
              Studying Women and Minorities in Information Technology Careers Using CPS and
              SESTAT Data


This CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal
              requests funds to find a statistical methodology for dealing with the
              limitations of data sets with small sample sizes for special subgroups of
              interest.  The data sets to be used for the study are the Current Population
              Survey (CPS) and the NSF's SESTAT database.  The researchers propose to study,
              develop, and demonstrate methods of statistical inference that will provide
              improved inferential conclusions than currently appear in the literature. 
              These methods will address questions of whether or not, after taking into
              account all the relevant background characteristics such as education and
              experience, there are disparities in salary, promotion rates, and job
              responsibilities among women and underrepresented minorities in IT.  They will
              also attempt to identify unique characteristics of successful women and
              underrepresented minorities in IT careers. This project has the potential to
              provide improved methodology for researchers using the CPS and SESTAT data sets
              as well as insights about women and underrepresented minorities who pursue IT
              careers.
