Abstract    :
              This project will develop a large-scale professional development strategy in
              mathematics and science to support pre-service and beginning K-12 teachers in
              mathematics and science. As part of the planning effort, the research team will
              formalize partnerships with major education organizations and engage in
              prototype development and feasibility research to develop models for courses,
              activities, and tools that will support the preparation of new teachers. The
              proposed professional development model would be most appropriate for college
              students in their junior and senior years or in post-baccalaureate programs, as
              well as for those in their first two years of teaching. The outcome of the
              planning grant will be a fully developed plan, with supporting research and
              evidence data, for the full scale implementation of the proposed effort.
