Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) The aim of this project is to establish a basic
              molecular biology lab that, in the context of a new course in Molecular
              Biology, will implement research-based experiments into the curriculum. The
              project intends to adapt the NSF-supported "Classroom Guide to Yeast
              Experiments" to an interesting, unknown research question that serves as a
              starting point for molecular biology students. The experimental approaches
              provide students with hands-on training in key molecular biology protocols that
              are applied to a research problem regarding transcriptional control and the
              evolutionary conservation of important molecules. The Molecular Biology lab is
              designed in a manner that enables students to analyze genes at three
              fundamental levels, namely, DNA, RNA, and Proteins, using both in vitro and in
              vivo approaches, as well as produce student learning outcomes. The course
              emphasizes the importance of understanding methodologies, molecular approaches,
              and instrumentation that have revolutionized biology and are key to diagnosis
              and prevention of disease, as well as allow the students to debate the ethical
              considerations that some of these new technologies pose. The equipment being
              acquired is also being used to improve the laboratory component of other
              biology courses, namely Genetics, Cell Physiology, and Biochemistry, thereby
              modernizing the Biology curriculum at UOG. Specific equipment like the PCR
              Thermal Cycler and gel electrophoresis apparatus is being used for the
              non-major Human Biology course offered as a general education requirement, in
              order to demonstrate applications of molecular biology in forensic sciences,
              paternity cases, anthropological and archaeological investigations.
