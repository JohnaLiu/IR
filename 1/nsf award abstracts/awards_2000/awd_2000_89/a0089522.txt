              Government:  dg.o Workshop and Publicity

This grant will support a series of
              three annual workshops for the grantees of the Digital Government Program,
              their Federal government research partners, and other interested parties
              (local, tribal, state government representatives, the press, industry).  The
              purpose of the workshops are for grantees to share their most current research
              findings, for agencies to contribute their problems and mission interests, and
              to begin to form a community for those interested in information technology
              research and development related to government information services.
