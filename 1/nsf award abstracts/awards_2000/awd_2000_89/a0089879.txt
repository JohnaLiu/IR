Title:  Ties That Blind?  The Role of Social Networks in the
              Underrepresentation of Women in IT

This CISE Information Technology
              Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds for a large-scale study of the role of
              social networks in the underrepresentation of women in the IT workforce. 
              Multiple cohorts of undergraduate and master's degree students in a leading MIS
              program will be surveyed at five points in time to identify their patterns of
              communication, trust, advice, friendship, and voluntary association in
              organizations.  Their work roles on project teams, in student organizations,
              and in first jobs after graduation will be tracked.  Background information
              will also be collected.  The differential positions of women students in the
              networks, roles, and job placements will be analyzed using the techniques of
              network analysis as well as standard techniques of statistical inference.  The
              influence of background characteristics, such as work experience and prior
              organizational affiliations will also be investigated.  This project has the
              potential to provide significant insights about the degree to which personal
              networks contribute to the success of women in IT education and employment.
