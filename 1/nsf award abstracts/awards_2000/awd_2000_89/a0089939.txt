Abstract    :
              The long-term consequences of acid rain on nutrient cycling in terrestrial
              ecosystems are not clearly understood, despite the widespread occurrence of
              acid rain in Europe and the eastern United States. This study provides a unique
              opportunity to document the effects of acidic deposits on northern forest
              ecosystems by comparing archived samples of forest soil with modern samples
              collected at the same locations ~100 and ~50 years after the original sampling.
              The historical samples, thought to be the oldest archived soil samples in the
              world, were collected in Eastern Europe and Russia before the onset of strong
              acidic deposition. The researchers will evaluate changes in soil-vegetation
              systems in northwestern Russia through analysis of base cations, different
              forms of aluminum, and other elements in soils and trees. In addition to
              advancing knowledge of the effects of acid rain, this research is important for
              understanding forest health under future global climate changes, increased
              concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and continuing anthropogenic
              pollution of the atmosphere with sulfur and nitrogen oxides.
