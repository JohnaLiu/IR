Abstract    :
              Anticipated rapid climatic change over the next decades to centuries raises the
              concern that plant populations will be unable to migrate fast enough to track
              changing environmental conditions.  Migration rates depend on dispersal of seed
              and on barriers to population spread, such as mountain ranges, large water
              bodies, and patterns of urban and agricultural land use.  Range expansions at
              the end of the last ice age provide evidence that populations tracked global
              change in the past, but current evidence does not indicate the speed of these
              migrations.  The proposed research will determine the pathways of past
              population spread and provide insights into rates of corresponding migrations. 
              We will construct and analyze maps of chloroplast DNA variation across the
              ranges of common eastern North American tree species.  Such maps reveal the
              "genetic fingerprint " of late-glacial refugia and post-glacial migration
              routes, and complement existing data for fossil pollen.  The maps of
              post-glacial migration we will provide a framework for analysis of population
              expansion.  Results will be used to test hypotheses concerning how growth of
              trees and dispersal of seeds affect the potential of plants to track rapid
              environmental change.
