Abstract    :
              By identifying natural selection at the level of DNA sequences, it possible to
              address questions regarding molecular evolution and to identify genomic regions
              or sites in the DNA sequence of special functional importance. In this project
              new statistical methods for identifying and interpreting patterns of selection
              will be developed.  A Bayesian method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
              will be developed that will provide a more powerful and versatile tool for
              identifying selection at the level of the DNA sequence.  Methods for estimating
              the age of a mutation, for estimating the distribution of selection
              coefficients and for detecting correlated evolution in DNA sequences will also
              be developed

The new methods will be applied to several data sets,
              particularly data sets of viral sequences such as HIV-1 sequences.  One of the
              questions that will be addressed is how often compensatory mutations occur in
              the evolution of drug resistance in the HIV-1 virus.  The new methods will be
              applicable in many genomic studies, particularly for identifying regions or
              sites of functional importance.
