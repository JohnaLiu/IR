Abstract    :
              This project will implement a research agenda that will provide a rigorous
              longitudinal evaluation of the effectiveness of a scalable, school-wide model
              of reading improvement (Reading--FIRST). The research will provide information
              on a number of related theoretical and practical questions related to teacher
              thinking, school change, student learning, parent involvement, educational
              supervision, and the use of technology in the professional development of
              teachers.  The results of the study will provide insights into how large scale
              interventions work in a wide variety of school contexts. 

Reading--FIRST was
              developed for grades K-12); this project covers only grades K-5). It  addresses
              major alterable factors related to instructional improvement that have been
              identified in prior studies, including increasing the amount of instruction,
              improving essential content coverage, and fostering greater continuity within
              schools. Reading--FIRST has been field-tested in more than 200 schools. An
              interdisciplinary team of educators, psychologists, statisticians, and
              technology experts will conduct the series of related research studies, using
              quantitative and qualitative data drawn from students, teachers, principals,
              and parents.
