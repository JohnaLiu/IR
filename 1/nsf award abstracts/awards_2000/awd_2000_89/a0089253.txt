This award supports David Stern and students from the Boyce
              Thompson Institute of Cornell University in a collaboration Andreas Weihe of
              Department of Biology at the Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany.  The
              project will focus on plant organelle ribonucleic acid polymerases (RNAPs) of
              apparently viral origin.  The collaboration brings together unique expertise
              and facilities:  the German laboratory specializes in the requisite molecular
              tools and the U.S. laboratory in organism-specific techniques.  The project was
              begun by the isolation of an RNAP gene from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and
              initial data indicates that the species might not contain a viral RNAP in its
              chloroplast, but only in the mitochondria.  The specific objective of the
              research in the next couple of years will be to determine definitively the
              subcellular localization of the protein encoded by the already cloned nuclear
              gene, to search for additional homologues, to see conclusively if a viral type
              RNAP exists in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts, and to investigate transcriptional
              regulation in mitochondria.  Exchange of junior researchers is emphasized to
              add an international dimension to their training and to allow them to establish
              international connections early in their careers.
