This research addresses the
              importance and strength of mechanisms involved in feedbacks and interactions
              among major components of lower food webs in floodplain river ecosystems.  The
              work will explore how temporal heterogeneity due to seasonal flood pulses
              influences these food webs.   Floods lead to a nutrient pulse into aquatic
              ecosystems that varies over time and over space.  These floods may cause time
              lags in the reciprocity of consumer resource interactions, so that
              donor-control does not dominate the system continuously.  A series of fish
              exclosure/enclosure experiments will be used to explore fish effects on alge
              and particulate organic matter over the annual hydrocycle.  Experiments will be
              conducted during three phases of the hydrocycle.  The research will be
              completed in South American tropical riverine floodplains.  The work will be
              significant in enhancing scientific understanding of the relative effects of
              donor vs. consumer control in relation to ecosystem dynamics and it will help
              elucidate how ecosystems link species to landscapes.
