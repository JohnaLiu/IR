This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              in astronomy involves Stephen E. Schneider of the University of Massachusetts
              at Amherst and Chantal Balkowski of the Observatoire de Paris.  The
              investigators will conduct joint observations using the Nancay and Arecibo
              radiotelescopes.  The complementarity of these instruments will allow for:  (1)
              new measures of the combined stellar and gaseous baryonic content of galaxies;
              (2) searches for gas-rich galaxies dominated by old, red populations of stars;
              (3) detection of large-scale structures into deep regions of the universe
              beyond our Galaxy; and (4) examination of motions of galaxies relative to
              large-scale structure. The project is part of the 2-Micron All Sky Survey
              (2MASS) which generates images of the entire sky at near-infrared wavelengths.
              Faint and low surface brightness galaxies in the 2MASS survey are the foci of
              this collaboration. The project takes advantage of complementary expertise of
              the US and French investigators, combines data generated by the 2MASS and the
              21 cm radio observations at Nancay.

This award represents the US side of a
              joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US
              investigator and undergraduate student.  CNRS will support the visits of French
              researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental
              understanding of the mechanisms of star formation in normal galaxies and low
              surface brightness galaxies.
