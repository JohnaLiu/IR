Abstract    :
              This award funds the activities of the Global Analysis, Integration, and
              Modelling Task Force (GAIM) Office of the International Geosphere Biosphere
              Program (IGBP). The goal of GAIM is to advance the study of the coupled
              dynamics of the Earth system using data and models. The challenge of the GAIM
              office, housed at the University of New Hampshire, is to initiate and
              facilitate activities that will lead to the rapid development and application
              of a suite of Global Prognostic Biogeochemical Models. 

A major new focus
              for the next three years of GAIM activities will be to enhance the scientific
              community's capability to address the Earth system as a whole using model
              coupling and integration. The first challenge will be to coordinate the
              development of Earth-system Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) by
              research groups throughout the world. These models show great promise for
              highlighting critical feedbacks and interactions that control the stability and
              sensitivity of the Earth system to anthropogenic perturbations. Next, models
              with system-level integration will be developed that integrate full-complexity
              subsystem models into Comprehensive Earth System models. Such models pose a
              different set of challenges to researchers in terms of space, time scale, and
              boundary conditions.
