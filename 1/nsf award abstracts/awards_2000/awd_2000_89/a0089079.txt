Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)  

The purpose of this project is to build upon a
              successful pilot project (EPTTS or Engineering Project Team Training System,
              which included the development of a student training module about cognitive
              style differences; a faculty training workshop which assisted instructors in
              adapting the module for their own classes; and an extensive assessment base
              which included qualitative data from focus groups and quantitative survey
              results from BESTEAM developed evaluation tools) and develop an integrated and
              longitudinal (involving students across their entire engineering education
              experience) engineering curriculum model to improve learning in project team
              environments. 

A primary goal of this effort is to design supportive faculty
              tools/aids (called modules) of team training skills that can be flexibly
              integrated into virtually any existing engineering program. A second major
              outcome of our efforts will be extensive faculty training via workshops and
              summer retreats in the adaption of the materials for use in their own classes.
              In addition, this project seeks to add to the literature base of engineering
              education by investigating how social cognitive career theory-SCCT- can help
              explain aspects of individual and team's behavior. Finally, by focusing on team
              skill building and related 'process skills', we expect that the BESTEAMS
              curriculum will act as a positive intervention in the retention of minorities
              and women in engineering.
