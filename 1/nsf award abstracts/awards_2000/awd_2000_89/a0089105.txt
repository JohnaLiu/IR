SGER: Long-term recovery of riparian structure
              and ecological processes following flooding in savanna landscapes

In early
              2000, floods in Southern Africa inundated large areas of the Mozambique coastal
              plain.  Rivers draining Kruger National Park experienced flows of ~8,000 m3/s
              (~150 year return interval), causing widespread removal of riparian vegetation
              and extensive alterations to channel geometry.   The floods caused widespread
              human suffering but also provided a truly unique research opportunity.  For the
              first time in nearly a century there is the possibility to describe and
              manipulate the long-term recovery of riverine forests. This project will
              involve the construction and equipping of large animal exclosures to
              investigate the recovery of the vegetation and soils over long periods in areas
              with and without the influences of megafauna, and under experimental water,
              nutrient, and fire regimes. Research questions are related to the effects of
              large animal browsing (e.g., elephant, buffalo, hippopotamus) on vegetative
              recovery, the type and role of nutrients involved in recovery, the extent and
              role of exotic plants after a major disturbance, and the effects of natural wet
              and dry climate cycles on the vegetation.  The need for the exclosures is
              urgent and immediate since the South Africa growing season begins in September,
              2000.
