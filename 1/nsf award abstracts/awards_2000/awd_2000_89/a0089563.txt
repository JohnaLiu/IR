Abstract    :
              Under this award, the PIs will study the climatology and interannual variability
              of African easterly wave disturbances as simulated by a 50 km resolution
              Regional Climate Model (RCM). Multiple 4-month RCM simulations will be
              undertaken. The PI will examine the physical processes responsible for the
              Atlantic sector African climate variability and predictability on seasonal,
              interannual and decadal time scales. The RCM will be used in a purely
              predictive mode with persistent SSTA and GCM-predicted lateral boundary
              conditions. Work will be undertaken in collaboration with the Niger
              Meteorological Service. In the final phase of the project, the climate response
              to greenhouse gas buildup will also be studied. The work is important because
              it will increase our knowledge of west African climate variability and
              predictability. This could have important societal impacts.
