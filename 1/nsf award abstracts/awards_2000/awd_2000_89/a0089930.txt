Title:  Collaborative Research: Statistical Methodology for Studying
              Women and Minorities in Information Technology Careers Using CPS and SESTAT
              Data

This CISE Information Technology Workforce (ITW) proposal requests
              funds to find a statistical methodology for dealing with the limitations of
              data sets with small sample sizes for special subgroups of interest.  The data
              sets to be used for the study are the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the
              NSF's SESTAT database.  The researchers propose to study, develop, and
              demonstrate methods of statistical inference that will provide improved
              inferential conclusions than currently appear in the literature.  These methods
              will address questions of whether or not, after taking into account all the
              relevant background characteristics such as education and experience, there are
              disparities in salary, promotion rates, and job responsibilities among women
              and underrepresented minorities in IT.  They will also attempt to identify
              unique characteristics of successful women and underrepresented minorities in
              IT careers. This project has the potential to provide improved methodology for
              researchers using the CPS and SESTAT data sets as well as insights about women
              and underrepresented minorities who pursue IT careers.
