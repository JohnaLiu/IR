	Rice, Oryza sativa, is the world's most important food crop. It
              is one of two cultivated species (with African cultivated rice, O. glaberrima)
              in a genus with 21 additional wild species, distributed in Asia, Africa,
              Australia, and Latin America. Both diploid and tetraploid species are known
              (plants with double the number of chromosomes), the latter suspected to be
              stabilized hybrids of various combinations of diploid (2n=24) rices. With
              colleagues in the U.S. and China, Dr. Tao Sang is addressing four major goals
              related to the evolution and classification of rice species: (1) reconstruct a
              phylogeny of the 23 species of Oryza and nearby grass relatives from gene
              sequences from 12 nuclear single- or few-copy genes plus the chloroplast matK
              gene; (2) determine with nuclear and chloroplast molecular markers the likely
              species parentage of the tetraploid rices, including the likely maternal
              parent; (3) add new single-copy or low-copy nuclear genes to the systematist's
              toolkit for species-level phylogenetic resolution; and (4) integrate genomic
              methods with modern systematic practices, particularly in the analysis of
              hybrids and polyploids. Dr. Sang has accumulated preliminary comparative data
              for 7 nuclear genes already, thought to mark 5 different linkage groups
              (chromosomes) of rice; the goal of the 12 genes is to represent nearly all 12
              chromosomes in combined-genes analyses, to determine congruence and distinguish
              "gene phylogenies" from "species phylogenies." Collaboration with Dr. Song Ge
              at the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences has ensured
              representative sampling of all species of Oryza and of several outgroup taxa,
              usually from multiple accessions. Special efforts are being made to detect
              cases of gene silencing or deletion at homoeologous loci in the tetraploids,
              and to search for patterns in such changes that may prove of general
              significance in the evolution of polyploid plants.
