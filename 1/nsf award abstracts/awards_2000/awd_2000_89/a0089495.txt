Fragmentation and population declines jeopardize the survival
              of many species.  Excessive reproductive isolation can cause a loss of valuable
              alleles, decrease genetic variation, induce inbreeding depression, reduce
              demographic fitness, and lead to reproductive failure. When tree populations
              are reduced to scattered and clustered individuals, pollen movement is critical
              to connectivity. This project develops a novel approach that can cover
              landscape-scale areas and can be integrated into spatially explicit simulation
              modeling of landscape changes. These new tools are deployed to investigate a
              threatened tree species, California Valley oak (Quercus lobata). Using allozyme
              and microsatellite genotypes, the investigators examine three objectives: (1)
              They will characterize reproductive isolation of individual trees in landscapes
              with variable conspecific density. (2) They will examine the impact of adult
              genetic structure and temporal heterogeneity of pollen pools on estimates of
              pollen movement. (3) They will incorporate estimated parameters into geographic
              models to simulate the impact of historical and future population
              decline.

This project represents an excellent case study of the evolutionary
              dynamics of gene flow and its landscape scale conservation/restoration
              consequences. It will be applied to a critical California tree species
              experiencing habitat loss and degradation from residential and agricultural
              development, a situation in need of information for future management and
              policy decisions.  This research will dovetail issues from evolutionary
              biology, conservation biology, geography, and public policy of the threatened
              species.
