Title:  Predictors of Women's Interest and
              Retention in Undergraduate IT Majors

This CISE Information Technology
              Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to study the barriers that discourage
              women from taking courses in IT and the causes of their low retention in IT. 
              The project will consist of three studies.  Study 1 uses a test-retest
              experiment to assess the impact of female IT role models on stereotypes and
              level of knowledge about IT.  Study 2 is longitudinal; undeclared students'
              course taking patterns in IT will be followed from their first semester to the
              end of their third year.  Study 3 is also longitudinal and examines predictors
              of undergraduate women's retention in IT.  This research will look at interest
              in IT along a continuum ranging from complete lack of interest, to lukewarm
              interest (taking a general level course which does not carry credit toward the
              major), to more serious interest (taking an introductory course designed for
              potential majors), to committed interest (declaring the major).  Likewise, the
              study of attrition will look not only at female IT majors who drop out of IT
              but also at women who leave the IT pipeline after taking only one or two
              courses.  This project has the potential to provide significant insights about
              the recruitment and retention of women in IT majors.
