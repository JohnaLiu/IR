Abstract    :
              Anthropology (81)This project is an invited session at the American
              Anthropology Association national meeting during November 15-19, 2000. It is
              sponsored by the General Anthropology Division and features ten papers and
              demonstrations of online courses along with critical discussion of
              computer-mediated teaching and learning. The session is entitled: "Internet
              Dreaming: Information Technology and the restructuring of Post-Secondary
              Education". This session will serve the purpose of providing maximum exposure
              to new developments in computer mediated teaching and learning in undergraduate
              anthropology.
