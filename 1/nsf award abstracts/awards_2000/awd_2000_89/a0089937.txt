Abstract    :
              ATM0089937

The investigators will build an advanced modular hased-array radar
              with pulse-to-pulse steering capability and with sufficient sensitivity to
              perform limited incoherent scatter measurements of electron density profiles
              with an integration time of one hour or less.  In particular, the investigators
              will build, calibrate and test a limited array of 24 x 24 antenna element
              units, each of which consists of a power amplifier, transmit/recieve circuitry,
              and control and monitoring electronics.

With this modular approach,
              individual elements are relatively inexpensive and the costs for an incremental
              system are determined by the number of antenna elements purchased. 
              Furthermore, the hghardware purchased at each phase can be used in building a
              bigger, more sensitive system.  This proposal builds on an earlier SRI proposal
              to build a small protype radar (ATM 9908951) and is the next logical step
              toward the construction of a fully functional relocatable upper atmospheric
              radar.
