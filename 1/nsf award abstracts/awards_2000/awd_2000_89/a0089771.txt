Gowdy
This award supports a third year of funding for John Gowdy and
              students from the Rensselaer Polytech Institute in a collaboration with Bernd
              Hansjuergens of the Department of Economic and Sociological Research at the
              Umweltforschungzentrum (UFZ) (Center for Environmental Research) in Leipzig,
              Germany.  The research funded by this award will make it possible for the
              German and U.S. researchers to share and compare research findings on two
              projects, one in the Hudson river watershed and one in the Elbe river
              watershed, each of which examines the connections between economic activity,
              land use changes, and their impact on the ecology and on sustainable
              development policies.  The end result will be a process that provides a
              rigorous analytical foundation for the pursuit of regional sustainability.  The
              opportunity this joint, collaborative research effort presents junior
              researchers is substantial, and the work done on this proposal will
              institutionalize the relationship between Renssealer and the UFZ Department of
              Economics and Sociological Research.
