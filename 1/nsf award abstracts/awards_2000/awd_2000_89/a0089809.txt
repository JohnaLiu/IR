Abstract    :
              0089809.  Earl Werner.  Interactions multiple species create and sustain natural
              communities.  Trophic cascades, species diversity, and community vulnerability
              to exotic invaders can be indirectly influenced by predator-prey interactions. 
              This project builds upon and extends a substantial database gathered on the
              interactions between odonate predators (Anax and Tramea), bullfrog and green
              frog tadpole prey, and the detritus/periphyton resources the tadpoles rely on. 
              Each species (e.g., predator, prey, parasite) plays a complex role in food
              webs, and exhibits behaviors that are influenced by interactions with the
              environment, and with other species in the community.  Understanding these
              interactions is one of the most fundamental objectives in ecology.  For
              example, competition between predators can affect the traits and behaviors of
              prey, such as prey foraging rates.  Such predator-mediated modifications of
              prey feeding behaviors can have short and long-term effects on food web
              dynamics.  To investigate these community interactions, this project will use
              field experiments and modeling to test the central theory that phenotypic
              variation in trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) can have profound and
              unexpected effects on the community. This project has strong theoretical and
              empirical components and blends modeling with hypothesis testing at multiple
              temporal and spatial scales.  Although this work is focused on how predators
              affect food webs, the underlying principles are applicable for investigating
              diverse types of functional relationships between species.
