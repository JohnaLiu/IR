This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              in software systems involves Beverly Sanders of the University of Florida and
              Dominique Mery of LORIA (Information Applications Laboratory), Universite Henry
              Poincare, Nancy, France.  The goal of this project is to explore the
              relationship between two known approaches to managing the complexity of
              software systems:  composition and refinement of components.  The US
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in compositional reasoning
              of software systems.  This is complemented by the French investigator's
              experience with feature interactions in telecommunication systems.  The project
              takes advantage of French expertise in theorem provers, model checkers and
              systems for abstract interpretation.  The project will also benefit from
              interaction with European industry which tends to be ahead of the US in
              utilization of formal approaches to system design.
 
This award represents
              the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for
              Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses
              for the US investigator.  The CNRS will support the visits of French
              researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental
              understanding of component based development of software systems and may lead
              to new understanding about the refinement and composition approach to managing
              complex and huge software systems.
