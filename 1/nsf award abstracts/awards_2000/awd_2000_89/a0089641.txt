This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              in chemistry involves Terry L. Gustafson, Ohio State University, Guy Buntinx
              and Olivier Pozat of the Universite des Sciences and Technologies de Lille,
              Lille, France. The objective of their collaboration is to conduct systematic
              investigations of photophysical properties of several related monomers,
              oligomers, segmented block co-polymers, and polymers in solution and as thin
              films.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in model
              oligomers and conducting polymers.  This is complemented by French expertise in
              the photophysics of molecular systems.  The project also takes advantage of
              complementary instrument methodologies. The US group will utilize ps
              time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and ns time-resolved infrared
              spectroscopy. The French group are experienced in fs and ns transient Raman
              spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy.
 
This award represents the US side
              of a joint proposal to NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US
              investigator and graduate student.  The CNRS will support the visits of French
              researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental
              understanding of electroluminescent conducting polymers, in particular, the
              conduction process, the control of radiative and non-radiative pathways, and
              the nature of interactions at the interfaces between polymers, and between a
              polymer and metal.
