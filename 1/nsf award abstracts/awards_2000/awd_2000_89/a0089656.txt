Ferguson and Patterson
	The North American genus Phlox (family
              Polemoniaceae), with about 64 species, has been the object of numerous
              ecological and evolutionary studies for many decades, but the taxonomy of the
              group has relied upon a now-50 year old monograph written before methods were
              available for clear, explicit analyses of phylogenetic relationships. Dr.
              Carolyn Ferguson at Kansas State University, with her colleague Dr. Robert
              Patterson at San Francisco State University, is studying molecular (DNA) and
              morphological patterns of variability in all the species of the genus, in order
              to construct a phylogenetic tree for the group, and thereby examine questions
              about evolution of pollination relationships, life history, geographic
              migration and ranges, and polyploidy and hybridization. Phlox is the largest
              genus in the family, and like all temperate genera in the family has its center
              of diversity in western North America. Efforts are underway to sample all of
              the species for molecular analyses of nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences and
              for restriction-enzyme mapping of the chloroplast genome, as sources of
              mutational characters for phylogenetic analysis. Field and herbarium studies
              will also add new data from morphology, and for re-examination of published
              descriptions. Hybridization has been reported in a number of species complexes
              in Phlox, and has been confirmed in the pilosa and glaberrima groups, and will
              be the focus of combined nuclear and chloroplast analyses. The combined
              molecular and morphological studies of the genus will facilitate writing of
              major taxonomic treatments for the species for the ongoing Flora of North
              America project, as an additional contribution.
