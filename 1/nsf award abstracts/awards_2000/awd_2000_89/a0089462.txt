Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Hungarian research project involving William Zajc of Columbia
              University and Tamas Csorgo of the Hungarian Institute for Particle and Nuclear
              Physics features collaborative work at the Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy Ion
              Collider (RHIC).  The goal is to unify experimental and theoretical efforts to
              discover and characterize quark-gluon plasma (QGP).  This pursuit involves the
              study of several important aspects of relativistic heavy-ion collisions,
              properties of hadrons in hot and dense matter, and signals of the QGP
              formation.  By building upon Hungarian expertise in measuring zero-degree
              spectra in heavy ion collisions, this international team intends to define an
              event characterization method common to four complementary RHIC experiments
              (BRAHMS, PHENIX, PHOBOS, and STAR).  Special attention will be directed toward
              interpreting complex signatures of quark deconfinement obtained by the PHENIX
              detector which Zajc heads. If successful, findings should prove the existence
              of a new state of matter, Quark-Gluon Plasma, with a full characterization of
              underlying physical phenomena. Results are expected to improve our basic
              understanding of the early universe and properties of massive stars.

This
              international project in nuclear theory fulfills the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and
              Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
