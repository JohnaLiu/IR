This award for U.S.-France collaboration between Frank
              Tabakin of the University of Pittsburgh and Bijan Saghai of the Centre d'Etudes
              de Saclay, French Atomic Energy Commission, involves the development of the
              coupled-channel approach to meson photoproduction.  The work is largely
              motivated by the development of intense photon and electron accelerators in the
              GeV region which has made possible experiments on the production of the
              elementary particle - mesons, pions, eta mesons, and kaons. The US and French
              investigators bring to this collaboration complementary expertise and will
              utilize new computer codes on the coupled channel approach in their analysis of
              experiments performed at Pittsburgh and Saclay.

This award represents the US
              side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for
              Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses
              for the US investigator.  CNRS will support the visits of French researcher to
              the United States.
