The 20th Texas Symposium on Relativistic
              Astrophysics and Cosmology will be held in Austin, Texas on December 10-15,
              2000. The Texas Symposium has gained the reputation as the major international
              meeting on topics in relativistic astrophysics, including the physics of
              compact objects, high energy cosmic rays, active galactic nuclei, the early
              universe, and observational cosmology. The meetings are held in alternate years
              and attract a large audience of theorists and experimenters working in
              astrophysics and related interdisciplinary areas, including particle and
              nuclear physics.  The symposium is sponsored by the Extragalactic Astronomy and
              Cosmology program at the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics
              and Space Administration, and the U.S. Department of Energy.
