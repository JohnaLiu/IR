This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              involves Michael F. Becker, John W. Keto, and Desiderio Kovar at the University
              of Texas, Austin, and Philippe Pernod and his group at the Ecole Centrale de
              Lille in Lille, France.  The objective of the research is the development of
              integrated actuators using nanoparticle based thick film materials and MEMS
              (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) theory and design.  Piezoelectric and
              magnetostrictive actuators will be produced by using supersonic jet deposition
              of nanoparticle derived films. The US group brings to this collaboration
              expertise in the preparation of special nanoparticle generation, materials
              design and testing of MEMS actuators.  This is complemented by the French
              group's expertise and experience in actuator manufacturing and materials.
              

This award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the
              French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel
              funds and living expenses for the US investigators and graduate students.  The
              CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to the United States. The
              collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of nanoparticle generation
              and the development and engineering process for new MEMS actuators.
