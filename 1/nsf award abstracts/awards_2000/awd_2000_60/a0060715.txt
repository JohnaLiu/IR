Abstract    :
              This  Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop
              metal matrix composite (MMC) and ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials with
              tailorable properties (thermal expansion, conductivity, stiffness, ductility,
              etc.).   An increase in properties for high volume reinforced (25-65 wt% SiC)
              aluminum materials using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) fluid bed coated
              powders and low cost consolidation techniques has been achieved.  Dramatic
              increases in flexure strength (30%) and modulus (40%) have been achieved with
              Al coated SiC powder and using low cost consolidation techniques.  A greater
              understanding of the effect of CVD coated powder and consolidation processing
              is required to fully understand the nano-engineered material being produced,
              and to develop even greater and distinctly different physical and mechanical
              properties.  In this Phase I project,  this fundamental understanding will be
              developed.  

The family of composites to be developed will be applied as
              cost-effective substitutes for titanium and beryllium materials for
              applications in electronic packaging, lightweight structures, aircraft engine
              and airframe components, and sporting goods.
