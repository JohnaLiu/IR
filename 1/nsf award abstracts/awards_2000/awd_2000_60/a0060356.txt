Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will produce a
              network application programmer's interface (API) specification and related
              implementation, referred to as the Autonomous Undersea Systems Network
              (AUSNET), for the distributed control of robotic and/or sensor systems in a low
              bandwidth, dynamic network environment.  AUSNET will allow expanded networking
              services specifically tailored to the unique acoustic environment.  The
              proposed effort builds upon emerging ad-hoc (self-forming, self-maintaining)
              network protocols.  Specifically, platform applications will gain access to
              network generated and propagated data, as well as enhanced control of the
              actual networking protocols. This will provide significant improvement both
              locally and network wide in the use of the acoustic band. It will also enable
              great adaptability to the harsh underwater environment.  The AUSNET effort will
              examine and demonstrate the potential to greatly enhance application level
              functionality by exploiting network capability and infrastructure in previously
              unexplored ways.  Phase I will result in a feasibility demonstration.  The
              Phase I development environment will be a simulation testbed, with a transition
              to a live operational environment planned for Phase II.

The market for tools
              that maximize the potential of flexible next-generation computer networks is
              significant and extends beyond the immediate oceanographic application into
              other domains.
