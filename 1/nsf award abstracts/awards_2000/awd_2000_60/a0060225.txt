Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate
              the proof-of-concept of innovative switchable holographic devices through
              material research.  The new holographic device, made from a novel liquid
              crystal and polymer composite material, consists of alternating polymer and
              liquid crystal planes without liquid crystal droplets and is expected to
              exhibit a higher performance than the prior technologies in terms of reflection
              efficiency, switching voltage, spectrum tuning flexibility, polarization
              flexibility, switching speed, and switching mode.  The Phase I effort will be
              focused on a special liquid crystal composite material development that leads
              to the construction of demo devices. In addition to the switchable Bragg
              reflection, the demonstration devices will exhibit tunable Bragg wavelength and
              multiple switching modes. 

The new holographic technology can be used to
              build polarizer, spectrum dispersion element, spectrum tunable mirror, optical
              switch, spectrum filter, beam splitter and combiner for optical
              telecommunication, display and photonics instrument such as spectrophotometer,
              lasers, optical imaging and detection systems.
