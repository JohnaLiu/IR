Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project describes an
              innovative approach to automating the integration of geographical data from
              multiple resources.  This process is commonly referred to as conflation. The
              most important aspect of the conflation process is feature matching.  Feature
              matching is the process of merging corresponding geographical features from
              various datasets.  Previous attempts at automatically solving this problem have
              only focused on the geometrical characteristics of geographical data; yet,
              there are other aspects of geographical data that should be considered:
              topological, nonspatial, and spatial. An improved approach to automating the
              feature matching process that utilizes these other aspects of geographical data
              is presented.

In the context of the growing use of geographical information
              systems (GIS), the need for tools to process, analyze and conflate geographical
              data is increasing.  Such tools will find application in the Department of
              Defense, in the drilling and mining industry, in the agriculture industry,  and
              by urban planners and GIS developers.
