Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I Project will develop new
              methods for continuous synthesis and purification of important carbon-based
              nanostructured materials, including fullerenes and endohedral
              metallofullerenes.  Due to their unique properties, structured carbon
              nanomaterials including fullerenes and nanotubes have become a large field of
              research that extends from chemistry, to physics and materials science. 
              Intense effort is directed in increasing the fabrication yield of these
              materials, since current synthesis methods have typical yields of less than
              0.5% for the more exotic and revolutionary nanomaterials.  Low yields, coupled
              with the current high cost of fabrication, has limited the development and
              commercialization of these important new materials.  Luna Innovations will
              develop new methods for continuous synthesis and purification of fullerenes and
              endohedral metallofullerenes based on recent advancements developed through
              joint research with our university research partners.  This approach will not
              only increase the quantity of these critical nanomaterials, but will in
              addition reduce manufacturing costs and usage of associated hazardous solvent
              materials.

Applications of these carbon nanostructures are predicted to
              revolutionize many areas of technology, including optical communications,
              high-strength composites, thermally-tailored structures for microelectronic and
              space applications, quantum computing, advanced medical diagnostics and
              treatments, and others.
