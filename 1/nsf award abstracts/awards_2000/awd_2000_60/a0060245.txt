Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
              development of a Solvated Metal Atom Dispersion (SMAD) synthesizer for high
              rate production and eventual commercial adoption of metal nanoparticle
              materials.  Several high value applications (from magnetic tapes to highly
              reactive catalytic materials) have been identified with corresponding
              significant commercial interest expressed, yet development of innovative,
              scalable processes has been a sizeable barrier for commercialization of these
              important nanotechnologies. During Phase I, several key technical parameters
              will be optimized including vaporization of multiple precursors, solvent
              recovery and recycling, as well as nanoparticle formation, separation and
              purification technologies.  At the completion of the Phase I Research, a
              conceptual design for a continuous scalable synthesizer will be
              developed.

Metallic, bimetallic, organometallic and encapsulated
              nanoparticles produced by the SMAD process meet a wide range of high value
              critical needs. Specifically, initial applications of the technology include
              superior catalysts, magnetic materials including information storage, improved
              transformer cores, radiation shield and coatings, and ferrofluids, as well as
              tracers for advanced systems.
