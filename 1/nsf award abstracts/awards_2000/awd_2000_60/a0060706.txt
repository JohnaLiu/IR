Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
              development of a new,
pulsed laser deposition based method to the
              combinatorial approach for generating nanoscale heterostructures. Nanoscale
              heterostructures, or "superlattices", have previously been shown to exhibit
              properties that are not expected from the known characteristics of the
              constituent materials.  However, a systematic study of such structures has been
              impossible due to the lack of a high-throughput synthesis method.  The proposed
              approach is based on a newly introduced, patented continuous-compositional
              spread technique and will be applicable to a wide variety of materials,
              including magnetic materials, piezoelectric materials, and optical
              materials.

The direct result of this program will be the availability of an
              automated apparatus for the growth of a rich variety of nanoscale
              heterostructures.  Since such an instrument is not currently available on the
              market, the company anticipates strong sales to university and industrial
              research laboratories.
