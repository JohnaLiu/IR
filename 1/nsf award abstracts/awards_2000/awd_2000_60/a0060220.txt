Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the
              problem of recovery
and recycle of strategic and critical metals. This project
              will determine the performance benefits of a nanocluster ion exchange media
              over traditional ion exchange resin, when used to recover strategic and
              critical metals, such as chromium, nickel and mercury.  The basic innovation is
              the deposition of an extremely thin film (2 nm) on nanoparticles, coupled with
              low-temperature consolidation of nanoparticles to form nanoclusters, and the
              use of chemically reactive coatings to remove metal ions from industrial
              process and waste streams. The integrated ion exchange (IIX) electrochemical
              process reactor, will allow a close coupling of the nanostructured clusters
              with charge modulated electric fields for enhanced treatment of industrial
              process and waste streams, and for in-situ regeneration of the nanostructured
              clusters.

The proposed process will facilitate cost-effective and selective
              separations assisted by electric fields, for
cost-effective recovery and
              recycle of strategic and critical metals from aqueous based processes, such
              as
in-process recycling in metal finishing operations, process and waste
              streams from chlor-alkali operations, and waste from dental and medical
              operations.
