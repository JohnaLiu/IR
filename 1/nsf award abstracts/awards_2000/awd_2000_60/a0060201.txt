Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will synthesize
              novel diquaternary amines with a high selectivity towards platinum group metals
              (PGMs) from acidic chloride media. State-of-the-art molecular modeling
              techniques will be utilized to predict structures likely to have a high
              affinity for the anions of interest.  The diquaternary amines are predicted to
              have a much greater selectivity than comparable monoquaternary amines due to
              increased steric interactions between the two nitrogens and the polyvalent ion
              of interest. These compounds will facilitate the separation and purification of
              high value metals, such as platinum, palladium and rhodium, from base metals
              using solvent extraction techniques.  The diquaternary amines will be
              synthesized, characterized and then evaluated in comparison with an existing
              monoquaternary amine (Aliquat 336) that has already been used in PGMs
              separation.  

Improved separation of PGMs will lead to a reduction in metal
              costs, facilitate recycling (e.g. auto exhaust catalysts) and thus minimize the
              dependence of the United States on imported PGM supplies.  These novel
              diquaternary amines will primarily have applications in precious metal
              refining.  Additionally, they could also be used in the separation and
              purification of actinides, such as plutonium, and in the preconcentration of
              trace levels of certain anions (e.g. chromate, arsenate) to aid in
              environmental analysis
