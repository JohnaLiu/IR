Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will spin off
              NSF-sponsored basic research on knowledge discovery at Carnegie Mellon
              University computer science department.  The result will be commercial software
              that can convey the contents of hundreds or thousands of documents on one
              computer screen with minimal clicking and scrolling.  This capability will
              enhance information needs as diverse as search, overviewing, and browsing, and
              alleviate the problem of information overload, which today confronts all
              retrievers of computer-based textual information.  The basic approach is a new
              form of conceptual clustering that emphasizes the human describability of the
              resulting document clusters.  The techniques combine classical hierarchical
              clustering with results from the PI's research on data-driven knowledge
              discovery, which focused on generating very concise and contrastive
              descriptions of a large number of classes (here, document clusters).  The
              overall goal is to replace the tedious long ranked list display of matching
              documents, which is nearly universal, but which forces users into repeated and
              inefficient clicking, backtracking, and scrolling.

The potential market
              opportunities include any domain where more than a few dozen relevant matches
              are returned for typical information queries, such as web searches, news,
              patents, scientific research abstracts, proprietary corporate information, and,
              generally the content delivered by the numerous vendors of specialized
              information services.
