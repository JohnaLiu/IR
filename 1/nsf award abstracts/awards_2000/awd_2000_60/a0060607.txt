Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project from GrammaTech
              aims to conduct research that will address fundamental problems facing
              developers of the software systems that comprise the Internet.  Problems with
              Internet systems such as software faults, security vulnerabilities and
              inefficiencies can lead to a lack of confidence in the medium and hinder its
              further development.  The tools used to construct these systems have so far
              mostly failed to help mitigate these problems because they were generally
              designed for more traditionally-constructed systems-- those that are mostly
              static and mostly single-threaded.  In contrast, Internet systems are typically
              highly dynamic and often involve concurrency.  A new breed of tools based on
              techniques that use static-semantic analysis of programs has recently emerged
              for static and sequential systems.  The research objective of this proposal is
              to extend and apply these techniques to the analysis of highly-dynamic
              concurrent systems.  The key technical challenges are to devise representations
              and methods that make these enhanced analyses accurate and tractable and to
              invent mechanisms for querying and organizing the results of the analyses.  The
              target will be the Java programming language.

The potential applications of
              this research include tools for program understanding, restructuring,
              parallelization, debugging, and testing.  The results of this research have
              commercial application in Interactive Development Environments (IDEs) for
              software construction, and in tools for all other phases of the software
              development process.
