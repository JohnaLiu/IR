Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              problem of imparting intrinsic oxidation resistance to a carbon-carbon
              composite when the matrix is derived from a carbonaceous precursor via
              pyrolysis.  The overall goal of the project is to assess the feasibility of
              using blends of pitch and pre-ceramic polymers as matrix precursors for
              carbon-carbon produced with a commercial processing cycle. The research
              objectives are two-fold:  (1) Determine the relationship between blend
              formulation and the resultant microstructure following processing, and (2)
              Compare the oxidation kinetics and room temperature mechanical behavior of
              composite samples produced in this manner.  Matrix precursors will be
              formulated by solution-blending pitches with silicon-containing compounds and
              then subjecting the blends to a conventional carbon-carbon processing cycle. 
              The resultant chars are expected to exhibit unique two-phase microstructures
              with intriguing micro- and nano-scale features, and to impart oxidation
              resistance without deleterious impact on mechanical properties. 

The first
              commercial application of this method is expected to be used in lieu of baked
              coatings in carbon-carbon aircraft brakes. If successful, the technique may
              become an enabling technology for the use of carbon-carbon composites in a
              broad range of high temperature structural applications.
