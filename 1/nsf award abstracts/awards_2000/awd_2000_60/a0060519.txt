Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project, proposes to
              synthesize and consolidate nanocrystalline powders of yttrium aluminum garnet
              (YAG) for optical window applications.  Optical window materials must meet
              extreme service requirements because they control the beam effectiveness and
              power output characteristics of laser/optical devices.  Single crystal YAG is
              an ideal material for laser optics because of its excellent opto-mechanical
              properties.  It is optically transparent in the wavelength region 200 to1200 nm
              (from ultraviolet to near-infrared) and from 2.5 to 6.0um (infrared). 
              Unfortunately, single crystal YAG is costly and technically difficult to
              produce because of its high melting point (1970oC).  One economically viable
              alternative is to fabricate transparent YAG ceramics using fine-grained
              polycrystalline powders. The field of nanomaterials offers excellent
              opportunities to fabricate optically transparent materials from polycrystalline
              powder, with opto-mechanical properties similar to single crystals.
The use of
              polycrystalline YAG as a window material will revolutionize the laser industry
              by significantly reducing window cost. 

Transparent YAG has many
              applications in the laser and optics industries.  It can be used as a window in
              high performance laser modules, wavefront analysis systems, beam collimation
              testers, spectrometers, laser power/energy meters, industrial turnkey laser
              systems for coding, 3D optical surface mapping, micro-machining, laser Doppler
              anemometers and imaging spectrographs.  Lower cost laser
systems will find
              more applications, especially in personal computers CD-ROMs with laser diodes,
              laser printers, and modems, which require optical isolation.
