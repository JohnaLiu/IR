Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              the feasibility of developing an innovative manufacturing process for
              prototyping and batch manufacturing high-aspect ratio microelectromechanical
              systems (MEMS) and related microparts and microstructures. The goal is to
              replace an electrodeposition-based micromachining technique, requiring the use
              of a $10-20 million synchrotron (the so-called LIGA process) with an innovative
              extrusion-like process performed in an automated desktop machine selling for
              $250,000 or less. By supplying the MEMS industry with capital equipment for the
              manufacture of LIGA-type microstructures at a cost two orders of magnitude
              lower, this project could greatly accelerate the commercialization of MEMS and
              other microscale devices, and make the U.S. more competitive in this
              rapidly-growing global industry. If successful, the resulting technology could
              also significantly reduce time-to market for new products, fabricate much
              taller structures than are possible with LIGA, and provide better control over
              the uniformity of material properties.

Commerical applications cover many
              highly-miniaturized sensors and actuators in a variety of industries, allowing
              reduced cost, weight, size, and power consumption.
