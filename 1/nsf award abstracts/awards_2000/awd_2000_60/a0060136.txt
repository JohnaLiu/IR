Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project  will support the
              current trend in developing nanophase materials.  This is spirited by an
              increasing need for nanometer-scale structures in a variety of applications. 
              It is clear that to achieve unique mechanical, physical, chemical, and
              biomedical properties, it is necessary to develop novel synthesis routes by
              which an entirely new nanostructure can be developed.  When the thickness of
              the metal down to nano-meters, the metal/dielectric multilayer coating exhibits
              metallic conductivity and dielectric transparency.  The periodic nature of the
              metal/dielectric lattice causes the light to propagate through the metal layers
              with extremely low loss.  The most unique feature of the metallic optical
              filter is the ability to have a single pass band and block all other radiation
              from static fields to soft X-rays.  This remarkable property is a result of the
              highly dispersive nature of metals.

This research program will develop a
              nano-engineered powder: bilayer coated nanopowder.  This powder composses three
              functionalities: highly transparent, highly conductive and a broad band
              radiation blocking from static fields to soft X-rays.  Development of such
              unique nanostructures would not only benefit the specific industrial
              applications, such as panel displace and anti-static/anti-reflection (ASAR)
              coating for lenses and CRT, but also the electronic industry, in general.
