Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  addresses a
              major ancillary service, that of optimizing generator reactive power in support
              of system voltage profile.  The rated reactive power of generators are based on
              their field, stator, and end-iron heating limits. Their operating ranges are
              further limited by the max/min voltage limits of generator terminal, plant
              auxiliary motors, the system bus, and generator's protective and control
              systems.  These voltage limits are interrelated by the tap positions on the
              transformers directly connected to the generator.  The objective is to
              integrate an optimal power flow model with the generator reactive capability
              model for optimal selections of generator transformer taps.  It is anticipated
              that the research would result in an analytical tool which would help the
              industry achieve the desired lag/lead reactive powers in support of system
              voltage profile.  

The proposed research leads to development of a power
              flow program that would include the actual generator reactive capability
              limits.  Such a model would determine optimal tap settings to allow an
              increased supply of reactive power during transfer of large blocks of power and
              an increased absorption of reactive power during light-load condition, both in
              support of system voltage profile.
