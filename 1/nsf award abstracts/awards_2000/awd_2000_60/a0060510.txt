Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              technologies to generate curved meshes over general three-dimensional domains
              that are appropriate for high-order finite element analysis.  A current
              stumbling block to the wide adoption of high-order finite element techniques is
              the lack of automatic means to generate appropriate curved meshes. This project
              will develop a new and innovative procedure for the effective generation of
              these types of meshes.

The commercial application of this research is the
              integration of CAD technologies with advanced automated simulation techniques
              to be used within engineering design processes. These tools will reduce the
              time and costs associated with performing engineering analysis during design
              and increase the accuracy of the predictions obtained.
