Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will conduct
              research to replace current environmentally damaging metal pretreatment
              processes with an environmentally benign process.  In the approach the metal
              surface is etched then coated with a sub-micron film of plasma polymerized
              SiO2. Current metal pretreatment processes for painting and adhesive bonding
              perform well, but generate tremendous volumes of wastes, including hexavalent
              chromium and various inorganic acids. To obtain performance superior to the
              current state-of-the-art wet chemical surface treatments, the surface chemistry
              and morphology of the plasma polymerized films need to be tailored for specific
              interactions with the adhesive. Effects of variables including substrate
              chemistry, monomer chemistry, and ion kinetic energy on surface chemistry and
              morphology of plasma polymers will be determined. Then, the effect of the
              resulting structure on the strength and durability of adhesive joints will be
              determined. 

By combining in-situ analytical techniques with accelerated
              aging and mechanical testing of adhesive specimens, a superior, environmentally
              benign process based on plasma polymerization will be developed and
              commercialized. These primers will have well understood morphologies and
              surface compositions tailored to the adhesive chemistry through control of the
              deposition conditions and/or chemical derivitization of the plasma polymer
              surface.
