Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
              entirely new form of machine vision technology for process control during the
              manufacture of precision metal components.  The technology will be based on a
              two-dimensional array of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensor elements capable
              of providing high resolution three-dimensional images of metallic components in
              real-time. Previous research with individual GMR sensor elements with
              dimensions of 10 microns has demonstrated detection capabilities with
              sensitivities up to 60 dB better than conventional eddy-current sensors at a
              lower per unit cost A densely packed, two-dimensional GMR sensor array,
              combined with a variable frequency, uniform magnetic field generator, will
              produce high resolution, three-dimensional spatial information for complex
              metallic parts as they are produced using a rugged, non-contacting sensor
              system.  The data from these images will provide on-line feedback information
              for process control, quality assurance, and safety protocols during the
              manufacturing process.  The data will also be valuable for the design of more
              effective manufacturing processes. The successful development of GMR material
              fabrication techniques and sensors will provide the unique capabilities
              required to develop a magnetic field sensor array for machine vision and
              automated manufacturing.  

The proposed technology will find markets in
              manufacturing, quality assurance (QA), and process development.  It will be
              used for rapid imaging and on-line analysis of parts used in aerospace,
              automotive, transportation, construction, and other industries.
