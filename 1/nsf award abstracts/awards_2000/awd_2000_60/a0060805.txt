Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              a new class of highly disordered materials that possess unique chemical,
              physical, and high temperature properties.  The disorder appears to be stable
              over a range of temperatures, raising the possibility of use as high
              temperature ceramic materials with unique properties.  Based on preliminary
              evaluation, it appears that the materials may be useful as coatings for many
              applications.  The materials are synthesized using specially prepared precursor
              solutions that allow for intimate molecular mixing.  The decomposition behavior
              of the precursor to form this class of inorganic materials appears to be
              important.  The proposed work involves determination of some basic properties
              of the materials, processing of the material in bulk and coating forms, and
              modeling/simulation experiments to understand the nature and stability of the
              disorder.

High temperature applications including ceramic matrix composites,
              protective coatings on metals and ceramics, and thermal insulation.
