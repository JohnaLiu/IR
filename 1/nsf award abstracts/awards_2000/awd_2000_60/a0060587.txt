Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I proposal will enable the
              development of commercial products baced on the advanced technology of Language
              Computer Corporation (LCC).  The technology involves Question Answering (Q/A). 
               Several research objectives are identified to make this work. The first one is
              to develop a viable commercial product out of the technology by redesigning the
              key components of the system: indexing, search engine, and the answer
              extraction module.  The second objective is to study and design a scalable,
              distributed Q/A system architecture capable of serving a large number of users
              simultaneously.  The third objective is to extract user profile information for
              the purpose of increasing the service quality and revenues. The final objective
              is to evaluate the performance of the products in the laboratory environment,
              as well as in a small scale Application Service Provider (ASP) model with real
              users of two beta customers.

The proposed suite of three products is based
              on leading edge research on question answering performed by the LCC management
              team.  The significance of this work is that by developing robust, scalable
              question answering products, it takes the search engine technology a step
              closer to providing users with quality information that is accurate and
              concise.
