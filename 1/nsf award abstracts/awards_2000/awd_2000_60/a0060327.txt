Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              an innovative photo-curable "cure on demand" room temperature preceramic
              polymer approach for the fabrication of high yield silicon nitride (Si3N4) and
              Si3N4/SiC ceramics.  No photo-curable preceramic polymer to silicon nitride or
              any other nitride ceramic has ever been previously demonstrated.  The proof of
              concept will be demonstrated by synthesizing and subsequently
              photo-cross-linking poly(ethynyl)silizane (PESZ) prior to pyrolysis.  This is
              expected to result in a low-dielectric, low creep, high ceramic yield matrix or
              coating with wide applications.  This represents a new core enabling technology
              with potential for microelectronics, thermal management, and high temperature
              structural applications. 

Specifically, the unique combination of high
              strength, high temperature stability, high thermal conductivity, and unusual
              dielectric properties of silicon nitride lend themselves to unique applications
              that include hybrid circuit substrates for microwave electronics, hypersonic
              interceptor nose cones, and antennas. The photo-curability permits the eventual
              photolithographic patterning of both carbide and nitride ceramics.
