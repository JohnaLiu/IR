Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a chemical
              solution to stop the formation of Nitrogen Dioxide in the surface coal mining
              industry where cast blasting is used. The creation of Nitrogen Dioxide is the
              result of deflagration or burning of the Ammonium Nitrate in the Ammonium
              Nitrate Fuel Oil (ANFO) blasting agent. This chemical pollution avoidance
              technology prevents deflagration by utilizing a technique known as shaped
              charge detonation. The shaped charge produces a jet of supersonic heat and
              pressure that initiates the reaction between the Ammonium Nitrate and the fuel
              oil to achieve near-instantaneous hydrodynamic velocity. The economic
              advantages of employing the new CastMax detonation system are two fold:  the
              primary purpose is to eliminate NOx emissions and the attendant regulatory
              costs (monitoring, reporting, etc.) that would be applied; the secondary
              purpose is to maximize the energy efficiency of the blast. 

Ceasing the NOx
              formation will result in the recovery of $25,000,000 of lost blasting
              efficiency in US
surface coal mining for 2001. Not only will energy costs be
              recovered, but also the use of this technology will forestall the costs
              associated with litigation, legislation and regulation about how to solve the
              Nitrogen Dioxide problem.
