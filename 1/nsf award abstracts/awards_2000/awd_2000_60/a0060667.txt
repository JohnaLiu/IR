Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Program (SBIR) Phase I involving Proton
              Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells offers a unique opportunity to create zero
              and ultra-low emission vehicles.  While current nickel or noble metal catalysts
              used in the reformer of PEM fuel cells are effective for the steam reforming,
              they are very sensitive to sulfur poisoning and also deactivate by coke
              deposition.  This research will effort will develop a new, sulfur-tolerant
              catalyst with low coking and low cost for gasoline steam reforming.  TDA
              Research, Inc. (TDA) has identified a novel sulfur-tolerant catalyst for
              gasoline steam reforming to generate hydrogen for PEM fuel cells.  In this
              program TDA will prepare and evaluate this catalyst, using an existing
              automated steam reforming reaction system to test our catalyst.  The Phase I
              work will include an engineering analysis to assess the effect of the catalyst
              on sulfur poisoning, coke deposition and processing costs as well as the cost
              of producing the catalyst.  The catalytic activity of TDA's catalyst will be
              measured in the presence and absence of H2S.

A successful project will
              result in the production of sulfur tolerant and coking resistant catalysts for
              the fuel processor of PEM fuel cells.  PEM fuel cells are suited for
              automobiles applications where quick startup is required, and are the primary
              candidates for use in light-duty vehicles.  They will create zero and ultra-low
              emission vehicles.
