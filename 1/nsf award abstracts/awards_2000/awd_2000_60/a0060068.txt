Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              novel mechanical means of reducing the skin friction of surfaces immersed in
              water. The concept to be analyzed and tested shows promise of reducing skin
              friction by 30 percent. The passive device would be fabricated in sheets and
              installed on existing immersed surfaces. While the concept is straightforward
              and conceptually simple, a major portion of the Phase I effort will be devoted
              to a proof of performance test using a simple gravity powered test rig, which
              will measure skin friction reductions achieved with the proposed device.

If
              successful, the technology would be capable of reducing skin friction drag of
              moving objects significantly. Reducing the skin friction by 30 percent on a
              typical tanker crossing a 5,000 mile ocean at 20 knots would save over 156,000
              gallons of fuel (one way). Other potential applications include pump inlets and
              pipes, long-haul tractor trailer trucks, and high-speed trains. Military
              applications are multifold and include torpedoes and vehicles where high speed
              is a requirement.
