Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the
              feasibility of using a newly invented novel materials joining process based on
              electromagnetic theory as a reliable and economic method to weld tubular
              structures.  The project will conduct research and engineering that will
              address the following critical technical hurdles for the commercial
              implementation and dissemination of the new welding technology: (1) A
              comprehensive understanding and characterization of the process; (2) An
              effective methodology for design and optimization of the system apparatus and
              welding procedure; (3) Special weld head design and manufacturing to allow for
              quick loading and unloading the workpiece in the production environment; (4)
              Industrial system prototyping for an automated welding system that can be
              integrated in automotive assembly line, and (5) Process and performance
              specifications. 

The successful development of such technology would
              revolutionize the assembly process of the hydroformed tubular structures in
              automotive chassis and space frame applications.  It will also promote the
              hybrid automotive body structure design that uses both aluminums and steels,
              and enable joining of different materials such as titanium to superalloys for
              aerospace and electronic applications. A new multi-million dollar/year
              specialty tube joining process is expected in about 5 years.
