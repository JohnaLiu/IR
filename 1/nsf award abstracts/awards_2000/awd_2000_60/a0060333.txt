Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a scanning
              automultiscopic 3-D visualization system. Visual information gathering and
              interpretation can be significantly improved by presenting information in three
              dimensions.  Current 3-D systems have very limited field-of-view or require
              intrusive headgear with head tracking to emulate look-around, and suffer from
              inconsistencies between binocular convergence and eye accommodation. Physical
              Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a new class of 3-D displays based on
              proprietary liquid crystal scanner panels that time-sequentially project a
              large number of perspective images over a wide field-of-view into the view
              space in front of the display. POC will investigate the feasibility of the
              proposed concept through simulation, analysis, design, and experimentation,
              culminating in a proof-of-concept demonstration.

The proposed
              automultiscopic 3-D visualization system, without glasses or head tracking
              equipment, will produce a correct 3-D image without convergence and
              accommodation inconsistencies, thus eliminating eye strain that has recently
              been identified as a potential cause of eye damage. The proposed research
              effort will result in a novel kind of high performance 3-D visualization system
              that overcomes the limitations of current stereoscopic display technologies. 
              The 3-D system will be used for visualization of multidimensional scientific
              and medical data, for 3-D design, training and education of government and
              civilian personnel in a cooperative 3-D environment, and for telepresence and
              teleoperation
