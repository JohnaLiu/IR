Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project deals with the
              science of fermentation which to date has not been integrated into teaching
              laboratory activities.  While molecular biology is an important aspect of
              biotechnology, thus far other aspects of biotechnology such as fermentation
              technology have not been incorporated into science curricula.  The following
              are the main objectives of this project:  (1) to research and design classroom
              laboratory bioreactors; (2) to interface bioinformatics and fermentation
              technology;    (3) to develop problem-based fermentation experiments; and  (4)
              to assess the pedagogy of fermentation resources to be researched.  The
              intention is not to duplicate existing microbiology activities, but rather to
              develop fermentation experiments that fit the proposed bioreactor strategy. 
              Equally important, the experiments to be researched will provide real world
              "beginning to end" biological problems instead of reagents out of
              bottles.

There is a significant business opportunity since currently no
              equivalent commercially available fermentation bioreactors are available for
              science education.  There is research grade equipment, but such equipment is
              not affordable for the education market.  The company's customers are high
              school teachers and undergraduate college faculty.  These customers are also
              potential customers for fermentation bioreactors and related products.  The
              proposed fermentation product would broaden the current offerings and increase
              sales.
