Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              a new approach to optimize thin film photovoltaic device fabrication. The
              requirements for the efficient conversion of solar radiation to light are a
              challenge to modern solid state physics and engineering.  The task is to
              provide conversion elements, which are efficient, cheap, and long-lived in
              order to compete with sources of electric energy which exploit non-regenerative
              resources of our planet.  Organic solid state devices offer several
advantages
              which make them highly interesting for this area of scientific research and
              commercial development: (1) tunability of the absorption properties, (2) low
              cost of production due to the ease of fabrication and low costs for the raw
              materials, (3) mechanical flexibility.  One could produce 10,000 m2 of active
              solar panels with a film thickness of the organic active layer of 100 nm using
              only 1 kg of organic material.  Luna proposes to use an interdiffusion process
              to fabricate thin film, organic photovoltaic
devices that are characterized
              electrically and optically during the fabrication step.  This unprecedented,
              new approach allows one to optimize device performance during fabrication and
              to resolve the kinetics of the chemical and physical processes which take place
              during the interdiffusion of two species of organic molecules.

Thin film
              photodiodes and solar cells have immediate application in various commercial
              areas for  inexpensive, large area, flexible optical detection and energy
              conversion devices in optical communications, household appliances, and
              commercial electronics.
