Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              low temperature joining compound for structural alumina.  The paste will rely
              on the low melting point of alumina preceramic materials to effectively wet the
              joining surfaces and alumina filler, thus forming a dense joint with
              characteristics similar to the joined ceramics.  The program will investigate
              three different filled paste preparations: a) a dissolved processor paste, b) a
              suspended precursor paste, and c) a precursor salt mix with a lowered melting
              point paste.  This technology will make possible the production of complex
              alumina structures from simple geometric alumina pieces, which have been
              previously densified. Innovations in this area will make the realization of
              complicated structural ceramics more cost effective in production.  The paste
              will decompose to alumina, and will be densified at temperatures lower than
              that needed to sinter alumina. 

The technology to be developed under this
              project will find wide application in the structural ceramics market.  Low
              temperature joining technologies are needed to increase the complexity of
              structures that can be economically produced from these materials.
