Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
              enabling innovation that directly converts infrared (IR) radiation from heated
              sources using nanowire antennas and nanometer scale monolithically integrated
              diodes.  This program will create IR-collecting modules using very inexpensive
              metal materials and electrochemical processing.  The low efficiency, expensive
              materials, and the need to chemically tailor compositions to efficiently couple
              to different emitters have substantially limited commercialization of
              thermophotovoltaic modules to niche applications.  The feasibility of
              electrochemically formed IR-collecting modules will be demonstrated.  Once
              demonstrated,  antennas will be engineered for maximum collection
              efficiency.

The applications vary from low temperature portable power packs
              to the generation of electricity from high temperature nuclear and conventional
              heat sources.  In addition, the creation of a non-biased, room temperature,
              quantum confinement structure has the potential to revolutionize IR detector
              technology.
