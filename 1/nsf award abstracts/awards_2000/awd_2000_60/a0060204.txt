Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project would develop
              membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) utilizing alternative polymer electrolyte
              membranes (PEMs) for high-temperature fuel cell operation.  Under this project,
              GESC, LLC will develop and test MEAs utilizing polymer films.  Polymer
              electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have received increased attention for
              supplying power for Next Generation Vehicles due to their high power densities,
              high efficiency, low environmental impact, ease of assembly and quiet
              operation.  A barrier to PEMFC technology is poisoning of the anode catalyst by
              CO, a by-product of the reformer.  CO poisoning is disfavored at temperatures
              above 100 degrees C, however current PEMs are prohibited from operating at
              these temperatures as the membrane loses water necessary for ion conductivity.
              Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFCs) can operate at elevated temperatures
              (140-200 degrees C) but are limited due to difficulty in retaining the
              phosphoric acid.  A great need then, exists for a PEMFC membrane that can
              operate at high temperatures.  The goal of this project would be to develop
              MEAs that incorporate proton transporting phosphoric acid functionalities
              directly into the PEM through covalent bonds, greatly extending the life of the
              PEMFC by eliminating the loss of electrolyte.

Fuel cells that operate on
              reformate feed are being developed for both Next Generation Vehicles and
              stationary power applications. The potential market for a PEMFC that can
              operate with increased tolerance to CO concentrations in the anode feed is very
              large.  Such a system would not only capture a large sector of this emerging
              market, but would increase the range of applications for fuel cell systems.
