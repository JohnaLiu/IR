Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              the synthesis and production of a new thermoplastic hydrogel (TPH).  The TPH
              will be made by the modification of poly-2-ethyloxazoline, a commercially
              available polymer.  The new TPH will have the properties of a crosslinked
              system when cold but will flow when heated.  This property is unique for
              hydrogels, typically covalently crosslinked systems, which are limited in their
              use due to process restrictions.  The TPH will have the ability to be extruded
              or molded by the end user into virtually any form, allowing the manufacture of
              new products that cannot be made today.  The water soluble polymer is an ideal
              candidate due to its high thermal stability.  This project will describe two
              routes for attaching graft polymers onto the polymer backbone.  Both routes are
              viable from a high volume production standpoint.

Applications of the TPH
              would include: medical products (catheters, contact lenses, and synthetic wound
              dressings), adhesives, recyclable super absorbents, ink jet printer media, and
              a variety of agricultural materials.
