Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project from PowerWorld
              Corporation addresses the problem faced by the electric power industry in
              visualizing vast quantities of power system data.  The entry of new players
              into the electricity industry has resulted in a large new demand for tools to
              help them understand and analyze power systems.  Areas such as system
              operations that have traditionally been the domain of highly trained engineers
              now need to be understood by a broader spectrum of professionals.  The
              restructuring of the industry has resulted in new terms, transaction methods,
              and technical calculations to facilitate the many different types of
              transactions needed to realize promised economies and profits.  The purpose of
              the proposed work is the development of an interactive 3D environment tailored
              to the needs of power system analysts.  This work will include development of a
              prototype interactive environment and methods for visualizing power system
              data.

The market niche that PowerWorld Corporation is attempting to exploit
              is the development of high-quality, yet extremely user-friendly power system
              visualization software to meet the expanded needs for power system
              visualization that are a result of industry restructuring.
