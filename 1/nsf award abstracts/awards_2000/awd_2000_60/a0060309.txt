Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new high pressure/high temperature (HPHT) cell for conventional hot pressing
              units, which will be capable of achieving very high static pressures and
              temperatures in relatively large working volumes. This new unit, which is
              called a 'supercell', will enable pressures up to 30 GPa and temperatures up to
              ~5000C in a working volume of >>1 mm3. In contrast, a conventional diamond
              anvil cell can attain pressures of ~30 GPa in a working volume of only ~1 mm3,
              with temperatures limited to about 400C. Thus, the supercell will have
              capabilities for processing materials that reach beyond those of today's
              systems. Utilizing the significant pressure/temperature/volume range of the
              supercell, it should be possible to obtain the very high pressure and very high
              temperature needed for crystallization of diamond from liquid carbon, and make
              possible the study of unknown regions of the carbon state (phase) diagram. HPHT
              crystallization of diamond from liquid carbon provides an opportunity to
              produce nanocrystalline, microcrystalline, or monocrystalline diamond,
              depending on the cooling rate from the liquid state, as well as opening new
              possibilities for doping diamond with boron and/or nitrogen.

This project,
              if successful, will enable manufacture of pure and doped nanocrystalline,
              microcrystalline and monocrystalline diamonds, and will facilitate the
              production of advanced anvils for the diamond industry as well as for
              production of inserts for drill bits. The technology also has important
              potential for university laboratories.
