Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to
              investigate the physical and mechanical properties of Polymer Silicate Layered
              Nanocomposites (PSLN) as applied to dental materials. A specific material
              system is chosen that optimizes key properties including compressive, flexural
              and tensile strength, hardness and reduction of polymerization shrinkage while
              maintaining the critical working and handling characteristics of the material.
              The quantum effects realized through the novel mechanistic dispersion of the
              nano-sized and geometrically ideal filler will lead to dramatic property
              enhancement of the composite affecting the durability and longevity of the
              dental restoration. Feasibility of this application of PSLN technology will be
              investigated through a series of experiments with subsequent
characterization
              by x-ray diffraction and TEM analysis. Due to a high failure rate attributed to
              lack of strength, marginal leakage and technique sensitivity, methacrylate
              based dental composites have not been universally accepted as a replacement for
              amalgams. 

Preliminary findings and data from other industrial applications
              support the idea that PSLN technology provides superior property enhancement
              enabling remarkable potential for further acceptance of dental composites. This
              research project addresses the development of an enhanced dental composite
              specifically for use as core build-up material and provides future avenues for
              improvements to all dental composites, including anterior, posterior and
              flowable composites.
