Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish
              the electron emission behavior of aligned nanotubes coated conformal coating of
              nanocrystalline diamond.  Carbon nanotubes and nanocrystalline diamond has
              recently attracted attention due to their promising electronic and structure
              properties.  Due to the aligned structure and electrical properties of
              nanotubes and the negative electron affinity of the wide band gap of diamond it
              is expected that diamond coated aligned nanotubes could be ideal
materials for
              highly efficient electron sources.  It is proposed to produce aligned nanotubes
              with varied growth density, develop and coat with conformal coating of
              nanocrystalline diamond, and to characterize these novel materials for electron
              emission behavior. These results will be compared to existing and developmental
              emitters.  The proposed approach if successful can be applied to produce large
              flat panel displays
economically.

Flat panel displays are becoming
              increasingly important in today's society.  With the demand for portability in
              such applications as laptop computers, automobiles navigation system, cellular
              telephones, pagers, etc., the market for flat panel displays is growing
              rapidly. A low cost scaleable technology of efficient emitter urgently needed. 
              Aligned nanotubes coated with diamond can the breakthrough needed.
