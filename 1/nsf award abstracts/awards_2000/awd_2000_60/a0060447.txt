Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to use giant
              magnetoresistance (GMR) magnetic sensors and eddy current techniques to detect
              flaws in metallic components under insulative coatings. Innovations and
              improvements in surface treatments such as coatings and sprayings including
              thermal barrier coatings are useless unless degradation, wear, corrosion and
              oxidization due to thermal and mechanical stresses can be monitored under these
              surface treatments. Conditional monitoring using GMR sensors has the following
              advantages:  (1) Refinement of present sensor technology will enable
              the
manufacture of eddy current sensors of very high sensitivity thereby
              increasing the permissible lift-off. (2) Unlike ultrasonic methods, magnetic
              fields are not significantly affected by the presence of electrical insulating
              coatings.  (3) The directional sensitivity of GMR based sensors allows
              detection of flaws near edges where cracks are more likely to initiate.

This
              project will prove the feasibility of using GMR sensors and eddy current
              techniques to detect flaws under coatings. High sensitivity GMR sensors will
              allow the design of small, easily maneuvered, portable NDE units which can be
              used for structure monitoring, surveillance, critical component monitoring and
              equipment preparedness.
