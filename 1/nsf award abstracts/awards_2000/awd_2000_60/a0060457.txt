Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new
              automatic methods for designing, configuring, and reconfiguring communications
              networks.  New communications technologies, like Wave Division Multiplexing, or
              fully mobile wireless networks and new communications services with Quality of
              Service requirements all require fast, reliable methods for reconfiguring
              network topologies, defining fixed and mobile equipment locations, selecting
              from available media, and providing and configuring required interface
              equipment.  The resulting networks must be able to recover from temporary
              traffic congestion, equipment outages, or interference.  This project uses
              innovative Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques to solve these problems and
              provide end users with reliable cost-effective methods for network design,
              management, and reconfiguration.

The GA based decision aid will shorten
              planning cycles and increase reliability in designing, managing, expanding, and
              adding new services on current multi-site commercial and military networks.  It
              will also provide reliable, effective support for configuring military,
              commercial, or disaster relief wireless networks using mobile switching
              equipment.  It will also shorten the time and expense required for Internet
              Service Providers to upgrade their networks for new users and services.  The
              methods will also apply to fault diagnosis, network expansion, vulnerability
              analysis, and performance tuning in existing networks and extend the
              capabilities of current network management tools.  These application areas
              represent growing multi-billion dollar markets.
