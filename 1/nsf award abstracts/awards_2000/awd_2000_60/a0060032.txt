Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              incorporation of a carbon dioxide/hydrogen separating membrane unit into steam
              reformer pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) hydrogen plants.  This membrane unit
              will increase the amount of hydrogen produced by a reformer PSA plant by
              10-20%.  The goals of the project are to optimize and produce a new type of
              composite membrane in bench-scale quantities and to fabricate bench-scale
              modules containing this membrane.  The modules will be evaluated with model
              feed gas mixtures representative of those generated in reformer PSA plants. 
              The experimental data obtained will be incorporated into a computer simulation
              of the process to determine the technical and commercial potential of the
              process.  Based on this work, the overall feasibility and advantages of
              applying the technology to reformer PSA operations will be assessed.  The
              initial target of the carbon dioxide/hydrogen membrane process to be developed
              is PSA tail gas.  

More than 300 large steam reformer PSA plants are
              operating in U.S. refineries and petrochemical plants.  All of these plants can
              potentially be retrofitted with this new membrane technology. Longer-term, 
              several other large potential applications such as hydrogen production for fuel
              cells exist.
