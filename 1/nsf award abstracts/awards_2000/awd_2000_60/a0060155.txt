Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of an innovative process for copper metallization and
              planarization of semiconductor scale features.  In contrast to geometric
              leveling or true leveling in the presence of levelers and brighteners, the
              proposed electrochemical deposition process is based on charge or Faradaic
              mediated leveling.  The current copper metallization process utilizes a
              difficult to control plating bath containing levelers and brighteners and
              generates between 30 and 50 liters of waste slurry for each 8-inch wafer
              processed.  The proposed charge modulated electrochemical deposition process
              will operate in a simple, easily controlled plating bath and will eliminate or
              substantially reduce the waste and cost of the current
              chemical/mechanical-processing step.  During the Phase I program, the
              theoretical basis for the Faradaic mediated leveling process will be
              established and validated using state-of-the-art ULSI wafers.

It is
              anticipated that the Faradaic mediated leveling process will eliminate or
              substantially reduce (i.e., by greater than 85%) the copper waste slurry and
              provide substantial cost savings relevant to the state-of-the-art copper
              metallization processes in the semiconductor industry
