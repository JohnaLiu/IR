Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              novel microchip chemical analyzer that incorporates a new nanomaterial that
              performs both separation and detection of small quantities of chemicals and
              biochemicals.  This will be accomplished by developing the required chemistry
              and processing to coat microchannels (20 x 50 microns) with a proprietary
              material that contains silver nanoparticles capable of supporting plasmon
              surface modes and generating surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra.  Preliminary
              studies suggest this new nanomaterial will provide continuous, reproducible,
              quantitative, reversible, and rapid chemical analysis to part per trillion
              concentrations in nanoliter sample volumes.  Phase I will prove feasibility by
              preparing microchip chemical analyzers and testing their SER-activity. Testing
              will include several test chemicals (p-aminobenzoic acid, phenyl acetylene,
              etc.), pharmaceuticals (amobarbital, barbital, and phenylbarbital), and the
              four DNA bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine).
 
The commercial
              market applications for this technology include biotechnology (DNA sequencing,
              protein analysis), medicine (metabolite analysis), and pharmaceutical
              (high-throughput molecular structure identification).
