Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at
              developing cryogenic magnetostrictors that have high mechanical strength and
              can be fabricated more cost-effectively than existing materials.  The potential
              for the use of cryogenic magnetostrictive materials for a variety of
              applications such as adaptive optics, robotics, automation and linear motors is
              great.  Several cryogenic magnetostrictive materials have been discovered
              recently exhibiting high strain and excellent mechanical properties.  These
              materials, consisting of an alloy of terbium dysprosium and zinc, are not
              commercially available but can be fabricated in small quantities.  The process
              is complex and expensive because of the mismatches in the melting temperatures
              of the constituents.  The focus of this research effort is to develop compounds
              of alloying materials that more closely match each other thereby eliminating a
              time consuming and costly step of the fabrication.  The result of this work
              will be a low-cost scalable manufacturing process for magnetostrictive
              materials.

If successful, this project will make low-cost cryogenic
              magnetostrictive materials and devices available in the marketplace for
              precision positioning of optics, vibration control, semiconductor fabrication,
              valves and pumps, etc.
