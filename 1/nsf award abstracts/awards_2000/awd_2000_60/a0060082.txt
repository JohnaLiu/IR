Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              process for growing ferroelectric, polycrystalline barium titinate (BaTiO3)
              thin-films, by anodic oxidation of polycrystalline titanium, in a barium
              hydroxide (BaOH2) electrolyte. By utilizing this novel, low-cost method of
              ferroelectric formation, it will be possible to obtain thin, uniform
              ferroelectric films at relatively low temperatures (less than 100C) that
              exhibit dielectric constants around 200. 

Though films of this nature find
              applications in various other electrical devices, the company will utilize this
              novel technology, if successful, for integral thin-film decoupling capacitors
              due to the significant advantages offered over traditional discrete decoupling
              capacitors. Another potential application is optical waveguides. Ferroelectric
              thin films have applications in thin-film passive components as well as optical
              waveguides.
