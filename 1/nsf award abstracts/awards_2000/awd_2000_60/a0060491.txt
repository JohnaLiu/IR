Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks make high
              performance vapor-grown carbon fiber (VGCF) into a commercially viable product
              by using improved catalysis to increase the growth yield by an order of
              magnitude.  This material has been used to create composites with record
              setting thermal properties in a variety of matrix materials, while reducing
              weight.  However, the cost of this material is high and the quantities that can
              be produced are far too low to allow its widespread commercial exploitation. 
              The production rate is limited by a very low efficiency of the catalyst that
              nucleates fiber growth.  Work under this program will improve the method of
              catalyst dispersion, thereby optimizing the size distribution of catalyst
              particles, and leading to an increased nucleation rate.  Improved catalyst
              efficiency will result in proportionate increases in production rates and
              decreases in costs.

Markets for VGCF reinforced composites include fields
              that need improved, lighter weight, thermal management systems, such as space
              and aviation, high power electronics, consumer electronics, and power
              generation.  For many applications, the thermal performance of VGCF reinforced
              composites will be enabling.  For others, it will allow passive cooling to
              replace active systems, thereby reducing cost and increasing reliability.
