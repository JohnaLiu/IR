Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates a
              new approach for fabrication of microscale combustors for hydrocarbon fuels.
              Novel technology for microchannel products will be combined with a microreactor
              concept to fabricate a highly efficient microscale integrated superalloy
              combustor/evaporator, which uses methane combustion for heating and/or boiling
              working fluid. The innovative fabrication technique enables dramatic cost
              reduction in comparison with the existing technologies. The technical objective
              is to demonstrate that the proposed combustors can produce at least 30 watts of
              thermal energy per square centimeter of heat transfer area and efficiently
              transfer that energy to a cooling fluid. This is approximately 20 times higher
              than the heat transfer rate of conventional water heaters. The proposed
              approach provides solutions to many materials problems as well as the
              opportunity to miniaturize numerous components and devices that are currently
              in existence. 

Potential commercial applications of the research include
              lightweight, safe and high performance microcombustors for microturbines,
              man-portable microheaters for cold climates, man portable cooling microsystems
              for hot climates, on-board fuel processors for hydrogen generation, distributed
              space conditioning of buildings, etc.
