Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will utilize
              known chemistry and economical materials to create imide-based anions
              containing greater charge delocalization and ligands for anion solvation. The
              solvent levels needed for high conductivity for safe, high rate (10 degree C)
              operation of lithium ion cells will be determined.  Acceptable densities in
              small cells create safety concerns in large capacity batteries, particularly at
              high load levels, because solvent-lithium reactivity, heat, and solvent
              volatility can generate explosive or pyrotechnic mixtures.  Better electrolyte
              conductivity and stability are needed for safe high power operation. The
              lithium prototypical salt is not as stable or conductive as desired and is less
              stable than imide-based anions.  Solid-polymer-based electrolytes reduce the
              danger of catastrophic battery failure, but they have lower power densities due
              to lower conductivity compared to liquid electrolytes.  A new class of
              imide-based lithium salts containing covalently attached ligands to solvate
              anions and enable Li+ (lithium ion) dissociation and conductivity, using little
              or no molecular solvent will be developed.

Large, safe, high rate,
              rechargeable lithium ion batteries are needed for a variety of applications,
              including electric vehicle propulsion, aircraft and space vehicles, and
              communications equipment. Improved consumer electronic products, such as
              portable telephones, computers, cameras, and power tools, could also be a
              market for this proposed technology.
