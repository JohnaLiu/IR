Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              research ways to increase accessibility and utilization of census microdata in
              secondary school mathematics classrooms.  Historically, microdata published by
              the Census Bureau as part of each decennial census has rarely been used in
              schools for lack of access and lack of software tools to handle it.  The
              Internet and the availability of software tools such as KCP Technologies'
              Fathom tm  change this situation dramatically.  In collaboration with the
              Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) project at the University of
              Minnesota, this project will develop streamlined interfaces with which students
              can use the World Wide Web to gather data from one or more Public Use Microdata
              Areas (PUMAs) in the country from any of the census back through 1850. 
              Research into modifications to the Fathom software will aim to develop new and
              better ways to gather data from the Internet, to create enriched data
              structures, and to design other functionality particularly well-suited to
              working with microdata.  New curriculum and professional development materials
              created in this project will provide a means for teachers to begin using census
              microdata in mathematics and statistics classrooms.
  
The proposed research
              will lead to licensing opportunities for the software technology already
              embodied in Fathom software, web-based technology for gathering and analyzing
              microdata, curriculum products to be sold to schools, and an increased market
              for Fathom in education.
