Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              demand for structurally efficient damage-tolerant engineering materials.  New
              and ingenious methods are required to generate novel, application-specific
              materials, particularly for the service temperatures between 400C and 650C. 
              Metal matrix composites (MMCs), characterized by a metallic alloy matrix
              (typically aluminum or titanium) reinforced with a second phase ceramic
              (typically carbides or borides) have emerged as promising candidates offering
              increased specific strength and modulus, at ambient and elevated temperature at
              the expense of ductility.  The opportunity exists to create novel
              Non-Equilibrium Metallic Composites (NMCs) using metallic second phase
              reinforcing constituents, thereby combining the load sharing advantages of MMCs
              while maintaining the practical service advantages of a totally metallic
              material.  This new class of materials can be created by powder metallurgy,
              using solid-state diffusion to generate the non- equilibrium structures.  Based
              upon promising preliminary investigations with the titanium- tungsten system,
              tungsten particle reinforced titanium alloy test bars will be produced for
              critical microstructural, physical and mechanical property evaluation in this
              program.  It is anticipated that increased specific strength for intermediate
              service temperature can be achieved without sacrifice in toughness.

The
              Non-Equilibrium Metallic Composite materials being investigated in this program
              could be applied to four major market areas: industrial transportation
              (engine/automotive), biomedical and aerospace/defense where tailored
              compositions could offer significant competitive advantage.
