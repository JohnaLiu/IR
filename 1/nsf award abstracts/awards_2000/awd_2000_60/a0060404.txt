Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to an
              economical wet chemical method for depositing hard and scratch resistant
              coatings on transparent polymer substrates.  The proposed program, when
              successfully carried out, will solve the ubiquitous problem of transparent
              polymer surfaces being scratched and worn.  Solution methods, which are easily
              scalable, have been used to develop polymer-oxide nanoparticle (hybrid)
              transparent coatings on transparent polymers.  Such materials lack high
              hardness values, which can be dramatically increased by incorporating coarse
              oxide ceramic particles in the hybrid matrix.  Based on this innovative
              approach to maintain transparency even with addition of a significant volume
              fraction of coarse particles (> 0.25 microns) to a hybrid matrix, transparent
              coatings will be developed on polycarbonate and acrylic substrates with
              excellent wear and chemical resistance.  Solution methods of forming polymer
              nanocomposites coatings are far more economical compared to vacuum/gas phase
              processing (e.g., plasma polymerization), but its use has been restricted
              because of the poor abrasion resistance of these coatings.

This novel
              approach will lead to exceptional wear, scratch and chemical resistance
              coatings, which will have a wide range of applications in the automotive,
              aerospace and other industries.
