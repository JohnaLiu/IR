Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create
              nanofiber reinforced thermoplastics as an economical composite for use in
              structural components. Carbon nanofibers have superior and highly touted
              intrinsic mechanical properties to contribute to reinforcement of composites.
              However, their extremely small size, and thus high surface to volume ratio,
              makes attainment of a strong interface crucial to transferring the intrinsic
              nanofiber properties to the composite as a whole. Starting from a knowledge
              base developed under a prior NIST ATP program, this project will further
              develop  methods of nanofiber surface modification and characterization to
              solve the interface problem, promote solid adhesion between the nanofibers and
              thermoplastic matrix materials, and create and test the first practical
              nanofiber reinforced composits for structural materials.

Nanofiber
              reinforced thermoplastics will result in lighter, less expensive structural
              composites for applications in automobiles, sporting goods and aerospace
              vehicles. The use of thermoplastics will reduce material costs relative to
              thermoset composites, and permit economical injection molding processes to be
              used. Also, electrostatic painting processes will be enabled, reducing the
              emission of solvents and other unwanted effluents.
