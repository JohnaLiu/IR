Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the
              development of a neutral, high
flux/fluence nitrogen atom beam source for
              application to the high rate growth of III-V nitride
semiconducting materials
              over large areas.  The proposed source is based on Physical Sciences
              Inc.'s
(PSI's) proprietary MID-JET technology.  This technology employs an
              electrode-less discharge
contained by vortex flow, rather than a dielectric
              tube commonly used in traditional sources.  The
discharge is formed at 1 atm
              which results in efficient Ion recombination and a charge-free
              beam.
Previously, high flux, high fluence oxygen and fluorine atom beams have
              been demonstrated using a
MID-JET with a gas temperature of ~ 3000 K. However,
              to produce a nitrogen atom beam, the basic
configuration of the MID-JET must
              be changed to obtain the > 5000 K temperatures required to
dissociate
              nitrogen. In Phase I, PSI will examine at least two new configurations via
              modeling, select
one, and fabricate and test an experimental source for
              nitrogen.  Techniques for combining the nitrogen
beam with a gallium source
              will be examined via detailed numerical modeling.  If successful, PSI
              will
demonstrate a charge-free nitrogen atom source with a fluence of about 10
              21 atoms/s, 2 to 3 orders of
magnitude higher than that generated by currently
              available sources.

This project will develop a charge-free, high
              flux/fluence nitrogen atom beam for the growth of III-V
nitride materials
              which can replace existing plasma-based tools. The source can allow higher
              growth
rates over larger areas of high quality material with application to
              the fabrication of high power/high
temperature semiconductor devices and blue
              illumination sources (including those for flat panel
displays).
