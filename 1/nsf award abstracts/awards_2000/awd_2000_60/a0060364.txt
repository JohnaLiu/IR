Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
              a diamond coating technology for steel that has the chipping and spalling
              resistance needed for commercial applications. Friction and wear between
              rolling, sliding, and cutting surfaces causes lost efficiency, reduced service
              life, and lost capital. For example, the loss of a bearing while drilling a
              deep oil well can cost $40,000 an hour in lost production. Diamond, which has a
              hardness that is twice that of cubic boron nitride (CBN) and four times that of
              silicon carbide (SiC), cannot be used in these commercial applications due to
              its poor spalling resistance. The innovation set forth in this proposal seeks
              to develop interfaces between the steel and diamond that will resist spalling
              of the film. Advanced computing techniques will be used to identify and
              evaluate the best prospects for a revolutionary
              substrate(steel)-interface-coating(diamond) system (Phase I deliverables). 
              

The commercialization of a chip-resistant diamond coating will facilitate
              the development of various advanced bearing and wear products including rolling
              and sliding bearings, engine parts, cutting tools, and biomedical devices.
