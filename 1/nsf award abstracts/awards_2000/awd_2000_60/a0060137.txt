Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to save
              semiconductor wafers from being deeply scratched by unchecked large errant
              particles in chemical mechanical planarizing or polishing (CMP) slurries. CMP
              has become the method of choice for restoring the surface trueness of wafers at
              all stages of its manufacture. No method currently exists that can implement a
              CMP-safe slurry at the point of use. The proposed novel technology of acoustic
              coaxing induced microcavitation (ACIM) is a means to constructively control
              acoustic microcavitation and direct its high intensity energy implosions at
              specific particle sites. ACIM will achieve both the detection and destruction
              of the stray large particles and render the entire slurry CMP-safe at the point
              of use.

The ACIM slurry monitor-comminuter would be the first fully in-line,
              real-time, point of use method for detecting stray large particles and
              agglomerates and for reducing them to a nano-fine state. The rapidly growing
              CMP industry presents a well-developed market for this
environmentally
              friendly ACIM tool.
