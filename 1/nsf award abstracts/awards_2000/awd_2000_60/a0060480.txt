Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              the viability of a new manufacturing Supply Chain Management System (SCMS)
              representing an innovation in enterprise resources planning (ERP) supply chain
              management that:  (1) Is more effective than existing supply-chain management
              software paradigms;  (2) Incorporates many of the "lean manufacturing"
              principles; and (3) Is more available to smaller manufacturing companies than
              existing systems in that it can be delivered via the worldwide Web.  The result
              would be more effective inventory management, production planning, and
              production control resulting in greater customer responsiveness, lower
              inventory levels, and higher utilization of critical resources.  By delivering
              over the worldwide web with a free trial period followed by a "pay-per-use"
              protocol, smaller companies can make use of the same powerful scheduling tools
              that are used by large companies.  The concept is a considered to be a better
              fit for real manufacturing systems than existing ERP approaches.

If
              successful, the results would enable U.S. manufacturing companies to be better
              suited to compete in the new web-based marketplace that takes low cost and high
              quality as given, leaving customer service as the key aspect for distinction. 
              Such companies will be able to deliver customized products to customers with
              almost zero lead-time, thereby enhancing their position in an increasingly
              competitive global environment.
