Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              need for a non-vacuum deposition approach for contact layers in CdTe solar
              cells.  While sputtering is at present successfully employed, the objective of
              this project is the development of a nanoparticle ink that could be used to
              print submicron thick Te thin films.  To date, Te inks produce non-uniform
              coatings owing to particle agglomeration.  The research objective of this
              project is the formulation of a Te ink composed of dispersed, nonagglomerated
              Te particles with diameter less than 50 nm.  The efficacy of this ink will be
              demonstrated by fabrication of CdTe solar cells as follows.  First, the Te ink
              will be sprayed onto the CdTe layer of a solar cell heterostructure.  Then,
              this green body will be subjected to a thermal treatment.  Finally, the solar
              cell will be finished by deposition of an opaque electrode.  Characterization
              will be performed on the ink, the sprayed layers, and the finished CdTe
              devices. 

 If successfully developed, it is anticipated that this research
              would be translated to a production-sized (i.e., 100 megawatt) CdTe solar cell
              facility through the industrial subcontractor of this project.
