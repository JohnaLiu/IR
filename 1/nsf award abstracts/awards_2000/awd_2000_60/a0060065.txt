Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              the feasibility of a novel hybrid three dimensional (3D) imaging and animation
              technique for custom-design and custom-fit eyeglass frames, based on the 3D
              imaging technology recently developed by Genex Technologies, Inc (GTI). The 3D
              camera is able to acquire both 2D and 3D face images of a customer in a
              snapshot. The digital 3D face model is then converted and immersed into a
              virtual simulation environment, dubbed as the "VirtualFit(TM)", that allows
              customers to select a large number of eyeglass frames in a variety of styles,
              sizes and colors to try them on the realistic 3D face model of themselves. The
              VirtualFit(TM) also performs digital measurement of all critical dimensions
              from the 3D-face model and offers recommendations to assist the custom-fitting
              process. The 3D model can also be transferred over Internet to frame
              manufacturers for custom-made frames. Low-cost 3D-camera hardware prototype and
              virtual simulation software will be developed and tested in Phase 1. The fully
              functional prototype system will be developed in Phase 2 and field tests will
              be performed in retail store to obtain feedback for improvement. 

Enormous
              commercial potential virtually guarantees the deployment of the VirtualFit
              system as a widespread E-Commerce tool for optical spectacle industry.  The
              VirtualFit technology can be applied to many other applications, such as
              apparel fitting, shoe fitting, hairstyle selection, furniture selection, and
              ergonomic product design.
