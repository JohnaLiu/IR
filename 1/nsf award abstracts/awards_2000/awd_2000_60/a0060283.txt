Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              state-of-the-art
computational models to accurately simulate the next
              generation of plasma-etch tools for SiO2 and low-k dielectric materials. 
              Modeling tools necessary to address these challenges are not currently
              available, and will be developed by two companies specializing in chamber scale
              multi-dimensional and surface reaction chemistry simulations.  The Phase I
              effort will focus on plasma sheath model (unified plasma sheath model of
              Riley/Bose) implementation, software integration and development of new ion
              assisted reaction formalism. Feasibility of the proposed integrated simulator
              will be demonstrated utilizing simple C2F6 plasma mechanism of CFDRC and
              complex C2F6 plasma etch mechanism developed by SEMATECH. 

The commercial
              availability of the proposed capability will allow process engineers to design
              better processes and identify equipment/process deficiencies before they are
              performed on a R&D or production scale. Implementation of the proposed
              computational innovation will produce major impact on technology readiness, and
              affordability through better process chamber designs and higher throughput.
