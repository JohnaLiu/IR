Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              development of Advanced Carbon Composite Transmission Conductors for
              application in high voltage transmission grid systems.  This technology will
              enable greater electric power transmission capacity to be realized by
              facilitating operation at higher temperatures as compared with conventional
              metallic conductors.  The demand for electric power in North America and Europe
              has risen in proportion with economic growth.  Utilities worldwide are seeking
              new methods to transport more power though overhead transmission corridors. 
              This demand is not anticipated to diminish as the technological age advances. 
              Environmental, regulatory and economic constraints have constrained the
              installation of new transmission line corridors that are needed to meet this
              demand. An alternative is to upgrade existing transmission corridors to
              accommodate increased power flow.  In order to address the increasing power
              demands of industrialized nations advanced conductors offer the potential to
              enable distribution grids the capacity to meet this challenge. 

This project
              will address the requirements for utilities worldwide to facilitate increased
              power flow through existing overhead high voltage transmission corridors.
