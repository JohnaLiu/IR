Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  will develop
              materials to help science learners use mathematics more effectively.  The
              project provides a plan for creating new curriculum materials for the science
              classroom.  These materials will use Fathom tm, a new data analysis software
              package originally developed for mathematics. Also,  enhancements for the
              software to make it more appropriate in science will be designed and
              implemented. Too often, science students use less-sophisticated
              mathematics--for example, computing means or proportions--than they use in
              parallel math classes.  Fathom software, coupled with data sources such as the
              web and probeware, can be used-to help students bring the mathematics they are
              learning to bear on science.  Students' understanding of science concepts will
              improve, and they will see more connections between their science and
              mathematics learning.  With three successful sample lessons, Epistemological
              Engineering will be poised to create additional materials and to implement
              further software enhancements.

The proposed research will lead to
              significant enhancements to Fathom software and open the door to creating
              curriculum materials in science education using tools previously available only
              to math educators.  Epistemological Engineering will benefit both from opening
              the science market for Fathom and from the sale of the science curriculum
              materials that the firm will publish.
