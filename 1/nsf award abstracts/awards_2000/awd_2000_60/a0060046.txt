Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will combine
              electron beam curing and dynamic beam control technology to create equipment
              for electron beam rapid prototyping/manufacturing. The unique advantage of this
              technique is that it offers 'ultra-high' speeds in the range of 5 - 20
              cc/second.  If successful, the resulting technology can produce one liter
              sized, large, complex plastic parts in times of order 1 minute. This increase
              in speed will dramatically reduce the cost of rapid prototyping so that this
              technique can be used in small and medium production run manufacturing.  In
              addition to increasing speed, electron beam curing can use a much wider range
              of materials than optical curing because the electrons stimulate polymerization
              directly, without requiring photoinitiators as part of the cured compound .
              Electron beams can also be used to integrate metals and carbon fibers into the
              rapid prototyped part. In Phase I,  crude parts will be produced using this
              technique, and develop plans for a complete Phase II system that will focus on
              the large variety of available electron beam curable plastics.

Applications
              for the technology include production of parts for small lot production such as
              electronic enclosures, custom mechanical equipment or medical equipment.
