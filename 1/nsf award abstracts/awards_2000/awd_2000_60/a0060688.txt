Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              Newton-Krylov based Computational Fluid Dynamics flow solver for simulating
              reacting flows that must account for finite rate chemistry. Sub-models will be
              included for describing the finite rate chemistry with global, skeletal and
              reduced mechanisms. The non-linear solver strategy will use a matrix-free
              Newton-Krylov method and will include high quality preconditioners constructed
              from application specific data, adaptive forcing terms and mesh sequencing for
              problem initialization.  The Phase I project will demonstrate proof of concept
              for the non-linear solver strategy.  Simulations of NOx formation in a furnace
              will be used to evaluate the improved
computational efficiency. The Phase II
              project will focus on creating a solver for production level use. The Phase II
              product will use the best techniques developed in Phase I and in addition will
              include capabilities for local adaptive grid refinement and parallel
              computing.

The final product will find commercial application by engineers
              and scientists in the combustion, chemical process and waste incineration
              industries that need to perform detailed analysis of complex chemically
              reacting flows in a cost effective manner.
