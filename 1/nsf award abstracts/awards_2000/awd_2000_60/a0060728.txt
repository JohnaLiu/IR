Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address
              central problems of information retrieval(IR) and  the human/computer
              interface.  QuantumFind wishes to develop a dynamic, graphically presented
              information space in which users can immediately visualize multiple aspects of
              large information sets. QuantumFind will build a pioneering new IR platform
              that contains the following:
(1)  A collaborative filtering systems based on
              analysis of users' search paths through data, which will allow users to benefit
              from other's experience; (2) Integrated Ostensive Modeling systems which will
              match the results of collaborative path analysis and other relevancy measures
              to user's current information needs; and 
(3) A dynamic user interface which
              integrates these measures, allowing users to immediately see and explore
              multiple 'relevance paths'.

QuantumFind's product will dramatically reduce
              the time spent in locating, retrieving and browsing documents, and
              significantly increase users' recall of document contents.  The need for better
              information search tools is widely recognized, and the potential market covers
              almost every industry.
