Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
              new class of low threshold, high efficiency laser array for telecommunication
              and optical integration applications using  nanomaterial fabrication
              technology.  By incorporating photonic crystals into nanochannel-hosted dye
              lasers, a novel microlaser array will be developed.  Laser active dye materials
              have been proven to emit coherently in microcavities of nanopore host
              microcrystals.  By incorporating the photonic crystal concept in the microlaser
              cavity design, more efficient lasing is anticipated for the embedded dye
              microlasers.  Success in developing a microlaser array will lead to flexible
              and novel products for telecommunication and optical circuits. The Phase I
              program will investigate the fabrication of nanochannel materials, characterize
              the nanochannel materials, and determine how to incorporate the photonic
              crystal into the nanochannel materials. 

Since microlaser arrays can be
              readily incorporated into silicon-based photonic devices, there are immediate
              commercial applications to the telecommunication industry.  There is also long
              term potential for microlaser arrays in display, laser printing and all optical
              integrated circuits.
