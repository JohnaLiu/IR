Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop user-friendly component software for classical econometric estimation
              and inference based on simulation methods.  In the last decade, different
              simulation-based methods have been developed to tackle complex
              economic/statistical models which cannot be estimated by conventional methods
              such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and generalized method of moments
              (GMM).  Although these simulation-based estimators have desirable theoretical
              properties, they have remained as research topics in academia and have not
              become useful tools for practitioners because of the lack of user-friendly
              software.  This project provides a plan to study three leading applications for
              simulation-based methods: multinomial probit model for cross-sectional data,
              multiperiod multinomial probit model for panel data, and stochastic volatility
              models for time series data.  MathSoft will use extensive Monte Carlo
              experiments to explore finite sample properties of various aspects of
              estimation and inference, with an aim of improving and stabilizing the current
              algorithms.  The user-friendly component software will be developed using the
              state-of-art JavaBean technology and provide intuitive graphical user
              interface.  The JavaBeans will also be supplied as S-PLUS functions to gain a
              broad user base.

The software will help worldwide economists and
              practitioners in other fields such as financial industry, social sciences, and
              biotechnology to conduct flexible and extensible model estimation and
              inference.
