Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
              development of nanocomposite materials that are capable of producing
              photostimulated luminescence (PSL) and the demonstration of their ability to do
              so at room temperature for durations that would support practical applications.
               Successful production of PSL with such materials would suggest that this
              technology could be used to create optical storage media for X-ray and other
              imaging techniques.  Nanoparticle-based PSL optical storage systems would
              provide images with higher resolution at lower levels of production energy.
              Because of the extensive use of X-ray and similar technologies in the medical
              industry, manufacturing, security field, inspection and non-destructive testing
              processes, and many other applications, the proposed approach would offer
              substantial reductions in costs, complexity, hazards, and other negative
              aspects of the use of these processes.

This technology will be applicable to
              virtually all X-ray processes and many other imaging and information storage
              techniques.
