Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project  will combine the
              Internet, electronic libraries, and a new machine learning technique that
              simulates human understanding of text to produce an independent learning and
              problem solving environment for individuals and groups.  Using Latent Semantic
              Analysis (LSA), Auto-autodidact (autodidact: a self taught person) first learns
              the vocabulary and concepts of a topic by automatic training on textbooks. 
              Then, as students study and write, and groups discuss and plan, it will
              continuously evaluate what they know and what they do not know, find relevant
              information anywhere in the electronic library, and connect participants with
              complementary needs and knowledge.  Auto autodidact capitalize s on the
              motivational power of peer interaction, the instant availability of enormous
              textual resources, and the possibility of sharing individual knowledge over
              time and space.  Auto autodidact will integrate LSA with Knowledge Forum, a
              state-of-the-art facilitator for distributed knowledge-building discussion, and
              newly available electronic libraries, to provide continuous embedded
              assessment, tutorial dialogue, and meaning-based information insertion. It will
              be unique in its ability to construct a learning environment for a new domain
              in a matter of days. 

Knowledge Analysis Technologies proffers a learning
              environment technology that has potential value for science and engineering
              education throughout the life cycle and for research and design organizations. 
              The firm plans to commercialize the technology directly and through publishers,
              distance education providers, and educational testing organizations.
