Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will
              significantly increase the energy density and reduce the manufacturing cost of
              ultracapacitors for NGV applications.  Cell voltage constraints presently limit
              the energy density and increase the number of cells required for high voltage
              ultracapacitors. The composition of porous carbon electrode materials will be
              modified to adjust the open circuit potential, thereby increasing the cell
              voltage.  Anodically stable electrolytes will be investigated to
              further
increase cell voltage.  The objective is to increase cell voltage to
              3.6 V versus 2.5 V typical for present commercial carbon-based ultracapacitors.
               Since energy density scales with 2 V, 3.6 V cells would more than double the
              energy density.  This increase would also reduce manufacturing cost by reducing
              the number of cells in high voltage devices by >30%.  Prototype capacitor cells
              will be prepared and evaluated to determine the cell voltage window.  Extended
              charge/discharge and constant potential measurements will be made to assure
              that the increased cell voltage is sustained.

Ultracapacitors complement or
              replace batteries in applications where weight, peak power, and battery life
              are key factors.  Commercial applications include cellular phones, power
              conditioning (UPS),
electromechanical actuators, and conventional or next
              generation vehicles.
