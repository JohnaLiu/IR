Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop low
              friction, wear resistant coatings of the Al-Cu-Fe quasicrystalline (QC) phase. 
              QC coatings appear to be especially suited for anti-seize, anti-fretting
              applications for both fixed interfaces subjected to vibration or long duration
              exposures to hostile ambients that include intermittent vibration.  These
              qualities of QC films are believed to be a result of the unusually low surface
              energies for these structures.  The overall program objective is to demonstrate
              the low friction and wear resistive properties of dense, high quality,
              magnetron sputtered Al-Cu-Fe icosahedral, quasicrystalline thin films. 
              Magnetron sputtering of QC films will be conducted from thermal shock resistant
              targets, manufactured from a new proprietary technique developed by TA&T.
              Coefficient of Friction, wear resistance, surface energy, phase content, and
              stoichiometry of the films will be measured and correlated with DSC
              measurements and sputtering and annealing parameters.  

The ability of QC
              coatings to resist chemical changes, fretting and sliding wear while
              maintaining low surface energy (non-adhesive) characteristics could make them
              ideal coatings for a variety of commercial and military applications.
