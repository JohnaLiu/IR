Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
              new class of engineered zeolite catalysts for the petrochemical and refining
              industry.  A looming reformulated gasoline boom is driving the development of
              solid-acid catalysts routes to alkylates. The intent is to replace sulfuric and
              hydrofluoric acids with safer and more environmentally benign solid-acid
              catalysts in the 60-million tons/year alkylates market.  Although zeolites have
              been tried as a potential candidate, they deactivate rapidly on stream. The
              deactivation is mainly due to the formation of 'coke' deposits that plug up
              pore mouth openings and block the active sites.  The novel zeolite catalyst
              uses smart structure-directing agents to create highly ordered micro and
              macro-pores. The larger pores provide efficient access and quick diffusion of
              reagents to the micro-porous system, while the smaller pores can offer
              high-surface area and size selectivity; thus specific catalytic and sieving
              functions.  Engineered zeolite catalysts will be synthesized, characterized and
              tested for activity and stability as part of the Phase I research. It is
              expected that the unique pore architecture will reduce intra-pore diffusive
              barriers leading to higher product selectivity and a significantly longer
              catalyst life compared to conventional zeolitic systems.

This new class of
              engineered zeolites can be used effectively as a solid-acid catalyst for fast
              liquid phase reactions such as the production of iso-octanes, cumene and EB.
