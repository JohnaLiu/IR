Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of an advanced technology for the direct formation and
              deposition of nanocomposite polymer coatings and films.  The technology
              encompasses the use of novel thermal spray techniques that are solventless and
              that may also be developed for use in directly forming functionally-graded
              nanocomposite materials and near-net-shape thermoplastic nanocomposites.  The
              objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of using an advanced thermal spray
              process to directly melt-blend and form nanocomposite coatings and films. 
              Experimental work will be conducted to spray coat nanomaterials onto a
              substrate, followed by an evaluation of the sprayed material properties for
              suitability as an advanced nanocomposite coating material.  The proposed
              technology addresses the global interest in nanostructured polymeric materials
              that have significantly improved performance properties over conventional
              polymeric materials. 

This technology has direct application in the powder
              coating industry, where thermoset and thermoplastic materials are sprayed for a
              broad range of applications, which include coatings on automobiles, appliance
              coatings, architectural coatings to a broad range of general metal finishing
              uses.
