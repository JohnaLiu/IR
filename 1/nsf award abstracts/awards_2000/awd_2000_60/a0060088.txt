Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              low-cost composite proton exchange membrane (PEM) capable of high temperature
              operation (>150 degrees C) with excellent chemical resistance and good thermal
              and dimensional stability suitable for advanced fuel cells in next generation
              vehicles (NGV).  The key to this new composite membrane is a high temperature,
              high strength, chemically resistant membrane support structure fabricated from
              Foster-Miller's patented porous single crystal alumina material.  Tailored
              porosity structures have been fabricated with interconnected passages
              suitable
for infusion with a suitable ion conducting polymer (ICP) for high
              strength PEM's.  This new PEM will address the serious cost/performance
              problems associated with current perfluorinated membranes.  Fuel cells based on
              this new technology will achieve power density greater than 0.2 W/cm2. 
              Membrane cost should eventually approach the $80/m2 level necessary to promote
              development of the NGV. Commercial scale up of the porous single crystal
              alumina manufacturing is already underway with a commercial processor of
              ceramics.  During Phase I small composite Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEA's)
              will be
fabricated, characterized and electrically tested for high temperature
              conditions (150 degrees C) and peroxide stability. Phase II will optimize the
              composite PEM with fabrication and testing of MEA fuel cell
              stacks.

Commercial applications for the proposed advanced composite PEM
              include cost efficient fuel cells for automotive, utility and space/military
              applications. As a potentially key enabling technology for the automotive (NGV)
              application, the market potential is very large. Utility uses include
              communications, computers (laptop) and remote power generation. Space and
              military include manned space missions (space station), shipboard power,
              battery replacements and portable/mobile field generating units.
