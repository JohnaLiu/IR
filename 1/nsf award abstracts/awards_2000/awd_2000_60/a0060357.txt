Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              and evaluate a new class of video compression algorithms specifically designed
              for digital CCTV (closed circuit TV) systems.  As the market for surveillance
              video systems has been increasingly becoming digital,"compression has become a
              critical enabling technology.  Current systems employ conservative, standard,
              and generic compression algorithms that often result in jerky object motion and
              waste of memory and network bandwidth.  This project will investigate a new
              class of compression algorithm that can significantly improve picture quality
              at bit-rates lower than or comparable to those in current systems/products.
              This is done by exploiting the special characteristics of surveillance video
              and by adopting a segmentation model. The result will be a prototype software
              module that can be installed in digital CCTV systems as their compression
              units.

This technology can be used in video surveillance systems for
              monitoring banks, airports, government and corporate buildings.
