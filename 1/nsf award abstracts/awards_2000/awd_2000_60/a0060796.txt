Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will generate an
              Internet based system that will connect large groups of users with similar
              agricultural commodity interest.  ISCA Tech will start with a system that will
              allow growers to easily collect and manage pest-monitoring data for rapid and
              precise decision-making.  ISCA Tech proposes to integrate into this single
              user-friendly system many nascent and some established techniques that
              facilitate monitoring and rapid data management.  Handheld-collected data will
              be incorporated into an Internet hosted database where the tools of data
              management and query reside.  Internet access will connect users into area-wide
              monitoring programs that are independent of location.  It will also greatly
              increase the speed of data processing and report generation, and democratize
              the access of data management tools, such as GIS, to a broad base of users. 
              This system will allow growers to be self-sufficient in their data analyses,
              and to procure extension and scientific advice in the e-community.

If
              successful, this system will catalyze the generation and spread of knowledge
              about pests dynamics, cultural practices and management through the different
              layers of agricultural systems.  The proposed integrated system will create the
              basis for a full development of agricultural practices, such as precision
              farming and integrated pest management.
