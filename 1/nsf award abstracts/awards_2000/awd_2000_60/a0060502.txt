Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I Research project addresses the
              environmental issues
confronting the emerging photovoltaic technology based on
              copper indium diselenide.  This technology has just entered the commercial
              market. As it expands into high volume production the industry faces rising raw
              material costs, escalating waste disposal costs and future liabilities.  This
              project develops an electrochemical method specifically tailored to recycle
              photovoltaic modules which contain extremely low quantities of hazardous
              material relative to large bulk stream.  It uses an innovative closed-loop
              approach to remove, separate and regenerate the semiconductor films in a single
              compact system with minimum waste. Phase I will develop the method for copper
              indium diselenide.  The research will lead to unique a prototype recycling
              capability that is safe, fast, cost-effective, non-destructive, simple to
              operate and easy to maintain and that could be readily integrated into the
              manufacturing line. Converting defective panels into efficient modules will
              lead to rapid turn-around and higher production yield.

The innovation will
              provide the photovoltaic industry with a timely and expedient solution to
              manage hazardous waste disposal and improve module production yield.  Its
              implementation would increase productivity, save over 80% on disposal costs,
              recover scarce raw materials and ensure the commercial success of thin-film
              photovoltaic technology.  The approach can be applied to recycle other
              thin-film products, e.g. infrared detectors, flat panel displays, mirror
              scrap.
