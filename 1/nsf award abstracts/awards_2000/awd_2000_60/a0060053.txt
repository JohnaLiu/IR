Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              validation and feasibility of a new technology for the mitigation and
              correction of local scour damage at bridge foundations caused by periodic
              floods, tidal flows, or sustained stream flows. The technology involves a flow
              control device that mitigates the enhanced turbulent mixing and local scour at
              the streambed and is applicable to thousands of bridges nationwide. An
              extensive survey of the nation's bridges has recently been completed by the
              Department of Transportation and the U.S. Geological Survey; and twenty to
              thirty percent of the existing bridges have been found to be scour critical.
              Phase I research will formulate a suitable test matrix to evaluate the
              feasibility and performance for the technology. Scaled flume tests will be
              performed at Colorado State's Hydraulics Laboratory and evaluations for a Phase
              II follow-on R/R&D and commercial applications study will be made. 

If
              successful, the potential for savings by the State and Federal Governments
              through the use of this technology can be conservatively estimated to be over
              10 million a year.
