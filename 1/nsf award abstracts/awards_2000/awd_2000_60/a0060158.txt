Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to
              demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting novel nanocomposite materials for
              significantly improved magnetic performance in high frequency applications,
              using the exchange coupling concept between nanoparticles.  To date, the
              exchange-coupling concept has not been realized in bulk form magnetic
              nanocomposites in high frequency magnetic applications.  The improved
              properties will include a combination of higher permeability, higher electrical
              resistivity, and lower core loss than those for the conventional ferrites.  In
              this project, ceramic coated Fe nanoparticles with various Fe volume fractions
              will be manufactured using a wet-chemical technique.  The performance of the
              end product will be tested and compared with conventional ferrites. 

This
              innovation is expected to have a major impact on the electrical and electronic
              industries by enabling the manufacture of low cost shaped magnetic
              structures.
