Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop full
              waveform models and minimal sensor algorithms for the GDATS eddy current sensor
              (ECS), recently chosen for the EMD phase of the JSF development.  These
              algorithms will enable the practical real-time high performance health
              monitoring for turbine engines. Current processing techniques could require
              four or more sensors; however, these approaches do not make use of all the
              information made available by the ECS.  Using the full ECS signature, it is
              possible, in theory, to estimate integral vibration frequency, phase and
              amplitude using only a single sensor.  The reduction of the number of sensors
              required in each engine stage could potentially save millions of
              dollars.

There are no systems commercially available today for continuous
              health monitoring of aircraft gas turbine engines. The minimal sensor
              algorithms for continuous health monitoring have a large market.  The customers
              are USAF, USN and UK MOD.  Not only are such systems expected to be put on all
              new turbine engines such as for the JSF, but they will be retrofitted to the
              older aircraft as well.
