Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project leads to
              increased productivity at environmental restoration sites through an innovative
              integrated application of geographic information systems (GIS), databases,
              simulation modeling, optimization, and artificial neural networks.  The project
              begins with the understanding that environmental decisions involve many
              stakeholders, each with different priorities among several objectives.  The
              research goals for this environmental information technology project are to: 
              (1) identify and develop a hierarchy of neural networks that efficiently
              estimate uncertainty in data and predict the uncertainty as a result of
              monitoring and remediation decisions; (2) integrate such estimates and data
              into methods to optimize monitoring and remediation operations, which are
              coupled with large-scale simulation models used for environmental fate,
              transport, and risk analysis; (3) store sets of optimized results, which can
              include different stakeholders' objectives and constraints, in databases; and
              (4) present results to decision making end-users through a GIS interface.
 
              
The commercial application of this research, presenting results to decision
              making end-users through a GIS focuses on subsurface (groundwater and soil)
              remediation at thousands of sites nationwide, and will be realized by licensing
              to firms for sales to remediation contractors.  The research has near-term
              applications in climate, weather, air pollution, water, forest, and mineral
              resources, and emergency planning.
