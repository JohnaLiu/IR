Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I  program will develop a
              rapid cure, high strength epoxy adhesive that can be disbonded by application
              of low amperage direct current, is proposed.  This adhesive will allow both the
              rapid assembly and disassembly of manufactured goods. Used as a replacement for
              conventional fasteners, nuts and bolts or welds, this adhesive will provide
              reduced machining costs and increased production rates.  In addition, the
              disbonding feature of the epoxy will permit repair and refurbishment of these
              manufactured items and will allow the rapid end of life disassembly of the
              items greatly facilitating recycling procedures.  The disbonding feature will
              also allow manufacturing errors to be corrected. Currently, the use of aluminum
              in automobile manufacturing is limited by the fact that aluminum cannot be
              easily stretched or bent to compensate for misjoining during welding or other
              fastening operations. The proposed research will involve the development of
              rapid cure chemistries for the electrically disbonding adhesives.  Chemical and
              microstructural analyses will be used to gain insight into the disbonding
              mechanism and allow advancement of the technology. Formulations suitable for
              high volume manufacturing will be developed.

The commercial opportunities
              are wide ranging in manufacturing applications involving automotive,
              electronics
