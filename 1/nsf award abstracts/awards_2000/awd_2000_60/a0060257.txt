Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of a novel method, Combined Atomization and Reaction Technique
              (CART), for mass producing nanometer-sized ceramic powders. The SBIR Phase-I
              research is aimed at designing and building a bench-top CART apparatus to
              demonstrate the general technical and  commercial feasibility of this method as
              applied to the synthesis of nano-sized oxides, carbides, and nitrides of both
              low- and higher-melting metals (e.g., Al, Fe, Si, and Ti). 

Nano-grained
              materials can be employed to replace various load-bearing and non-structural
              parts in automobiles, infrastructures, off-shore structures, pipings,
              containers, and electronic equipment housings, etc. this could be commercial
              attractive to many industries. Transparent nano-grained ceramics can be
              utilized in a broad array of applications including transparent ceramic
              appliance components, clear "glassware" and artistic artifacts. Transparent
              ceramics may be used as ballistic protection armors by law enforcement,
              security police and armored car personnel.
