Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop, deploy, and evaluate a virtual reality-based modeling kit that will
              enable students to collaboratively build, cohabit, and present virtual models
              of the solar system within a web-based inquiry framework.  This system will
              enable students to explore fundamental questions of planetary motion;
              independently or collaboratively construct models of the solar system; share
              and cohabit these virtual models with other local and remote students, mentors
              or teachers through the web; and present these models to large audiences.  This
              general instructional approach has been tested and validated through pilot
              projects using limited off-the-shelf virtual reality tools.  Cybernet Systems
              Corporation believes that this instructional approach and base technology will
              open up an entirely new mode of instruction that will be extendable to many
              other mathematics, science, and technology domains.

The market for the
              project for this immediate version of the software will be middle school earth
              science, high school physics, and university freshman-level astronomy survey
              courses.  It is important to realize that the underlying technology and
              instructional approach will be applicable in a wide range of domains (weather,
              ecology, mathematics, geometric, etc.) and Cybernet Systems Corporation intends
              to explore and develop these potentials in the next phase of the research.  In
              the near term, the research team believes that there is a significant impact to
              be made at all levels with the initial domain of planetary motion.
