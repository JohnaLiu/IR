Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
              nanometer scale photocathode structures for use in miniature high-speed
              photodetectors.  The innovation is to use material property based
              self-assembling techniques to engineer nanostructures for use in optoelectronic
              devices. NanoSciences proposes to prototype nanowire array photocathode
              structures for potential photomultiplier applications.  The technique employed
              is to electroplate Sb into a porous Al2O3 matrix of nanochannels.
The Al2O3
              matrix is partially removed exposing a uniform ordered array of Sb nanowires
              that are exposed to cesium to form Cs3Sb. As a result of the reduced
              dimensionality of the nanostructures, the proposed nanowire photocathode has an
              increased surface area, a tunable refractive index, and a decreased electron
              affinity. These qualities result in enhanced quantum efficiency over
              conventional architectures. 

This research seeks to develop components for
              miniature high-speed photomultipliers that have applications in optical
              communications, medical imaging, night vision systems, robotic and machine
              vision systems, mass spectroscopy, missile defense systems, and basic
              scientific research.
