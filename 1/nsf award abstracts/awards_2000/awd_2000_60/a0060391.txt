Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to
              develop an ultra-fast data retrieval method for multi-layered optical memory
              technology. The memory technology uses 3-D stacking of N paired chiral films
              with unique optical properties. The chiral stack can provide very high areal
              data storage densities of 100 Mb/cm 2 per layer with an equivalent volumetric
              density of 0.5 Tb/cm 3 . The data retrieval method uses image capture and
              pattern recognition techniques instead of the usual bit-by-bit read out
              technique to retrieve a large block of data in a single step. The proposed
              technique can retrieve 2NB bits per readout operation, where the block size B
              can be 100 MB or higher. Retrieval rates of more than6N Gb/s are feasible or 6
              G/s for a single pair of films. The retrieval method utilizes massive
              parallelism and is readily achievable thanks to recent progress in digital
              signal processing and CMOS imager chip technologies. Phase I will demonstrate
              block readout from a pair of stacked chiral storage films (N=1) and will
              develop optimal data organization schemes for both block reading and writing.
              Phase II will develop, build and demonstrate prototypes. Phase III will develop
              product prototypes that lead to commercialization.

The proposed data
              retrieval method provides orders-of-magnitude increases in throughput that will
              benefit all areas of computing performance. The improvements will benefit
              scientific, engineering, business and home computing, in addition to the
              military C3I.
