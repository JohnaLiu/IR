Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and
              evaluate a new class of mixed proton and electron conducting materials which
              are capable of operating at intermediate temperatures (400-700C).  These
              materials could be used as membranes in a wide variety of hydrogen separation
              applications resulting in an efficient, economic, and selective process.  The
              composite materials of interest will be based on a proton conducting oxyacid
              salt and a metallic or ceramic electronically conducting component.  Composite
              powders of different components and compositions will be fabricated using
              various preparation techniques.  These will then be fabricated into dense
              membrane disks, which will subsequently be tested for their structural,
              electrical, and transport properties with the proton and electronic
              conductivity being of particular interest.  The composite materials showing the
              most promise will then be incorporated into laboratory scale membrane
              separation configurations and evaluated for their ability to mediate hydrogen.
              

The development of a new membrane-based hydrogen separation process will
              have multiple applications for use in industry.  It would allow for the
              separation and purification of hydrogen in one step.  Furthermore, these
              membrane systems could act as novel reactors for carrying out different
              chemistries such as hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions at potentially
              lower costs and higher yields.
