Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              a method for making
nanocrystalline strontium ruthenate (SrRuO3) using new
              coordination compounds.  Strontium
ruthenate has been identified as a
              replacement for pure metal electrodes in dielectric and ferroelectric thin-film
              devices.  For these devices, there will be a need for high-density SrRuO3. 
              Strontium ruthenate powder made by traditional solid-state synthetic techniques
              does not sinter sufficiently owing to the powder's large particle size.  To
              achieve higher densities, nanocrystalline SrRuO3 is needed.  Reducing the
              particle size generally reduces the densification temperature making it easier
              to achieve a high-density material.  Chemical routes to produce nanocrystalline
              SrRuO3 will be used.  Coordination compounds will be identified for use as
              precursors.   At the conclusion of Phase I, a precursor will be identified that
              allows for the production of nanocrystalline SrRuO3.

Nanocrystalline SrRuO3
              will be needed to make high-density sputtering targets that will be used to
              make thin-film electrodes in the next generation of high capacity stack storage
              capacitors memory devices.
