Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on
              developing an efficient and cost-effective electrochemical capacitor for use in
              Next-Generation Vehicles (NGV's).  This new capacitor will be designed to
              significantly advance the state of the art in this area, and to fully meet the
              specifications identified for NGV applications.  No current technology meets
              those specifications.  The key innovation here is the development of new
              electrode materials based on recently identified composites.  The Phase I
              program will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach by preparing
              candidate electrode materials, fabricating laboratory-scale capacitors, and
              demonstrating that the prototype capacitors already meet or have the clear
              potential to meet the target specifications.  The capacitors will be evaluated
              in terms of:  (1) specific capacitance (farads/g); (2) specific energy
              (Whr/kg); (3) equivalent series resistance; (4) specific power (W/kg); (5)
              energy density (Whr/L); (6) leakage current; (7) cycle lifetime; (8) ease of
              manufacturing;  and (9) cost.  

Successful development of this enabling
              technology will represent an important advance in the state of the art and will
              provide a key innovation for the commercial development of next-generation
              vehicles.  Other important potential commercial applications include consumer
              electronics, communications, and computer technology.
