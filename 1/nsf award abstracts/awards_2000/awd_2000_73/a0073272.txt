Abstract    :
              Surprisingly little is known about the hormonal basis of species differences in
              avian parental care. Of particular interest is how parental males integrate
              song and territorial behavior with parental behavior, since time spent on one
              activity usually precludes time spent on the other. The objective of the
              proposed research is to determine whether circulating levels of the hormones
              testosterone and prolactin are responsible for the difference in paternal
              behaviors of two related species of songbird, the blue-headed vireo (BHV) and
              the red-eyed vireo (REV). Male BHVs incubate eggs, while male REVs are far more
              typical among songbirds in that they do not.  Thus the species differ greatly
              in the degree to which males contribute to parental care.  Using hormone
              manipulations in free-living males of both species, this research will test
              whether alterations in an individual's circulating hormone levels will lead to
              corresponding alterations in its song and parental behaviors. 
	 The
              mechanisms of parental care in Passeriformes, the largest order of birds, have
              not been examined as closely as those in other avian orders.  The proposed
              research provides a strong test of the predicted functions of testosterone and
              prolactin in parental males.
