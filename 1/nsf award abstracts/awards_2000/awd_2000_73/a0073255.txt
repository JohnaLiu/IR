Symbioses are intimate partnerships between organisms of
              different species, where one partner often lives within the other. Symbiosis is
              one of the most pervasive of all species interactions, yet one of the least
              understood. Changes in population dynamics from symbiosis may lead to cascading
              effects on other species interactions and community structure. In order to
              better understand how population dynamics are affected by symbiosis, the
              proposed research will focus on how a symbiotic microbe, Epichloe glyceriae,
              alters clonal growth characteristics of its host grass, Glyceria striata. The
              consequences of symbiosis on patterns of clonal growth, resource transport
              within host clones, and spatial pattern of infected vs uninfected plants in
              natural populations will be examined.

Symbiosis is important in both natural
              and managed systems, as both positive and negative symbioses are widespread in
              all communities. Understanding the effects of fungal symbiosis on the grwoth
              form of host plants has important implications for the diversity of natural
              communities, productivity of agricultural systems, and management practices for
              conservation. Awareness of the extensive influences of symbiosis will also
              provide a new perspective on community structure, links between species, and
              the importance of biological diversity.
