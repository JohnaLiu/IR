The molecular and stable isotopic compositions (C and H)
              of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and other particle-associated organic
              contaminants in riverine sediments reflect the combined effects of the (1)
              nature of contaminant sources, (2) biotic and abiotic transformation during
              transport, (3) dynamics of particle association and source mixing, (4)
              depositional history and (5) post-depositional diagenetic reactions.  This
              multiplicity of possible sources and processes affecting particle-associated
              organic contaminants in large river systems requires a complete understanding
              of specific processes or sources on the molecular and isotopic chemistry of the
              contaminant.  This in turn requires the availability of multiple
              hydrogeochemical vectors that are able to uniquely identify or seriously
              constrain specific contaminant sources and/or pathways.

Our primary goal is
              to enhance existing approaches to evaluating the sources and fate of
              particle-associated organic contaminants in surface water systems.  We will
              focus on the development of compound-specific 13C/12C and molecular organic
              measurements.  The proposed work will examine the source discrimination
              potential of D/H ratios as well as D/H-specific transformation reactions
              involving hydrocarbons.

Specifically, the impact of volatilization,
              photodegradation, sorption, and biodegradation on the D/H ratios of individual
              PAH compounds will be examined under a range of expected near-surface
              conditions.  The proposed research will also examine the utility of the D/H
              technique for elucidating the sources and fate of PAH in the sediments of the
              St. Lawrence River (SLR) and Hudson River (HR) basins.  These systems exemplify
              the multiplicity of natural and anthropogenic hydrocarbon sources in this
              region and elsewhere, and the long history of human use of these two rivers
              offers some of the most extensive records of anthropogenic hydrocarbon
              deposition and storage in river sediments.
