This award provides partial support for the Nonlinear
              Dynamics and Pattern Formation Conference in Austin, Texas, June 4-6, 2000. The
              Conference will feature topics covering many fields in nonlinear dynamics,
              ranging from fluid and geotrophic flows, to chemical patterns, to biophysics,
              fracture, and dynamics of granular media. Speakers will discuss both
              theoretical and experimental aspects of their research, and provide an overview
              of the profound changes in understanding the dynamics of non-equilibrium
              systems that have taken place as a result of research pursued by Professsor
              Harry L. Swinney and his associates, beginning in the 1970's.

This award
              provides partial support for the Nonlinear Dynamics and Pattern Formation
              Conference in Austin, Texas, June 4-6, 2000. The Conference will discuss
              research related to the work of Professor Harry L. Swinney, who has recently
              celebrated his 60th birthday. Dr. Swinney pioneered the study of complex
              dynamics and chaos in physical and chemical systems far from equilibrium in the
              early 70's and has been director of the award-winning,
              internationally-recognized Center for Nonlinear Dynamics at the University of
              Texas for more than 20 years.  Invited speakers at the conference are leading
              researchers from the many fields of physics that Dr. Swinney has influenced.
