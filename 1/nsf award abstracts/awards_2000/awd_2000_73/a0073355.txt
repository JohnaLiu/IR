              Award:  The 2nd Pacific Basin Conference on Adsorption Science and
              Technology


This award supports partially the participation by 16 American
              researchers in the 2nd Pacific Basin Conference on Adsorption Science and
              Technology, to be held in Brisbane, Australia, from May 14-8, 2000.  This
              conference is the successor to the first such conference, held in Japan three
              years ago.  It brings together about 200 researchers from Asia and the US, as
              well as Europe.  Both academic and industrial researchers will participate in
              sessions on materials, characterization, simulation, theoretical models,
              equilibrium, kinetics, applications, and processes.

Adsorption is a key
              phenomenon in many separation and catalytic processes as well as in nature, and
              the current research activity is dynamic, stimulated by new developments in
              materials synthesis, molecular modeling, and specific applications.  Much of
              the important new work is being done abroad, especially in Japan, so it is
              vital that U.S. researchers maintain contact and collaboration with their
              foreign counterparts.  This conference provides an opportunity to promote such
              contact.
