Abstract    :
              The primary objective of the project is to investigate techniques to utilize
              control independence and compiler-directed multi-threading to exploit
              instruction-level and thread-level parallelism from ordinary programs.  

The
              first step involves investigating the science of ILP that is present when
              utilizing control independence and multi-threading.  Some of the questions that
              are addressed are: what is required to exploit parallelism, how much of the
              parallelism can be exploited by simple techniques such as predicated execution
              or data value prediction, how far should instructions be moved (statically or
              dynamically) to exploit it how is it impacted by practical considerations, how
              can it be enhanced by software transformations, on which portions of the code
              should software transformations be carried out and what should the nature of
              these transformations be, and what are the characteristics of the storage
              needed to exploit the available parallelism?

The second step involves
              investigating hardware and software techniques to exploit the benefits of
              control independence and data speculation in a multi-threading environment.  In
              particular, the use of novel methods to represent/specify control independence
              (and data independence) is investigated.  Issues relevant to multi-threading,
              such as tradeoffs between the number of speculative paths and performance are
              also studied using detailed simulation models.
