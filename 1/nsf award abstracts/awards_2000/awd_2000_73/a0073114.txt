Habitat critical to birds during migration has received little
              conservation and research attention.  This research project investigates the
              spatial scales at which the distribution of stopover habitat influences
              patterns of migrating bird density.  A national network of Doppler surveillance
              radar will be used to estimate bird density and examine habitat-migrant
              associations within continental, regional, and landscape scales.  Using
              hierarchical analysis, patterns of variation in migrant density observed at one
              scale will allow verifiable predictions about patterns at adjacent scales. 
              Field radar studies will be used to relate bird density aloft and the amount of
              radar echo returned by those birds.  This hierarchical approach can provide an
              appropriately scaled basis for identifying conservation areas for migratory
              birds.
