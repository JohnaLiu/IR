Recent resurgence of interest in (U-Th)/He dating has
              been made possible by interpretational advances combined with careful diffusion
              studies and apparently successful tectonic applications and calibrations
              against other thermochronometers. Nevertheless, many exciting aspects of He
              dating remain unexplored. This work comprises a series of experimental studies
              to develop, extend, and calibrate new (U-Th)/He thermochronologic methods. One
              objective is to extend He dating to new phases, including zircon, fluorite, and
              garnet. This is motivated by the potential benefits of low-T thermal
              constraints in rocks that lack these phases in abundance such as many
              sedimentary and hydrothermally mineralized rocks, as well as the unique
              diffusion properties and closure temperatures (Tc) of other phases. A second
              objective is to exploit the property that the diffusion domain for He is
              equivalent to the crystal or grain itself. We will attempt to use this to
              constrain not only cooling ages, but thermal histories of crystals, by
              examining the potential uses of 1) core-to-rim He concentration and age
              zonation within individual crystals using abrasion techniques, and 2) age-grain
              size correlations that reflect specific thermal histories of partially reset
              crystals. A final objective is to rigorously compare (U-Th)/He
              thermochronometry with other methods, primarily multi-domain K-feldspar
              40Ar/39Ar dating to provide intermethod
calibrations and unprecedentedly dense
              time-temperature sampling and thermal constraints. The (U-Th)/He lab at W.S.U.
              is set to begin measuring ages and performing diffusion experiments in May of
              2000, and this funding will provide support for graduate students working on
              experimental development of these methods, in collaboration with with regional
              fission-track and 40Ar/39Ar thermochronologic labs, the economic geology
              programs at W.S.U. and the nearby U.I.
