This project will investigate how coevolution shapes the
              interactions between insects and plants across broad geographic landscapes. A
              major current challenge in ecological research is to understand how ongoing
              coevolution proceeds as interacting species experience different selection
              pressures in different communities (co-evolutionary hotspots). The combined
              ecological, geographic, and phylogenetic evidence allows the opportunity to use
              the interactions between the moth Greya politella and its host plants to
              address these central questions on co-evolutionary processes. The moths are
              locally host specific pollinating seed parasites, and the interaction between
              the moths and their host plants occurs across a wide range of habitats in
              western North America. Three objectives will be addressed in this study. The
              first objective is to determine whether the differences in outcome among
              communities are stable over time, and the second objective will assess whether
              the geographic patterns in outcome result from gene flow among populations in
              different communities. The third objective will be to evaluate how the
              differences in the interaction between the mutualistic and antagonistic
              hotspots identified during previous work contribute to the different ecological
              outcomes. Together, the results of these three objectives will aid in the
              development of the theory of coevolution and the organization of biodiversity.
              They will address how selection mosaics and co-evolutionary hotspots shape
              species interactions across geographic landscapes under different ecological
              conditions. Overall, the results will therefore contribute to our understanding
              of the geographic scale at which interspecific interactions diversity and the
              ways in which coevolution links taxa among communities.
