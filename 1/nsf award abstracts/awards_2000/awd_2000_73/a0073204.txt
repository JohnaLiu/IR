This project explores evolution of floral morphology
              in the plant family Capparaceae from two different perspectives: (1) genealogy
              or phylogenetic relationships and (2) developmental biology.  Using differences
              in DNA sequences and morphology, genealogical relationships within this family
              and its close relative Brassicaceae (mustard family) will be analyzed.  This
              analysis will provide the framework for more detailed studies of two African
              genera, entailing intensive field work and developmental studies of floral
              buds.  Patterns of development will lead to formulation of explicit hypotheses
              of possible genes that may be responsible for smaller scale changes in floral
              form, utlizing the wealth of knowledge gleaned from the model organism,
              Arabidopsis (Brassicaceae).  Pollination field studies will also be conducted
              to evaluate roles that pollinators may have in changes in floral form.
              

There have been great advances made in our knowledge of phylogenetic
              relationships of plants and on developmental genetics of flowers.  In general,
              these fields have evolved independently of one another.  Phylogenies are
              powerful tools for exploring evolution of floral form and, at the same time,
              developmental studies provide a genetic model for changes in floral forms of
              model organisms.  Combination of these fields permits exploration of underlying
              genetic mechanisms for evolution of morphological variation.
