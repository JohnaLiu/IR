Abstract    :
              Eric Heller of Harvard University is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program and the Atomic, Molecular, Optical, and Plasma
              Physics Program to continue his investigations of long wavelength, ultracold
              scattering phenomena including proximity resonances and cold collisions. 
              Studies of semiclassical approaches and tunneling phenomena with relevance to
              molecular physics will be undertaken.  Also, new explorations of mesoscopic
              systems will be initiated, in particular scattering in confined geometries
              relevant to atomic waveguides, Kondo scattering and resonances in STM quantum
              corrals, and molecular STM spectroscopy and dynamics of small molecules on
              surfaces.  Fundamental exploration of phase space localization of
              eigenfunctions, with emphasis on statistics of unimolecular decay lifetimes,
              will be pursued.  Heller is also supported by the Science Literacy Program to
              produce a public exhibition of work inspired by quantum chaos
              investigations.

Each of the projects here is related by common threads,
              including scattering theory, semiclassical theory, and chaos theory.  They are
              also related by common approaches, including fundamental mathematical theory as
              well as computer modeling and computer experimentation.  The outcomes of this
              research will enable improved understanding of the way molecules and small
              devices work, and to make possible the design, prediction, and control of their
              behavior.  The informal science education project will demonstrate that
              discovery and knowledge can result from visualization.
