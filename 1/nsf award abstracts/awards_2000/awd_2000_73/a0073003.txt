The fundamental particles and interactions in nature are
              currently 
described by the Standard Model, with the sector of strong
              
interactions described by QCD.  The open and difficult challenge 
is to
              understand in detail how these theories describe the 
properties of matter.
              The empirical knowledge of the subnucleonic 
(quark and gluon) degrees of
              freedom in the structure of baryons and 
mesons and their interactions is
              essential for understanding the 
nature and dynamics of the fundamental
              nuclear interactions.  
A program in medium-energy nuclear physics is being
              planned 
that will bring new and important information for these issues. 
The
              properties of baryons can be explored by bringing pion 
and kaon beams onto
              proton targets.  Critical tests of the 
Standard Model can also be made by
              studying specific decays 
of kaons.  Because the experimental work will be
              carried out 
at large accelerator facilities in the U.S. and Europe, the
              
planning activities will include travel to these facilities or 
other
              institutions for detailed discussions with collaborators, 
as well as computer
              simulations and calculations for the 
experiments that are anticipated.
