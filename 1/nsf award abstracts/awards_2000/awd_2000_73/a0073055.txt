Evidence of strong direct effects of predators ("top-down") and
              resources ("bottom-up") are emerging from mathematical models and simplified
              assemblages. Data from natural communities are necessary to improve our
              understanding of their combined effects over multiple scales.  Using
              large-scale surveys combined with manipulative field experiments at a single
              site, this project examines the trophic interactions of avian predators and
              arthropod assemblages of the Hawaiian myrtaceous tree Metrosideros polymorpha. 
              Across a four million-year gradient of volcanic substrate age, nutrient
              availability varies in a unimodal fashion.  Arthropod densities on Metrosideros
              track this relationship across the island chain, suggesting a strong influence
              of resources to the system.  Species diversity accumulates with geological age
              and is independent of density.  These relationships will be evaluated on a
              young basaltic lava flow (<120 y.o.) where Metrosideros plant communities are
              nutrient limited and respond to fertilization with a tenfold increase in
              productivity.  Vertebrate predators (birds) are to be excluded and large plots
              will be fertilized in a completely crossed well-replicated design.  The
              proposed research program combines the scales and perspectives of observational
              data on natural patterns with controlled field experiments, thereby expanding
              the scope of inference from either approach alone.
