Abstract    :
              Male birds participate in parental care more than males of any other vertebrate
              group.  Thus, birds represent an extraordinary model to untangle the various
              factors that affect care of young. When breeding begins, males experience a
              rise in the hormone testosterone (T) that declines by the time young hatch. 
              This pattern may represent a trade-off between T levels and expression of
              paternal care: experimentally, high levels of T are associated with reduced
              paternal care in favor of enhanced sexual behavior.  In chestnut-collared
              longspurs (CCLO), experimentally increased T enhances sexual behavior before
              eggs hatch, but surprisingly, does not reduce care of nestlings.  This study
              will test the hypothesis that this unusual insensitivity to T during the
              parental phase occurs because males are critical for nestling survival.  By
              manipulating environmental and hormonal variables, this study will determine
              (1) if male care is essential, (2) if the environment drives male care, and (3)
              if elevated T affects nest defense in CCLO.  Male care, though generally rare
              in nature, is prevalent in birds.  Whether paternal care is driven by
              environmental factors or by internal cues, however, is unknown.  This study
              will help to unravel the relative roles of hormones and environmental cues on
              the expression of paternal care.  Determining the role of environmental factors
              in the  apparent trade-off between T and paternal care is particularly
              important, because it can be applied to additional systems in which paternal
              care is critical for survival of young.
