The investigators
              from three collaborating institutions (Indiana University, UNAVCO/UCAR, and
              Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology) will continue an ongoing
              study of deformation associated with tectonic and magmatic activity at Taal
              volcano, Philippines. The project involves operation of a state-of-the-art,
              continous volcano monitoring network, consisting of three dual-frequency Global
              Positioning System (GPS) receivers, and a newly developed 12-station
              single-frequency GPS volcanic monitoring system. The project promises to
              improve understanding of the magmatic system associated with active volcanic
              processes at an active, subduction-related volcano; to provide refined spatial
              control on magma movement via continuous observation of crustal motion from a
              dense GPS volcanic monitoring system; to identify spatial and temporal
              interactions between tectonic structures and volcanic systems; and to provide
              testing and further development of a new, state-of-the-art volcanic monitoring
              system.
