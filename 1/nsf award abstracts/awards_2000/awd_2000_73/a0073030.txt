Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to provide travel and living expenses for some
              students and faculty to participatein the 17th International Symposium on
              Mathematical Programming (ISMP 2000) to be held at the Georgia Institute of
              Technology, August 7 - August 11, 2000.  The support will be provided only to
              those who otherwise could not afford to attend.  The project is split funded by
              the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of International Programs
              and the Division of Design, Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation and will
              fund participants in two categories:   1.Domestic  2.International scientists
              from Eastern Europe.          In the first category, preference will be given
              to students, junior collegues, women and minorities.                  
The
              term mathematical programming is synonymous with optimization.  In a
              mathematical programming or optimization problem, one seeks to maximize or
              minimize an objective function, subject to constraints on the variables. 
              Research in the field covers a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from the
              theoretical analysis of the structural properties of optimization problems and
              the development and implementation of algorithms for their solution, to
              practical work in areas such as telecommunications, logistics, manufacturing,
              structural engineering, economics, finance, biology and even pure mathematics. 
              Recent successful applications include the design of survivable
              telecommunication networks, crew scheduling, vehicle routing, production and
              inventory control, VLSI layout, the design of lightweight, durable engineering
              structures, portfolio planning and DNA string matching.  The symposium covers
              the latest research results in the field with plenary presentations given by
              leading international experts and many other talks (more than 1000) given by
              scientists from more than 40 countries.  The symposium is held every three
              years and is considered to be the major event in the field.
