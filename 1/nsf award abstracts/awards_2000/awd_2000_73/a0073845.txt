The exploration of the outer Solar System has developed
              rapidly in the past decade, with the discovery of large numbers of small, solid
              objects in the trans-Neptunian region.  These objects have been found with CCD
              cameras on medium and large sized telescopes, which to date have surveyed ~100
              square degrees of sky.  This new project, led by Dr. Charles Alcock of the
              University of Pennsylvania, is intended to provide an important complement to
              recent, very successful surveys of the outer Solar System.  Specifically, Dr.
              Alcock's survey will cover ~3000 square degrees with high sensitivity to
              objects in the size range between Pluto and recently discovered trans-Neptunian
              objects (TNO).  A powerful observing system developed for the MACHO project (a
              project to detect massive objects via the technique of gravitational lensing)
              will be utilized for the survey.  This award is made through the Planetary
              Astronomy Program.
