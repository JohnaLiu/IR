New England has long been studied geologically,
              and the evolution of Central New England during the Devonian Acadian Orogeny is
              broadly understood as an early Devonian collisional event.  However, there are
              a number of questions about the timing of metamorphism, assembly and exhumation
              of this terrane that are of fundamental significance in the development of this
              and any compressional orogen.  This project will employ powerful new techniques
              of age dating to provide the detailed age control that was not available during
              the classic Acadian studies.  Results are expected to help place the timing of
              peak metamorphism in a tectonic framework, to assess the possibility of time -
              transgressive metamorphism along strike and to evaluate scenarios for producing
              inverted metamorphic sequences.  While focused on their classic orogen,
              knowledge of these relationships is applicable to developing models for the
              evolutions of all orogenic belts.
