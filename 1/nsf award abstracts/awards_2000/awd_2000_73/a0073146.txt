Abstract    :
              Bats are critical for the pollination of hundreds of different plant
species in
              environments from arid deserts to tropical rainforests.  Some New
World bats
              exist entirely on nectar and pollen, while others visit flowers
to supplement
              their regular diets of fruit or insects.  The shape of the
skull is associated
              with the relative reliance on nectar in the diet.  This
study investigates
              nectar-feeding ability (performance) among six species of
bats that range from
              occasional flower visitors to nectar specialists.
Feeding performance is
              measured by filming captive bats feeding at
artificial flowers that differ in
              both shape and nectar availability.  These
experiments evaluate the impact of
              flower shape on feeding performance, the
maximum distance bats can extend the
              tongue, and how well bats can extract
small amounts of nectar.  The feeding
              experiments are coupled with a
detailed analysis of skull and tongue structure
              to establish associations
between anatomy and feeding performance.
     This
              research contributes to our understanding of the biological and
functional
              importance of anatomical diversity, and adds to the picture of
how these bats
              function within their ecosystems.  By constraining behavioral
capabilities,
              anatomical differences ultimately help sculpt ecological
patterns of resource
              use and mediate the interactions between bats and
flowers.  This combination
              of anatomical and behavioral data will provide
new insights into the
              diversity, evolution, and ecology of these important
pollinators.
