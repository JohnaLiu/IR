     Three mechanisms - protrusion of the lamellipodial
              actin
network, graded adhesion of the cytoskeleton to the surface,
              and
cytoskeletal contraction - acting in concert are both necessary
and
              sufficient to produce highly effective cell movement.  Actual
rates and forces
              of protrusion depend on local concentrations of
actin monomers and polymers
              and a host of actin capping,
nucleation, polymerization and adhesion proteins
              near the cell's
leading edge.  The investigator derives partial
              differential
equations that couple the chemical kinetics of all these
              protein
concentrations to the model of cytoskeletal mechanics. 
              These
equations are solved analytically and quantify molecular
mechanisms of
              protrusion localization at the cell's leading edge
and regulation of
              protrusion rates and forces.  Experiments
suggest that the force of the
              cytoskeletal contraction is myosin
powered.  The investigator models the
              dynamics of actin filaments
and myosin clusters in physical and angular space
              and describes
the actomyosin dynamic contraction mechanism
              quantitatively.
Using this description, the investigator analyzes
              mechanochemical
feedback loops between systems of traction, protrusion and
              graded
adhesion within the frameworks of interactive computer models
varying
              in complexity.  These models are applied to migration of
fish keratocyte and
              nematode amoeboid sperm.  Comparison of
theoretical results with experiment
              clarify the roles of
cytoskeletal, adhesion and membrane systems in cellular
              movements
and concepts of motility, polarizability and directionality. 
              The
models allow testing of plausible scenarios of cell movements.
    
              Migration of animal cells is a fundamentally important
process underlying the
              phenomena of wound healing, morphogenesis
and cancer.  Current experimental
              research is aimed at dissecting
the complex processes of migration into
              simpler phenomena that
can be more easily analyzed.  The investigator models
              these
motility phenomena theoretically, which will allow biologists to
test
              quantitatively the existing qualitative ideas.  Specifically,
the investigator
              examines mathematically the molecular basis and
the principles of
              self-organization of cell mechanics and
develops computer models that
              reproduce the observed patterns of
cell locomotion.  Results of the modelling
              will provide a new
interdisciplinary level of understanding cell movements and
              new
methods of predicting cell behavior in important medical
              and
technological situations.
