Abstract    :
              This project addresses several topics at the 
interface between mathematics,
              physics, and
materials science. One theme is epitaxial
growth, particularly
              the task of linking
microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of
growth. A
              second theme is the interaction
of bulk and surface energies, which determine
              
the structure of defects and the selection of
patterns in diverse systems
              such as stressed
films and dielectric fluids. A third theme is
the analysis
              of composite microstructure, where
methods developed for image processing seem
              to
offer fresh opportunities.

Materials have structure on many length
              scales.
The tasks of (a) predicting this structure,
and (b) understanding its
              consequences, are among 
the major challenges of modern materials science.
              
Mathematical methods such as homogenization,
asymptotic analysis, and
              multiresolution methods
can help. This project will develop and apply
              such
methods in the context of specific material systems,
leading to enhanced
              understanding of those systems
and improvement of the mathematical methods
              themselves
