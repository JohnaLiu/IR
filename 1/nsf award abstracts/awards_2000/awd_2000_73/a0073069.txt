Abstract    :
              The project is a continuation of DMS-9704867 which was entitled Renormalization
              and Global Bifurcation.
Tresser and co-worker P.Coullet introduced the notion
              of renormalization in the theory of dynamical systems and conjectured
              universality of the transition to chaos in a variety of natural systems. The
              corresponding renormalization theory
deals with the small scale geometrical
              structure of one-dimensional dynamical systems. Tresser used renormalization
              concepts to describe the bifurcation diagram of a large class of families of
              dynamical systems.
The renormalization phenomena are observed in a wide range
              of applications.
One would like to have a renormalization theory which is
              widely applicable. For
This reason Martens initiated a real one-dimensional
              renormalization theory for unimodal maps. This work uses as less as possible
              underlying structure.
The aim of this project is to locate more examples of
              renormalization, explore 
the corresponding bifurcation phenomena and continue
              the development of the
above mentioned real one-dimensional renormalization
              theory.
