Gene regulation during early stages of
              development entails a complex set of interactions. In the fruit fly
              (Drosophila), these steps are determined by the maternal contributions of both
              proteins and messenger RNA (mRNA) to the oocyte as well as by transcriptional
              and translational regulation of zygotic and maternal genes. The orchestration
              of anterior-posterior (A-P) patterning in the Drosophila embryo is one of the
              best-studied systems. The complexity of this system and the dual nature of
              control (maternal and zygotic) provide an attractive model for
              microevolutionary studies of gene regulation and maternal effect dynamics. This
              study uses experimental and theoretical approaches to model and interpret the
              pattern of genetic variation in regulatory sequences and the evolutionary
              potential within and between species for genes involved in this process
              (bicoid, nanos, caudal, hunchback, pumilio).  Embryonic phenotypes will be
              scored, including the distribution and quantities of morphogen mRNA and
              proteins in third-chromosome-homozygous lines of Drosophila melanogaster and
              related species. The upstream regulatory DNA sequences (promoters) of these
              genes will be sequenced and correlated with phenotypic variation. The goals are
              to identify natural existing variation in the genes involved in the
              dosage-dependent process of A-P patterning, to test the hypothesis of
              compensatory mutations, and to parameterize models of evolutionary change in
              regulatory regions.
