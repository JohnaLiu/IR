The genetic basis of the formation of new species
              is a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology.  In this study, a European
              hybrid zone between two closely related species of house mice (Mus domesticus
              and M. musculus) will be used to locate genomic regions potentially involved in
              reproductive isolation.  Fifteen DNA markers, equally spaced along the X
              chromosome, will be genotyped in 254 individuals.  Patterns of variation at
              these markers will be used to identify chromosomal regions that cause
              reproductive isolation.  The house mouse system features all the genetic tools
              of a model organism and provides one of the first opportunities to identify
              genes that may play a role in speciation using naturally hybridizing
              populations.

This project promises to increase our understanding of the
              genetics of the speciation process.  This goal is important for two reasons. 
              First, speciation is a topic of intense theoretical and empirical interest
              among biologists.  Because the reproductive isolation between natural
              populations must be genetic for speciation to occur, discovering the number and
              kind of genes involved is crucial.  Second, speciation studies contribute to an
              understanding of the overall genesis of biodiversity.  The genetic details of
              the speciation process provide information on the characteristics and timing of
              biological diversification.
