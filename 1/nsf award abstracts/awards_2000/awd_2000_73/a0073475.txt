Abstract    :
              Coherent pulse-Doppler radar systems typically transmit pulse-trains made up of
              identical pulses. While these pulses may contain complex modulation that
              enhances their ability to separate closely spaced scatterers in delay (range)
              or Doppler (radial velocity), the fact remains that the pulses making up the
              pulse-train are usually identical. The aim of this research is to investigate
              the advantages of pulse-trains made up of pulses that are distinctly different
              from pulse-to-pulse. This research involves the design of waveform sets and
              associated signal processing that yield enhanced ability to separate closely
              spaced scatterers and increase the accuracy of pulse-echo measurements. The
              problems of diversity waveform measurement (using a fixed set of different
              pulse-waveforms) as well as adaptive selection of pulse waveforms based on past
              measurements of the scattering scenario will be considered. The significance of
              this work lies in the fact that it allows for higher resolution imaging or
              discrimination of radar scatterers than is possible using a single waveform.
              Applications that could benefit from this enhanced resolution include synthetic
              aperture radar imaging, earth based radar astronomy, Doppler weather radar,
              ionospheric radio sounding, active sonar imaging systems, and monostatic and
              multistatic radar and sonar tracking systems.
