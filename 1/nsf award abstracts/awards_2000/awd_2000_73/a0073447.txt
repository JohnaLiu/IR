Stellar occultations can probe ring systems and
              atmospheres in the outer solar system
with spatial resolutions of a few
              kilometers-several orders of magnitude better than the
resolution of any other
              Earth-based method.  Dr. Elliot and his co-researchers will observe the highest
              quality occultations by the giant planet systems occurring during the 2000-2003
              period and then use these data to investigate several physical aspects of rings
              and atmospheres.  The program emphasizes a combination of the highest temporal
              resolution multi-wavelength observations possible using today's and tomorrow's
              state-of-the-art instrumentation, along with further analyses of the highest
              quality archived occultation observations. In addition to observations of
              Uranus and several Jovian events (particularly those sampling auroral regions),
              a strong observational emphasis is being placed on Titan and Saturn leading up
              to the 2004 arrival of the Cassini spacecraft and the deployment of the Huygens
              probe into Titan's atmosphere. The occultation studies will include an
              investigation of the temperature, pressure, and number density profiles in the
              upper atmospheres of Uranus, Jupiter, and Saturn. This project is funded by the
              Planetary Astronomy Program in the Division of Astronomical Sciences.
