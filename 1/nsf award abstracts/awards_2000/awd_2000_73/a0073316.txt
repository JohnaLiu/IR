Populations frequently adapt to their local environment,
              and this adaptation may be diminished by the influx of genes from different,
              non-local populations of the same species.  The movement of genes from
              horticultural and restoration plantings into wild plant populations requires
              three successive stages.  First, pollinators must not discriminate against the
              non-local individuals and therefore move pollen from ornamental and restoration
              plantings into local populations.  Secondly, the pollen of non-local plants
              must be able to fertilize the ovules of the wild population even in the
              presence of local pollen.  Finally, the hybrid progeny resulting from a cross
              between wild and horticultural plants must establish and maintain themselves in
              the field.  This study investigates each of these stages using  the native
              cardinal flower, Lobelia cardinalis.  Experimental manipulation will measure
              the distance of pollen movement, the relative efficiency of local and non-local
              pollen at fertilization, and the performance of successive generations of
              hybrids.

This doctoral dissertation study addresses all steps of
              hybridization between non-local and wild populations in an experimental
              setting.  The results of this work have implications for conservation,
              specifically for the potential for interactions between restoration and
              horticultural plantings of native species with wild populations.
