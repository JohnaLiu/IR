Abstract    :
              International Symposium on Advanced Control of Chemical Processes (ADCHEM),
              organized under the auspices of the International Federation of Automatic
              Control (IFAC), is a continuing series of international meetings which have
              traditionally focused on advances in methods for control and estimation and are
              part of a three year rotation of IFAC meetings in process control.

ADCHEM
              2000, to be held in Pisa, Italy, aims to bring together researchers and
              developers of new methodologies in the area of process control as well as users
              of these techniques.  ADCHEM 2000 will focus the development and application in
              six subareas:
- Modeling and Simulation
- Model Based Control
- Realtime
              Optimization
- Process and Control Monitoring
- Process Identification
