This grant is supported by the Divisions of Materials Research,
              Physics and Mathematical Sciences.  The focus of the grant is the exact study
              of statistical mechanics of strongly interacting many-body systems and their
              connection with pure mathematics and condensed matter physics.  The strongly
              interacting systems of greatest interest are the XXZ spin-1/2 chain, lattice
              models for generalized exclusion statistics and integrable perturbations, and
              Ising and dimer models particularly on higher genus lattices.
