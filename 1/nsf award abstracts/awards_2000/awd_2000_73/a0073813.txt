The objective of this project is to develop a quantitative
              model to explain geologic examples of clay-quartz and clay-carbonate surface
              interactions.  In a general way this work will lead to a fundamental
              understanding of the interaction of dissimilar mineral surfaces separated by
              water films. We plan experiments to measure surface forces between micas and
              silica separated by water films. From these experiments we will develop a model
              predicting short-range adhesion forces and long-range hydration and 
              'colloidal' forces,  and diffusion in molecularly thin aqueous fluid films
              trapped between two dissimilar mineral surfaces.  The effects of temperature
              and pressure on these interactions will also be investigated.  The experiments
              will be guided by the composition of natural materials exhibiting clay-mineral
              interaction which are found over a wide range of geologic conditions.
