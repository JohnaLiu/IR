In nature, male and female interests over reproduction are
              usually in conflict. Females tend to invest more heavily in each offspring than
              do males.  As a result, females must carefully choose the best father for their
              offspring while males may increase their reproductive success by inseminating
              many females. Conflicts over paternity become particularly intriguing when
              females mate multiply and the conflict must be resolved within the female
              reproductive tract.  

In a group of spiders with diverse reproductive
              morphologies, this study will explore how behavior and reproductive tract
              morphology may bias paternity.  Light and scanning electron microscopy will be
              used to accurately describe female reproductive morphology in four focal taxa. 
              Behavioral analysis will be used to uncover how males and females may influence
              paternity by manipulating the timing, duration, and frequency of copulation,
              re-mating interval, oviposition timing, etc.   Molecular markers will be used
              to assess paternity when females have been experimentally mated with multiple
              males.

These studies will shed light on the interplay between the
              constraints imposed by history and the adaptations that females and males may
              evolve. This is an area of growing interest in evolutionary biology.
