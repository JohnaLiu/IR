There are several phenomena that can lead to currently
              observed genetic patterns in natural populations.  One powerful method that has
              been developed to choose among these various phenomena is the nested-analysis
              procedure.  While this method has been utilized successfully in several
              organisms it has only been applied to land dwelling organisms.  Certain
              modifications to the methodology may be needed when it is applied to organisms
              occupying aquatic habitats.  The goals of this study are to examine the
              nested-analysis procedure for the case of aquatic organisms and outline the
              most appropriate ways to analyze data from these types of populations.  This
              study will utilize DNA sequences from 60 different crayfish populations
              collected from throughout Missouri to test the appropriateness of modifying the
              procedure for aquatic organisms.  Two variations of the procedure will be
              conducted:  1) the standard methodology (geographic coordinates) and 2) a
              modification for use with aquatic organisms (in-river distances).  Results of
              the two methods will then be compared for significant deviations in the
              inferred phenomena.  

This study will allow for the proper extension of the
              nested-analysis procedure to aquatic organisms.  Without such a study, the
              inferences made about the genetic structure of aquatic organisms using standard
              methodologies may be misleading.
