One of the great challenges to biology is
              understanding how genes are deployed during an organism's development to
              produce the astonishing variety of creatures on earth.  A variety of biological
              phenomena can, if studied in detail, help us gain a better understanding of
              these genetic blueprints. One such phenomenon, morphological polymorphism, is
              widespread in nature, and has appeared independently in many different types of
              organisms.  In ants, for example, depending on the environmental conditions an
              individual ant embryo experiences, it will either develop into a reproductive
              caste (male or a queen) with wings or develop into a sterile caste (worker or
              soldier) without wings.  Where, when. and which genes are turned off or on
              during development to produce antomical differenes among siblings? 

This
              study examines the genes involved in this morphological polymorphism in ants by
              integrating data from multiple biological levels and from multiple species.  It
              will characterize the expression of several genes involved in wing development,
              cell growth, and hormonal regulation.  The goals are to determine: (1) whether
              the genes involved in wing development are conserved in winged reproductive
              ants;  (2) how the patterning, growth, and differentiation of wings in wingless
              non-reproductive ants is interrupted; and (3) whether the process of
              interruption in wingless non-reproductive ants has evolved.  Understanding the
              genetic basis of this phenomenon will provide insights into the relationship
              between an organism's genes, the environment, and anatomy.
