This research focuses on new mathematical algorithms
              for improved synchronization and detection of direct-sequence code-division
              multiple access (DS-CDMA) signals.  In DS-CDMA applications such as cellular
              telephony, multiple signals from user handsets are received simultaneously at a
              base 
station.  In order to accommodate the maximum number of users, the
              times-of-arrival (delays) and channel distortions of all received signals must
              be simultaneously tracked.  In this project, the channel/delay parameters are
              tracked using a modified extended Kalman filtering (EKF) algorithm.
More
              sophisticated EKF algorithms are also evaluated that perform forward error
              correction decoding (Turbo-CDMA) jointly with channel/delay estimation.  The
              resulting algorithms provide 
reduced symbol error rates and hence increased
              system capacity.  The results of the research are applicable to a broad range
              of DS-CDMA systems, including third-generation mobile telephony, wireless
              local-area networks, and ad-hoc networks.
