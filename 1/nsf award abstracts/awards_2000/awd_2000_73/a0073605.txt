Uranus' collection of 10 narrow rings has been studied
              extensively with the stellar
occultation method. This method yields high
              spatial resolution data for observers at Earth and therefore allows long time
              baseline observations of the rings. Some occultations occur near a planet's
              stationary point, when the planet's apparent motion on the sky-plane approaches
              zero. By virtue of their slow velocity, these events can yield higher
              signal-to-noise data. One such event for Uranus occurred in 1987; the
              occultation of the star U36 took place over 4 days with sky-plane velocities
              between 0.3 and 1.5 km/sec.  Dr.  Amanda Bosh will utilize these unusual data
              to search for small-amplitude distortions on ring edges that are detectable
              only with slow-velocity earth-based data or in situ imaging or stellar
              occultations.  She will analyze the occultation data by modeling occultation
              light curves as diffraction profiles of semi-opaque square wells. She will also
              employ occultation geometry and ring kinematics modeling techniques that have
              been successfully used for investigations of Saturn's ring structure. The
              ring-edge distortions, if identified, may aid in refining global kinematic
              models for the Uranian rings. In addition, through analysis of the wavelength
              and amplitude of the distortion, one can
infer the existence of one or more
              nearby shepherding satellites. Both improved kinematics and satellite detection
              are waypoints toward better understanding of the confinement mechanisms for
              narrow rings.  This award is made through the Planetary Astronomy
              Program.
