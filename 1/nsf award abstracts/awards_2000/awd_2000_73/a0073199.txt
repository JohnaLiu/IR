Cannatella and Brown
	Asian and Melanesian forest frogs provide an
              excellent model system for studying the effects of body size, ecological
              habitat, and evolutionary history on diversity of acoustic communication
              systems. Frogs of the subfamily Platymantinae, including the large genus
              Platymantis (with an estimated 45-65 species), show a range of "advertisement
              calls" (often for mating) differing widely in spectral character (call
              frequencies) and temporal structure (rates of call delivery). Factors that may
              have influenced the evolution of this acoustic diversity are under study by
              graduate student Rafe Brown, with guidance from faculty adviser Dr. David
              Cannatella at the University of Texas. A phylogenetic study of platymantine
              frogs will be conducted using both morphological and molecular (DNA sequences)
              data to provide the historical framework for establishing the likely direction
              of character change among the sublineages of the genus. In turn, this
              phylogenetic framework will be employed to study variation among species in
              morphology-related and physiology-related classes of call characters. Because
              species of Platymantis exhibit a range of habitat preferences, from forest
              floor to the canopy, the genus constitutes an ideal system for studying the
              effects of constraints posed by different forest habitats on signal
              transmission and evolution. Also, the study will explore biomechanic features
              of vocal sac functioning and relate these to temporal and spectral characters
              of the advertisement calls in the field.
