Scientists have described carbonados as "the most
              enigmatic of all diamonds."  They occur as pea-sized black nodules of fused
              diamond crystallites with relatively large void spaces that can account for
              more than 15% of the total volume.  Some scientists have proposed a host of
              theories to account for their formation, some of which would dramatically
              influence our perception of the history and chemistry of the Earth if proved
              true.  For example, some scientists believe that carbonados formed by a single
              massive meteorite impact in the late Archean, whereas others postulate that
              carbonados are an exotic style of diamond from the Earth's upper mantle.  We
              intend to test these hypotheses by comparing carbonado textures and mineral
              inclusions with those in polycrystalline diamonds that crystallized deep within
              the earth and by meteorite impact.  In addition, we will perform
              state-of-the-art imaging and geochemical analyses to explore for indicators
              that will unambiguously demonstrate the formation mechanisms of these unusual
              diamonds.
