Abstract    :
              The early Eocene biota of Meridian, Mississippi, includes a diverse biota from
              plants, molluscs, fishes, snakes, birds, and mammals that were deposited in
              estuarine channels and swamps.  All sites yielding this unique early Eocene
              biota occur on privately-owned lland that is scheduled for imminent
              development.  This proposal will salvage as much of the ancient biota of this
              region and associated contextual data as is possible prior to its permanent
              loss to science because of commercial development.  Two weeks of field work on
              site will concentrate on screen-washing large volumes of fossiliferous
              sediment, in order to sample the vertebrates of the Tuscahoma and Bashi
              formations.  Further sorting in the laboratory will identify useful fossil
              specimens and fragments.
