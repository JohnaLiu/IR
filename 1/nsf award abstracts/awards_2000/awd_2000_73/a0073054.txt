The genome wide pattern of nonrandom association
              between different alleles of two genes, called linkage disequilibrium (LD), is
              not well understood.  Recent work in a Caucasian population revealed a
              heterogeneous distribution of LD, a pattern consistent with the action of
              natural selection on genes in some regions.  This study will determine whether
              LD is distributed similarly in ethnically diverse human populations and will
              evaluate the effects of demography on the distribution of LD by characterizing
              LD nine genomic regions in three diverse human populations.  To measure LD,
              allelic associations will be determined for 103 genetic markers, chosen using
              the data available from the Human Genome Project.

This study is a
              comparative characterization of LD in several human populations that will aid
              in understanding genomic evolution.  Regions of the human genome that show high
              levels of LD in several ethnically diverse populations are likely to contain
              genes experiencing selection in the human species.  Discovering genes which
              have experienced selection is relevant to the study of disease and aids in
              understanding human biological history.  Knowledge about how LD depends on
              demography will aid in deciding which populations are appropriate to use for LD
              mapping of genes responsible for complex diseases and traits.
