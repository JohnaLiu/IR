Abstract    :
              Current microprocessors, which have much wider data-paths than 8 or 16 bit
              data-words required by multimedia workloads, are attempting to take advantage
              of this by offering special multimedia instructions. These extensions are a set
              of short SIMD or superword operations. It has been shown that short SIMD
              operations are well suited to exploit a fundamentally different type of
              parallelism than the vector parallelism associated with traditional vector
              supercomputers.  This parallelism is denoted as Superword Level Parallelism
              (SLP) since parallelism comes in the form of superwords containing packed
              data.

In this project, compiler algorithms for detection and exploitation of
              superword level parallelism are investigated. The compiler is extended in many
              directions, from dataword prediction to SLP aware register allocation, to take
              advantage of superword level parallelism and an extensive evaluation of these
              techniques is performed. Architectures that can take full advantage of SLP are
              also investigated in this research.  Scaling the data-paths is a simple and
              straightforward use of the available silicon area. However, there are novel
              architectural features that can take full advantage of superword level
              parallelism.
