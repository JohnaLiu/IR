The Himalaya are the product of collision between India
              and Asia, and the Main Central Thrust (MCT) is a major fault that has
              accommodated Indo-Asian convergence. A longstanding problem in understanding
              the dynamics of the MCT is explaining its "inverted" metamorphic sequence:
              ordinarily pressure (P) and temperature (T) increase downward, yet across the
              MCT, structurally higher rocks preserve higher metamorphic P's and T's than
              rocks below. Different explanations for formation and preservation of inverted
              metamorphism imply different pressure-temperature-time (P-T-t) histories for
              each rock. The purpose of this study is to characterize P-T-t paths in a
              transect across the MCT and evaluate competing hypotheses. This work is
              important for understanding both the Indo-Asian collision and the tectonic
              significance of inverted metamorphic sequences in general.
