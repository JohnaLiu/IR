Why tropical birds lay a small, usually 2-egg, clutch is a
              persistent enigma. Many suggested hypotheses assume selective pressures
              influencing nestling mortality or adult survival explain clutch size, but
              supporting data are lacking. The ability of parents to care for juveniles after
              they have left the nest may be an important factor in the evolution of small
              clutch size in tropical birds and has never been investigated. This hypothesis
              will be tested by manipulating clutch size and parental effort per juvenile in
              the Spotted Antbird, a small passerine endemic to Central America. Preliminary
              data indicate that juveniles from smaller clutches (i.e. one egg) have enhanced
              post-fledging survival probability and receive proportionately greater
              post-fledging parental care than do juveniles from normal 2-egg clutches. A
              possible explanation for this result is optimal brood size may be less than two
              juveniles; the second egg may provide insurance against hatching
              failure.

This experiment will provide new insights to the ecological factors
              that influence the life histories of tropical birds.  Birds are important
              components of biodiversity in tropical ecosystems; understanding their life
              histories is important for conservation decisions. Since tropical birds produce
              so few eggs per nesting attempt, any increase in juvenile mortality caused by
              habitat loss or forest fragmentation may be extremely detrimental to the
              persistence of those species.
