Tedesco

Dr. Tedesco will develop a three-dimensional model of
              the asteroid belt consisting of orbital elements, diameters, and albedos for
              all asteroids that can become brighter than apparent visual magnitude 25. This
              model will then be improved using extant and contemporaneous observations at
              visual through infrared wavelengths. The improved model will be used to refine
              our knowledge of the current asteroid size-frequency distribution and to aid in
              planning future observations at those wavelengths that address this issue. 
              Measured albedos for approximately 2,400 asteroids will be used to estimate the
              albedos and diameters for real asteroids lacking them and to generate albedos
              and absolute magnitudes for the statistical asteroids.  This work is funded
              through the Planetary Astronomy Program in the Division of Astronomical
              Sciences.
