DDIG: Controls on carbon cycling in freshwater pelagic ecosystems: New
              insights using natural abundance oxygen isotopes

While our understanding of
              net ecosystem production (photosynthesis minus respiration) is robust,
              scientists have been unable to measure rates of photosynthesis and respiration
              directly.  The investigators performing this research have developed a way to
              measure these rates more accurately. This research will employ a mesocosm
              experiment and a lake survey to examine rates of photosynthesis, respiration,
              and carbon cycling in lakes. In particular, the researchers will examine the
              relative importance of phosphorus enrichment, light availability, and dissolved
              organic carbon supply in regulating these rates.  This research will improve
              our understanding of controls on the functioning of freshwater pelagic
              ecosystems as well as provide insight into the future management of these
              important resources.
