MARK

The Education Development Center is continuing the work of its
              K-12 Mathematics Curriculum Center (MCC), first funded under NSF grant
              ESI-9617783.  The center continues to offer a regular schedule of workshops for
              teams from schools and school districts interested in upgrading their
              mathematics program.  The center also continues to support and disseminate the
              materials already developed and to develop additional materials that support
              the implementation of the supported instructional materials.  The purpose of
              the seminars and the workshops is to assist schools and school districts in
              becoming familiar with the 13 sets of comprehensive instructional materials in
              mathematics developed with NSF support and to understand the issues related to
              the implementation of these materials.   Specifically, the goals of the center
              are to:

Increase awareness of NSF-funded comprehensive instructional
              materials among school districts interested in improving their mathematics
              program.

Increase understanding of the challenges involved in the selection
              and implementation of mathematics curricula developed in response to the NCTM
              Standards.

Provide assistance to schools and districts reviewing and using
              standards-based curricula, paying special attention to issues of transition and
              articulation across grades K-12.

Provide needed resources for school
              systems, including a seminar series and related publications focused on
              standards-based curriculum selection and implementation.

Build capacity
              within districts for making informed choices and decisions regarding selection
              and use of standards-based mathematics materials.
