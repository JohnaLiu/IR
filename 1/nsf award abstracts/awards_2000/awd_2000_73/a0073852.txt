Argentina contains basement rocks that are
              key to understanding Paleozoic evolution of the paleo-Pacific margin of
              Gondwana and the possible relationship of events there to the development of
              the Appalachian margin of Laurentia.  Recent work in the structurally complex
              rocks of Eastern Sierras Pampeanas has produced data in conflict with
              predictions of existing models of the evolution of this margin by a continental
              collision.  This project will test and further investigate the possibility that
              the structures and metamorphic signatures are the result of a continental
              margin/accretionary prism that underwent ridge subduction instead.  Results
              have considerable implications to attempts to reassemble the Gondwana
              supercontinent.
