The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite database
              will be used to develop Near-Infrared (NIR), Mid-Infrared (MIR), and
              Far-Infrared (FIR) light curves of carbon and oxygen-rich Mira stars. These new
              light curves will be compared to visual light curves.  This will provide, for
              the first time, the link between photospheric variations and circumstellar
              shell variations.  At present, MIR or FIR variability has been observed in a
              handful of stars.  Generally, only a small fraction of the visual light curve
              has been sampled. The COBE DIRBE instrument data will be used to provide
              information to increase the sample size dramatically, generally with better
              sampling of the light curve.  This data will be used to search for phase lags
              between the optical and infrared light curves and to search for differences in
              the amplitude of the variations at different wavelengths.  The result of the
              research will be an atlas of infrared light curves of Mira variable stars.  The
              atlas will contain the photometric data as well as estimates of the
              circumstellar parameters.  These results will provide strong constraints on
              current models of dust formation, destruction, and heating in circumstellar
              envelopes.
