Abstract    :
              As the thumb (digit I) is vital for grasping in humans, digit I (like the human
              big toe) in birds is critical for both their perching and holding prey. 
              Despite the importance of digit I to birds, its anatomy, evolution, and
              function have not been studied.  This study will address two primary questions,
              which will lead to a more complete understanding of the avian foot.  First, the
              early evolution of the avian hallux will be investigated through comparisons of
              known avian fossils.  Second, a study of foot function among living birds will
              compare muscle function and force output to lend insights into functional
              factors that may have shaped the evolution of bird feet.
	The evolution of the
              perching foot of birds appears to exemplify a relatively common phenomenon in
              biology, the differentiation of a structural copy.  Having an "extra" copy of a
              structure allows the organism to explore a new functional or behavioral realm
              with one copy while maintaining the primitive function with another.  Thus, a
              better understanding of avian foot evolution will contribute to understanding
              the evolution of other structures as diverse as the human thumb, redundant jaw
              musculature and fish feeding, and gene duplications, all of which are examples
              of this phenomenon.
