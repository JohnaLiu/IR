This US-Argentina project funded by the Division of
              International Programs in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic
              Sciences and the Petrology and Geochemistry Program of the Directorate for
              Geosciences supports Dr. Bernhardt Saini-Eidukat of North Dakota State
              University, Fargo, to work with Drs. Daniel A. Gregori and Ernesto Bjerg at
              Universidad Nacional Del Sur in Argentina on a study of silicic magmatism in
              Northern Patagonia.
This project is a geochronological, geochemical and
              radiogenic isotope study of silicic magmatism in Somoncura region of Northern
              Patagonia in Argentina.  Its primary objective is to place the silicic rocks of
              Somoncura Magmatic Belt in a modern plate tectonic geologic context.
This
              study of the origin of the silicic rocks in southern South America will help
              link these rocks with structural and tectonic studies and is important for
              testing models having a bearing on the break-up of the supercontinent of
              Gondwana. In addition to the PIs, undergraduate students from North Dakota
              State will be involved as well as a graduate student from Argentina. 
              Facilities used will be those at Fargo State, Universidad Nacional del Sur in
              Bahia Blanca, Argentina, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Macalester
              College in Minnesota.
