This project studies the broad question of why
              certain DNA mutations that lead to inherited diseases are so common in the
              present human population.  The study focuses on one particular disease,
              hereditary hemochromatosis, which is caused primarily by the mutation of a
              single DNA base carried by about 1 in 10 individuals of Northern European
              descent. The collection of the DNA differences that exist within and between
              human populations for a region of DNA surrounding the hemochromatosis mutation
              allows the inference of details about the history of this mutation and the gene
              in which it occurs.  The goal of this work is to compare competing models for
              hemochromatosis' prevalence that take into account the role of natural
              selection and demographic history to the actual genetic variation found at this
              locus to determine which models best fit the data.

Because mutations that
              affect the function of genes and lead to inherited disease make up an
              appreciable proportion of human genetic variation, the study of the factors
              affecting their prevalence is relevant for understanding both human genetic
              diversity and health.  These detrimental mutations affect all other forms of
              life, but their study in humans is powerful because modern medicine excels at
              detecting the minor effects of these naturally occurring mutations.
