Abstract    :
              ICME is a new multimedia conference slated to be the major Institute
of
              Electrical & Electronic Engineer's (IEEE) conference on the subject
of
              Multimedia technologies and is to take place in New York City in
July-August
              2000. The conference is meant to deal with the emerging
discipline of
              multimedia processing under the sponsorship of several
IEEE technical
              societies.  This multidisciplinary conference is
expected to deal with
              confluence of several areas ranging from
wireless video, internet, universal
              access of computing devices, joint
audio-video and multimodal processing,
              computer animation, perceptual
human computer interfaces including newly
              emerging standards
technologies.

The funding involves student support by
              providing opportunity for
disssemination of technical information in this
              evolving field for
training and education of graduate students, who are the
              potential
leaders of technlogy workforce of the nearterm as well as longterm
              future.
Specific engineering disciplines addreesed are signal
              processing,
communications and networking, database systems, hardware and
              system
integration for multimedia procesing etc.
