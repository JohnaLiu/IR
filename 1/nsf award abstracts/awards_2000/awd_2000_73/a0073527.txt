Abstract    :
              Most modern single processor architectures focus on exploiting instruction-level
              parallelism. However, despite continued performance improvements, there is
              increasing doubt that aggressive ILP architecture techniques would continue
              bringing the desired improvements and that there will come about a diminishing
              return in the performance of single-chip architectures.

Multithreaded
              execution models promise to exploit thread-level parallelism (TLP) beyond a
              pure ILP approach. Multithreading can be applied directly at the level of
              uniprocessor instruction-set architectures. For example, Simultaneous
              MultiThreading (SMT) is a promising approach, which is attracting the attention
              of a number of academic and industrial research groups. This technique allows
              the various pipelines of a "superscalar" processor to be efficiently utilized
              by scheduling from several "coarse-grain" threads of one (or several)
              program(s). Although exploiting both ILP and TLP is attractive, the following
              questions are investigated in the project:

- Can an architecture model,
              which integrates fine-grain multithreading support with a coarse-grain
              multithreaded architecture model such as SMT, be developed?

- What are the
              design trade-off when mapping these architecture features to single-chip
              implementations?

- What compiling methodology for the proposed architecture
              model would exploit thread-level parallelism at both coarse and fine-grain
              levels?
