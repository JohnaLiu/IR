The University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine &
              Atmospheric Science will operate the R/V Catamaran during 2000 when it becomes
              operational and will replace the R/V Calanus (built 1971) as a general
              oceanographic research vessel in support of NSF-supported research projects. 
              The Catamaran is a 96 ft. vessel, constructed in 1999/2000, and is owned and
              operated by University of Miami.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 146
              operational days during 2000, of which 36 days are in support of NSF-supported
              investigators.  The remaining cruises will support NOAA, Navy, and other
              private projects.  Additional days may be added on to the schedule during the
              year.  The projects scheduled on the Catamaran represent a wide variety of
              oceanographic disciplines and will fully utilize the capabilities of the
              vessel. Cruises include biological work in the Bahamas; geological and swath
              bathymetry work in the Florida Straits and Florida Keys; chemistry and ocean
              optics work in the Bahamas, Florida Keys, and Florida Bay; physical
              oceanography in the Florida Keys and Florida Bay; and equipment/instrumentation
              testing in Florida Bay and the Bahamas.

The R/V Catamaran is part of a fleet
              of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science
              research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to
              be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized
              ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing
              vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships
              specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by
              universities and institutions around the country.
