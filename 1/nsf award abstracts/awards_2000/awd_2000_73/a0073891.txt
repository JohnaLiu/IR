North America experienced tectonism on both east and west
              margins during the Mesozoic, and paleomagnetic data have been instrumental in
              working out past relative plate positions and relative motion.  However, the
              apparent polar wunder path for North America, on which accurate reconstruction
              rely, is basically unresolved for the middle and upper Jurassic.  Data from New
              England suggests that the APWP lies at high latitudes, but data from the
              Colorado Plateau indicates a significantly lower latitude APWP.  This
              discrepancy is important, and remains unresolved because flaws exist in both
              data sets.  This project will attempt to define the APWP for this time interval
              for North America by study of the Sundance and Morrison formations in the Black
              Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota that may have escaped the rotations and
              overprints affecting other regions.  Results will help anchor poles of middle
              to upper Jurassic age for cratonic North America so that several tectonic
              questions can be better addressed.
