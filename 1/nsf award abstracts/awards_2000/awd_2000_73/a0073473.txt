Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to investigate and evaluate innovative
              hardware-based approaches to reducing misses in multiprocessor caches due to
              interference.  Interference between cache lines in a multiprocessor can cause
              lines to be involuntarily relinquished while they are still in the working set
              of a computation.  The problem is especially serious for modified lines, which
              not only account for a large percentage of cache misses, but also incur a high
              miss penalty.

The fundamental idea in this research is to record the lines
              that a cache has given up involuntarily, and use them as prefetching targets. 
              Simulation studies based on transaction processing and scientific workloads
              will be carried out to evaluate several algorithms for prefetch selection. 
              These algorithms include intuitive approaches that take advantage of coherence
              transactions, as well as more aggressive approaches in which processes that
              modify a cache line notify other processes to prefetch that line.
