The Tian Shan intracontinental mountain range related to the
              Indian-Eurasian collision has been studied to understand the dynamic processes
              responsible for this type of orogenesis.  However, the timing and short-term
              versus long-term rates of deformation are controversial, leading to models in
              which deformation in Tian Shan may have accelerated significantly in the last
              few millions of years.  A goal of this study is to test these models by
              providing new constraints derived from growth strata analysis on the rate of
              deformation in Tian Shan over different timescales.  Results will be applicable
              to understanding the Indian-Eurasian collision and should contribute to models
              of such collisions generally.
