Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to investigate the design, implementation, and
              performance evaluation of a new architecture for storage area networks.  The
              architecture under investigation, Distributed RAID and Locatin Independent
              Caching (DRALIC) will implement distributed RAID and global caching at the
              device level, using the embedded controllers in storage devices to perform
              complex functions.  A preliminary study has shown that this architecture has
              significant performance and reliability advantages in web server applications. 
              The present project includes detailed simulation studies and a proof-of-concept
              implementation on a network of general-purpose computers.
