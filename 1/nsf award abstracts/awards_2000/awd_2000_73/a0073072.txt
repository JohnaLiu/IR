Microorganisms play an important role in the biology of many
              insects, with
effects ranging from mutualistic to pathogenic.  Bacteria of
              several types
are found in some but not other individual aphids sampled from
              natural
populations. These bacteria are transmitted from mother to daughter,
              and
thus--if they affect the host phenotype--are a source of heritable
              
variation between aphids. The goal of this research is to assess: (a)
              the
transmission of these bacteria, (b) their fitness effects, and (c)
              their
role in aphid adaptation. Specifically, this work will measure variation
              in
the presence of symbionts across aphid populations, their rate
              of
transmission, the heritability of symbiont abundance, and the
              relationship
between symbiont abundance and aphid fitness. A long-term
              selection
experiment will be conducted to investigate the role of symbionts in
              host
plant adaptation.

Although heritable microorganisms are commonly found
              in insects, their
effects on host fitness are generally unknown. This study
              will contribute
to understanding the role of such organisms in the biology of
              aphids, an
important insect pest. Additionally, this study is significant and
              unique
in that it uses the aphid-symbiont community as a model for
              understanding 
interactions between selection acting at different levels:
              among aphids
with different symbiont communities, and among bacteria within
              individual
aphids.
