This project will test Greenberg's cognitive-linguistic
              theory of kinship universals, an extension of Hage and Harary's research on
              lattice structures in the evolution of kinship systems. The objective is to
              discover, using models from graph theory, cross-cultural and historical marking
              relations in systems of kinship classification. The researchers will show that
              lexical universals are found in the domain of kinship just as they are in the
              domains of color and ethnobiology. The research will demonstrate the necessity
              of using comparative linguistic data to determine the direction of change in
              kinship terminologies and the value of such data in elucidating, through
              controlled comparison, their sociological determinants. The discovery of
              convergent developments in kinship systems belonging to different linguistic
              families can then be used to evaluate theories concerning the evolution of
              kinship systems in general. The discovery of marking asymmetries in kinship
              terminologies will have important implications for problems of typology and for
              the reconstruction of prehistoric kinship systems. This project will contribute
              scientific knowledge in cultural anthropology through the discovery and
              explanation of lawful regularities in kinship, the most basic of all human
              classification systems.
