Knoll and Okusu
Graduate student Akiko Okusu, under the direction of
              Dr. Andrew Knoll, Harvard University, is studying the phylogenetic
              relationships and the evolution of calcareous hard parts of aplacophoran and
              polyplacophoran molluscs using integrated data from DNA sequences, morphology,
              and embryology.  Aplacophorans are worm-like deep-sea molluscs that have no
              shells but are covered by spicules made of the calcium carbonate mineral
              aragonite.  Polyplacophorans (chitons) are flat elongate molluscs with eight
              dorsal shell-plates imbricated within a spicule-embedded mantle girdle.  It has
              been postulated that aplacophorans are closely related to polyplacophorans,
              that the two groups represent the most basal groups of molluscs (based on their
              relatively simple features), and that their aragonite spicules reflect a more
              "primitive" type of calcium carbonate deposition than that found in other
              molluscs.  However, the evolutionary relationships of the Aplacophora and the
              Polyplacophora are unresolved.  The lack of a well-supported phylogeny calls
              into question hypotheses of evolutionary changes in molluscan form and mineral
              deposition.  Molecular sequence data from highly conserved nuclear coding
              genes, EF1-alpha and POL-II, will be used to construct a phylogenetic framework
              for 40 taxa including representative species from major molluscan classes and
              outgroup species from the Sipuncula and Annelida.  Spicule development and
              morphology in these groups will be analyzed within the phylogenetic framework
              in order to assess homology and pattern of evolutionary change.  The results
              will have a major impact on our understanding of the origin and evolution of
              molluscs.
