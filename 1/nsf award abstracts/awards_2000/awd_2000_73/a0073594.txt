The Materials Research Society organizes a symposium titled
              "Materials Science and Engineering Education in the New Millennium" at its
              April 2000 meeting in San Francisco.  The symposium focus is undergraduate
              materials science and engineering education, including both materials science
              and engineering degree programs and the role of materials courses and
              experiences in other undergraduate degree programs.  There is also an
              international perspective to this symposium.

The symposium reaches an
              audience of education professionals beyond the Materials Research Society's
              membership, and especially seeks to bring in faculty from community colleges,
              undergraduate institutions and engineering technology programs.
