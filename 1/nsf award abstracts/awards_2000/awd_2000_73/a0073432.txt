Forensic DNA analysis has revolutionized our ability to
              identify individuals based on small amounts of genetic material. Similar
              technology offers a valuable new tool for studying the genetics of wild
              populations with an unprecedented degree of precision. A novel technique
              developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will be used to determine the
              parentage and dispersal of offspring in a tropical forest bird (Manacus
              manacus). By comparing the DNA fingerprints of this species in different
              environments, geographic influences on dispersal of these birds can be
              ascertained, thus realizing the goals of this study.  These goals are:  to
              determine (1) relatedness among the birds, (2) how far they and their offspring
              disperse, and (3) to what extent populations have diverged from each other.
              

This investigation addresses directly the fundamental questions of whether
              topography limits dispersal and if so, whether more variable landscapes lead to
              genetically more distinct populations. The methodology of the study is
              applicable to any species, including humans, and provides information crucial
              to recognizing and meeting threats to species that arise from habitat
              alteration. Therefore, the project outcome will serve as a model for the
              recognition of species-at-risk and for the subsequent design of protected
              areas.
