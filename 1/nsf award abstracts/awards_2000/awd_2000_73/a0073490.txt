                                      Abstract
   This research will improve the decoding of
              error-control codes, in
particular, Reed-Solomon codes, which are essential in
              most advanced modern
communication and storage systems, ranging from deep
              space communication to 
optical and magnetic storage systems, such as the
              compact disk and CD-ROM.
By developing decoders that operate at lower signal
              to noise ratios, this
research will allow the recovery of data and records
              that currently are
unreadable.
   This research will develop an efficient
              soft decoding algorithm that 
will significantly outperform GMD-based decoding
              algorithms. The algorithm
is based on Sudan's list decoding technique that
              produces a list of 
tentative codewords and it shows a number of very
              interesting features.
Among the most intriguing characteristics of the
              algorithm is a complexity
and performance that can be traded freely within
              certain fundamental
limits. Hence, the coding gain provided by the
              Reed-Solomon code can be
traded on the fly for complexity in any application
              with the maximal
list size changing accordingly.
