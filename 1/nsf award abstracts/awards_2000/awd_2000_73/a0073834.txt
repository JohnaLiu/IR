The terminal Proterozoic to Cambrian Nama Group of Namibia is
              one of the most comprehensive records of end Proterozoic events.  The
              Schwarzrand Subgroup of the Nama Group contains 15 stratigraphically distinct
              volcanic ash beds, which are constrained by U-Pb geochronology to a time span
              of at most 6 m.y.  These event beds have tremendous chronostratigraphic value
              as high-resolution, widespread, time-parallel layers.  This feasibility study
              will evaluate the potential for using geochemical fingerprinting techniques to
              uniquely identify and correlate ash beds in the Schwarzrand Suybgroup. 
              Correlations of some widespread ash beds are already well established based on
              the physical stratigraphy.  Whole rock and fluid inclusion studies of samples
              from these beds will control for within bed variability of chemical signature. 
              Three widely separated, complete sections of the Schwarzrand Subgroup preserve
              nearly all the ash beds in replicate.  Comprehensive analyses of ash bed
              samples from these sections ill compare between bed vs. within bed
              compositional differences and will test the resolution of the fingerprinting
              method.
