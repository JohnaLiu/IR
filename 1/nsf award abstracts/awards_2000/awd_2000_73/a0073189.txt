Abstract    :
              DDIG: Grassland Response to Precipitation Manipulation

Across the Great
              Plains region of North America, water availability is a primary determinant of
              plant productivity.  However, the importance of water availability to plant
              production varies across the different plant communities that span this region.
               In the semi-arid western region, the shortgrass steppe community is primarily
              water limited, but in the sub-humid eastern tallgrass prairie, water, nitrogen,
              and light co-limit plant production.  Current climate change scenarios predict
              decreased summer precipitation, increased summer temperatures, and increased
              variability in both the amounts and timing of rainfall for this region.  This
              project will explore the capability of the short-, mixed, and tallgrass
              prairies to respond to changes in precipitation amounts.  Specifically, the
              investigators will measure how varying precipitation affects carbon and
              nitrogen cycling within these communities.
