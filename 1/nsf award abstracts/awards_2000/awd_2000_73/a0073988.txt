Investigations of the geodynamo process that is
              responsible for generation of the Earth's magnetic field are proposed. The
              following areas will be addressed: 1. Investigation of the basic underlying
              mechanisms of magnetic field generation in recent numerical models of the
              geodynamo. 2. Investigation of the parameter regime of numerical dynamo models,
              seeking in particular to further our understanding of the role of inertial and
              viscous effects on the geodynamo. 3. Investigation of thermal core-mantle
              interactions and their role in controlling the morphology of the main field and
              its secular variation. 4. Investigation of the effect of inner core
              gravitational coupling on the geodynamo. 5. Analysis of features observed in
              maps of the magnetic at the core-mantle boundary using a numerical dynamo
              model. 6. Analysis of the frozen-flux approximation. 7. Dynamo code
              development, including development of a distributed memory version of the code
              suitable for running on a network of Intel x86 based machines, and initial
              development of a community dynamo model.
