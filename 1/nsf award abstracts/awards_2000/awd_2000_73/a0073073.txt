Abstract    :
              Herbivores must combat the chemical arsenal of their host plants in order to
              feed.  Our understanding of such resistance is incomplete.  In North Carolina,
              a small (1cm) marine herbivore (the shrimp-like Ampithoe) performs well on
              Dictyota, a brown seaweed containing alcohols toxic to other herbivores. 
              Ampithoe's geographic range is larger than the plants', and previous work shows
              populations which are outside Dictyota's range do not perform as well as
              populations within Dictyota's range.  The proposed research will identify plant
              compounds responsible for mediating these differences in performance.  This
              will allow the identification of biochemical resistance mechanisms that respond
              to the toxins. These known host use patterns will be placed into a
              within-species phylogenetic framework using DNA sequence data. The work will
              serve as an example for other plant-herbivore systems whose host-use is known
              and recent evolutionary history is unknown. One can test theory largely
              developed for terrestrial insect pests using an ecologically similar herbivore
              from a very different environment (i.e., marine vs. terrestrial) and
              evolutionary history (i.e., Crustacea vs. Insecta).  Such tests can lead to
              alternatives to current theory and a more complete understanding of how
              herbivores may respond to plants over ecological and evolutionary timescales.
