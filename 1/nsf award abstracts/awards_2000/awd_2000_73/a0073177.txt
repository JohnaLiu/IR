Many species are currently undergoing drastic
              reductions in population size due to human activities.  Such reductions, termed
              "population bottlenecks", subject populations to multiple hazards.  These
              include both short-term demographic risks, such as a disease or natural
              disaster, and long term genetic effects of small size, like  loss of variation
              due to inbreeding.  The penguin genus Spheniscus is an appropriate system for
              studying the genetic effects of population bottlenecks because it comprises two
              endangered species of penguin that have undergone repeated bottleneck events
              (Galapagos Penguin, Humboldt Penguin), and two species that have not undergone
              these fluctuations (Magellanic Penguin, African Penguin).  The bottlenecks are
              caused by both anthropogenic impacts and environmental changes during El Nino
              events, which can reduce populations by up to 77%.  This project proposes to
              test bottleneck theories by comparing genetic variation using molecular genetic
              techniques.  This research will not harm penguins; only a few drops of blood or
              one feather from each bird is sufficient.

An understanding of the effects of
              bottleneck events on small populations may be critical to their long-term
              survival.  Genetic variation is necessary for future evolutionary potential and
              population persistence.  This study will directly compare the genetic effects
              of population fluctuations to population stability using the penguin genus
              Spheniscus.  The results may be of direct value to the conservation of many
              endangered species.
