Abstract    :
              Maternal effects occur when a female modifies her offspring in a manner not
              attributable solely to the offspring's genes. Often these effects are
              influenced by the ecological environment of the mother, but how ecological
              conditions are transmitted through the mother to her offspring are poorly
              understood. This proposal involves the investigation of the hormonal mechanisms
              by which mother birds modify the avian embryo's hormonal milieu according to
              food availability in the maternal environment.  Preliminary findings in the
              American kestrel indicate that food availability influences the laying female's
              blood-plasma levels of the hormone prolactin, that her plasma prolactin
              influences how much androgen hormone she deposits in her egg yolks, and that
              yolk androgens affect offspring survival. However, it is not known if food
              affects yolk androgen levels. In this proposal, food availability will be
              manipulated to determine how it affects yolk androgen levels.
Maternal effects
              are ubiquitous in nature, occurring in numerous plant species, insects, and all
              classes of vertebrates. This study may reveal a mechanism by which ecological
              conditions such as food availability may be transduced to the avian embryo. A
              mechanistic link from the environment, through the mother, and to the offspring
              has been described in few if any organisms.
