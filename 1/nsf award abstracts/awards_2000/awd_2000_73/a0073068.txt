Invasions by wood shrubs (particularly those that fix
              nitrogen) into grasslands have received much attention, yet we do not
              understand the role that N-fixation plays in the invasion process.  In
              particular, we do not know what constraints may be imposed by soil-borne
              mutualists on fixation efficiency, nor the degree to which nutrient limitation
              of the resident community contributes to the competitive advantage of
              N-fixation.  This research will investigate three questions that address
              constraints on a nitrogen-fixing shrub's ability to invade a coastal California
              grassland habitat, and the consequences of that fixation for resident species
              interactions: (1) How does the success of colonization by broom into grassland
              habitat change with nutrient limitation of the resident species? (2) How does
              availability or quality of Rhizobium innoculum affect this species" ability to
              invade and fix nitrogen? (3) How does enrichment of soil by N-fixation affect
              species interactions?  Coastal California grasslands offer an ideal opportunity
              to perform this research because they lack a significant native N-fixing
              component, are themselves nitrogen limited, and are currently experiencing
              dramatic invasions by several introduced N-fixing shrubs.
