This award will support the costs of travel for 10 US
              graduate students currently doing research on volcanological problems to ensure
              their attendance at the IAVCEI  (International Association of Volcanology and
              Chemistry of the Earth's Interior) General Assembly in Bali, Indonesia, July
              2000.  The meeting has a theme of volcanic hazard mitigation, and the
              attendance of US volcanology students will help stimulate continued
              international collaborative research on volcanology, and to develop more
              interactions among US volcanology programs.  Selection of the students will be
              done from applications by an AGU committee.  Students selected must be enrolled
              in a US university and doing active research in volcanology as evidenced by a
              submitted abstract to the IAVCEI meeting in Bali.  As part of the experience,
              students will also participate in field trips to at least two other active
              volcanoes in the Philippines and Hawaii.
