This research program involves experimental
              investigations at high pressures and temperatures that address the properties
              and behavior of rare-element minerals (i.e., ac-cessory minerals) in the
              Earth's crust.  Accessory minerals - for example, zircon (ZrSiO4), apatite
              (Ca5[PO4]3F), monazite (CePO4), xenotime (YPO4), titanite (CaTiSiO5), and
              rutile (TiO2)-are the principal hosts of radioactive isotopes (e.g., of U, Th,
              Lu, Sm) and their decay products (e.g., isotopes of Pb, Hf, Nd) and also of
              trace elements such as the rare earths that are useful in deciphering
              geochemical processes.  The research con-ducted under this grant is aimed at
              learning how these minerals participate in melting processes and metamorphic
              reactions, and how effectively they retain radiometric age in-formation and
              stable isotope ratios.  Several types of experiments and measurements are
              conducted in order to characterize:  1) ionic diffusion in accessory minerals
              (e.g., of oxy-gen, Pb, Th and REE); and 2) solubility of zircon in silicic
              magmas and pelagic sediment-derived melts in subduction environments.  We are
              also exploring cathodoluminescence (CL) as a means of semi-quantitative mapping
              of trace-element distribution in experi-mental samples.  The intended
              long-range impact of the work is to enhance the ability of geochemists to
              understand and model the processes that redistribute the chemical elements in
              the Earth's crust.
