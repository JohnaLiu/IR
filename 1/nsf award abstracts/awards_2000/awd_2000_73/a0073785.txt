     The investigator designs effective algorithms to
              identify

epistatic effects that contribute to a complex
              quantitative

phenotype.  The algorithms apply to datasets that, for
              each

individual in a sample, identifies alleles at a fixed set of

markers
              along with the value of the quanitative trait.  The

algorithms seek an
              optimum fit for the phenotype as a sum of

epistatic effects.  The approach
              is to perform repeated searches

for an optimum fit in the space of all
              possible combinations of

effects.  The search utilizes random walk
              hill-climbing

techniques.  These hill-climbs are adaptive in the sense
              that

certain parameters, which control the choice of steps in the

random
              walks, evolve based on the outcomes of previous walks.

     It is widely
              accepted that the genetic components of most

interesting quantitative traits
              (eg. blood pressure, height)

involve interactions between many genes.  So,
              computational

methods to infer the genetic basis of quantitative traits
              must

include an analysis of epistatic effects, i.e., instances where

the
              choice of allele at two or more genetic markers influences

the value of the
              quantitative trait in ways that are different

from the sum of the effects of
              the individual alleles.  In this

project the investigator develops
              computational methods to

identify these epistatic effects by a process of
              doing repeated

searches through the space of possible effects looking for
              ones

that explain a significant amount of the variation of the
              trait.

These searches are self-educating in the sense that later

searches
              learn from earlier searches.  As the number of searches

increases, the
              adaptive mechanism focuses the search on

particularly strong epistatic
              effects.
