Abstract    :
              INT-0073906

This is a planning visit proposal for Professor Wesley M. Shrum,
              of the Department of Sociology at Louisiana State University, to travel to
              Ghana, Kenya, and India, to meet with his counterparts for the purpose of
              finalizing plans for a collaborative project on the development and assessment
              of the Web-based research capacity in each of these countries.  Professor Shrum
              will meet with Professor J. Opare, at the University of Cape Coast in Ghana;
              Mr. J. de Smedt at MSF-Spain (an NGO) in Kenya; and Professor R. Sooryamoorthy,
              at the Loyola College of Social Sciences in India.   

Web communications are
              being introduced or expanded in many developing countries, including Ghana,
              Kenya, and India.  Data will be collected and analyzed on the interpersonal
              networking patterns and information search behaviors of soil scientists in
              selected governmental and academic research institutions.  The results will be
              used to assess the current and future impact of the Web on scientific and
              technological capacity in developing countries
