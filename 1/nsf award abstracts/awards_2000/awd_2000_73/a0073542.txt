This project focuses on the population dynamics
              and genetics of an annual marine plant species, a kelp commonly known as the
              Sea Palm (Postelsia palmaeformis). The Sea Palm is an annual alga that grows in
              the Pacific Northwest. It appears in the early spring and dies off each fall.
              Population locations and sizes vary dramatically from year to year. This
              research studies how these populations are related along the coast and through
              time. Individuals' locations have been mapped using computerized surveying
              equipment over the last two years. Concurrently, tissue samples have been
              collected for genetic analysis. DNA markers will be used to reveal the
              relationship of individuals found in a single year within a population, between
              two or more populations, and between populations from one year to the
              next.

Studying population dynamics through space and time allows us to
              understand how populations are interconnected. This understanding provides
              insight into what is otherwise unknowable for many organisms, namely where
              individuals come from and how they interact with each other. DNA markers allow
              us to estimate the genetic diversity of populations (i.e., the "genetic health"
              of a species). Results of such studies are of fundamental scientific interest
              and may be applied in managing and conserving living resources in coastal
              regions.
