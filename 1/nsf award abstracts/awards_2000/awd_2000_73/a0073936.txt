Long Valley caldera, California, is an
              ideal natural laboratory for the study of interaction between volcanism and
              tectonics. The Hilton Block - the area in the Sierra Nevada located south of
              Long Valley caldera - has been one of the most seismically active regions in
              California. However, patterns of recent seismicity are difficult to reconcile
              with the observed regional strain or with stress transfer calculated from
              simple elastic models of volcanic inflation. Understanding the connections
              between volcanism and tectonics in this region will require a better
              understanding of both the kinematics of the Hilton Block and the mechanics of
              stress transfer within the caldera system. The investigators will use detailed
              GPS observations and simple elastic models to determine the nature and
              distribution of deformation in the Hilton Block. They will develop finite
              element models that address time- and temperature-dependent viscoelastic
              effects to further explore how deformation within the seismically active Hilton
              Block is linked to Long Valley volcanism.
