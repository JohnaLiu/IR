The plan is to conduct 3D particle tracking velocimetry
              experiments in porous media with imbedded heterogeneities by using a
              world-class apparatus to extend previous work to study velocity fields and
              dispersion in homogeneous porous media to simple heterogeneous systems with
              varied sizes and shapes of particles.  The exeriments to observe two-particle
              correlations are being conducted at a world-class facility in Italy by a
              post-doc.  The PI is working out a strategy to develop (non-local) dispersion
              theories applicable to heterogeneous media.  This funding is to augment and
              sustain work at a facility that would otherwise be closed down soon.
