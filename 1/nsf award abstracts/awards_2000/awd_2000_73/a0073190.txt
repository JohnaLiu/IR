This research examines the behavioral ecology and reproductive
              performance of intercontinental landbird migrants arriving at high latitude
              breeding grounds.  The connection between migration and reproduction is being
              assessed by examining the role body condition plays as migrants arrive and
              begin to breed in northern Michigan.  Birds are captured on arrival, condition
              assessed, and then released and subsequently relocated in order to examine the
              influence of arrival condition on both behavior and reproductive
              performance.

The life history of many organisms is characterized by an
              annual cycle: breeding season, migration, nonbreeding season, migration and so
              on.  Although researchers acknowledge that events during one phase of this
              cycle influence survival and/or reproductive success during subsequent phases,
              seldom is the relationship between phases studied.  This work is unique in its
              explicit focus on this linkage.  Moreover, while both winter and breeding
              seasons are argued to be major periods of population limitation, the influence
              of migration remains unknown.  Results of this work have implications in
              understanding the relative importance of this period as a factor in limiting
              populations of migrating organisms.  Finally, these results will provide
              insight into what constitutes suitable stopover habitat and how a bird's
              ability to locate en route habitat impacts future reproductive performance. 
              This knowledge is critical given the recent declines in many populations of
              these birds.
