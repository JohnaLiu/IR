Abstract    :
              The PI's will study how predation by stream fish will affect survivorship
              antipredator behavior,  and larval growth of salamander larvae.  The will
              investigate how predation as a spatially explicity and variable selective agent
              may be differentiating sub-populations of the salamander Desmognathus
              quadramaculatus.  This species co-exists with stream fish in southern
              Appalachian streams and this work will provide a unique test case to ask if
              predation influences life history traits in animals with complex life cycles.
