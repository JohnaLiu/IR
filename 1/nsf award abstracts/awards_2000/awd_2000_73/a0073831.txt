Abstract    :
              The late Archean (ca. 2.7 Ga) is characterized by widespread occurrence of 13
              C-depleted kerogens which suggests microbial methane recycling was a dominant
              process in the global carbon cycle.  In addition, available molecular and
              isotopic observations for this time suggest that aerobic organisms were
              present, possibly supported by oxygenated microenvironments within a variety of
              depositional systems.  We propose to evaluate relationships among depositional
              environments and biogeocheniical signatures recorded in late Archean organic
              matter for core and outcrop samples of the Tumbiana and Jeerinah Formation and
              equivalent units in the Pilbara Craton in Western Australia.  Our approach
              integrates sedimentological and stratigraphic observations with analyses of
              molecular and kerogen isotopic and chemical properties.  We will provide
              observations linking depositional environmental conditions with molecular and
              isotopic signatures of ancient life and will attempt to test the importance of
              environmental control on microbial ecosystems and carbon and oxygen cycling on
              the early Earth.
