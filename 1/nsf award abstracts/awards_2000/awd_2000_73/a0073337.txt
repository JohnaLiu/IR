Abstract    :
              Female carpenter bees often reproduce alone, but some individuals form pairs and
              reproduce cooperatively.  A puzzling division of labor occurs in these pairs:
              one female does all the foraging and lays most or all of the eggs, while the
              other female guards the nest.  Why does a guard help another female to
              reproduce, while forgoing her own reproduction?  And why does a reproductive
              forager allow an apparently unrelated female to live in her nest?  This study
              will use field observations, behavioral experiments, and genetic analyses to
              address these questions.

Carpenter-bee nests are excavated in solid wood;
              they are expensive, but durable.  A female who inherits a nest (rather than
              building one) may save valuable time and energy.  This study will ask whether
              guards preferentially join nests that they seem likely to inherit.  The
              question is of general interest because resource inheritance has been shown to
              favor the formation of social groups in birds and mammals; this study may
              produce the first convincing evidence that resource inheritance has similar
              effects on the social systems of insects.  More generally, this study will
              increase basic factual knowledge of North American carpenter bees which remain
              poorly known despite their large size and striking beauty.
