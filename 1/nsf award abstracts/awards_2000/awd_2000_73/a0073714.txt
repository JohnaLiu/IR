              ABSTRACT

OCE-0073714
 
A growing interest in using silicon isotopes to
              study the global silicon cycle in both aquatic and terrestrial environments has
              emerged.  Rare heavy isotopes of silicon have been used as tracers to study
              silica production and dissolution rates in the sea for over two decades.  More
              recently, natural variations in isotopes of silicon have been developed as a
              tool for examining silica cycling in both marine and terrestrial systems. 
              Progress in the use of isotopes of silicon as tools to better understand the
              global silica cycle has been slow due to the small number of investigators who
              have access to a mass spectrometer capable of analyzing isotopes of silicon. 
              For this reason, the PI, a renowned leader in the development of silicon
              isotope capabilities, plans to establish a state-of-the-art facility for the
              analysis of silicon isotopes through the acquisition of a magnet-sector ratio
              mass spectrometer with a custom dual triple-collector and dual sample inlet
              system.   Availability of this facility will allow the scientific community to
              make high precision measurements on silica dissolution rates and determine the
              natural abundance levels.
