Abstract    :
              Embedded systems comprising many interconnected microprocessor-based controllers
              play an increasingly important role in daily life.  They are typically
              systems-on-a-chip (SOCs), which are customized for complex applications, and
              are required to be inexpensive, available and safe.  A key characteristic of
              SOCs is their extensive use and reuse of standard hardware and software modules
              referred to as intellectual property (IP).  This project investigates the basic
              properties and design requirements of IP-based embedded systems that have
              stringent safety and availability goals.  It focuses on the problems of
              low-cost monitoring of system operation in real time to ensure that prescribed
              design objectives are met.
