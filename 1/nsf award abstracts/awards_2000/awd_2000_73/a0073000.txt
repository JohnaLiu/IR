Abstract    :
              This US-Brazil award supported by the Division of International Programs and the
              Division of Mathematical Sciences provides funding for a workshop to be held in
              conjunction with the International Symposium on Dynamical Systems to be held at
              the Instituto de Matematica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
              July, 2000. The U.S. organizer is Dr. Sheldon E. Newhouse of Michigan State
              University; the Brazilian coordinator is Dr. Marcelo Viana of IMPA.  This award
              will fund participation of U.S. mathematicians in both activities, as well as
              cover expenses for the organization of the workshop.

The workshop will bring
              together researchers in the area of dynamical systems from all over the world. 
              The field of dynamical systems impacts many areas, such as physics, biology,
              economics and chemistry.  Some of the topics to be discussed are homoclinic
              bifurcations and the structure of general smooth dynamical systems; dynamics of
              rational maps of the Riemann sphere and polynomial diffeomorphisms in
              n-dimensional real and complex spaces; and strange attractors for smooth
              systems.
