Abstract    :
              This study integrates the biomechanics and physiology of animal locomotion.  The
              link between the mechanics and metabolic cost of walking is poorly understood,
              particularly in quadrupedal animals.  The overall objective is to understand
              the biomechanical basis for the metabolic cost of quadrupedal walking. 
              Specifically, what are the mechanical and metabolic bases for the preferred
              walking speed and the walk-trot transition speed?  This study will focus on one
              species, the domestic horse, because it provides a 13-fold adult size range
              with excellent experimental controls.  The mechanical work and metabolic cost
              of locomotion will be measured in different sized horses (70 kg to 900 kg) over
              a range of walking and slow trotting speeds.
Studying an extreme size range of
              horses will provide unique insight into general mechanisms governing animal
              locomotion.  Understanding the relationship between body size, preferred speed,
              and the metabolic cost of walking has important implications for determining
              the energy budgets of migratory animals and other animals where habitats are
              reduced and resources are becoming increasingly fragmented.  Furthermore, the
              biomechanical analyses would provide valuable insight into the neuromuscular
              control of locomotion and may aid in the design and control of walking robots. 
              The proposed research will allow for more informed diagnosis and treatment of
              horses with musculo-skeletal injuries and could improve horse health by
              providing a broader database to understand the effects of body size on the
              daily energy requirements in exercising horses.
