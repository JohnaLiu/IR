William Kazez

Kazez proposes to study genuine laminations of
              3-manifolds.  
He and his collaborator, D. Gabai, are interested in
              understanding 
the geometry of the universal cover of a manifold containing a
              
genuine lamination, and in particular how it is related to the 
geometry of
              the leaves of the lamination.  He also proposes to 
study representations of
              order trees.  Kazez along with 
K. Honda and G. Matic seek to understand the
              construction of 
tight contact structures from the point of view of a sutured
              
manifold decomposition.  For fibred knots with pseudo-Anosov 
monodromy, the
              sutured manifold decompositions are quite simple, 
and they propose to study
              the classification problem in this 
setting.

Kazez, along with his
              collaborators, proposes to study the 
interaction and relationships between
              foliations and contact structures.  Both structures are a study of a family of
              two 
planes in a 3-dimensional space, but these families appear 
to be
              extremely different.  One is everywhere integrable, 
that is tangent to an
              embedded surface, the other is nowhere integrable.  In spite of this, as the
              ambient space is split 
along surfaces, deep relationships start to become
              apparent.  
It is these relationships that we intend to develop and exploit.
