Abstract    :
              Dramatic advances in the technologies, coupled with economic factors, have given
              rise to a new modality of parallel computing wherein workstations are connected
              together to act cooperatively as a single parallel computer - a Network of
              Workstations (NOW). Many algorithmic devices that ensured efficient
              interprocessor communication and coordination in a tightly coupled parallel
              computing environment no longer guarantee efficiency within a NOW. This project
              derives theoretical understanding of factors that enhance - and detract from -
              efficiency of parallel computing in NOWs. It also develops algorithmic
              techniques that translate such understanding into practically efficient
              scheduling strategies. The scheduling algorithms that emerge from research will
              provide provably predictable performance for large, significant classes of
              computations, such as those that arise in many scientific applications.
