Abstract    :
              Wild animals are often well-equipped to handle variable, harsh environments. 
              Interestingly, most wild animals also will acquire parasites during their
              lives.  Some parasites kill their host, but others cause a chronic, sub-lethal
              infection.  The PIs goal is to determine if chronic, sub-lethal parasite
              infection affects host physiology and consequently host reproduction.  The PIs
              will examine 1) host intestinal physiology and energy allocation (glucose
              absorption, fat and lean masses), 2) host reproduction (litter production,
              offspring masses), and 3) growth and survival of host offspring (linear growth
              measures, body mass).

The broader significance of this project spans several
              research areas.  First, this project has implications for the field of
              life-history evolution because it will determine if an infected host's
              reproduction is constrained by its ability to acquire or process energy. 
              Second, because this research uses wild, rather than laboratory, mice it will
              aid in the understanding of how wild animals cope with chronic infections that
              may alter multiple aspects of reproduction. Third, this research will provide
              much needed empirical data for mathematical models of how sub-lethal parasites
              affect host reproduction.  Finally, because chronic parasite infection of
              humans is common in third world countries, this research may help understand
              the effects of sub-lethal parasites on human reproduction.
