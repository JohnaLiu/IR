DDIG: Relationships among species diversity,
              site fertility, resource heterogeneity, and ecosystem productivity in plant
              communities  

Ecosystem productivity, the rate at which organisms produce
              biomass, is the basic currency for all of humanity's food, fiber, and fuel.  
              Recently, ecosystem productivity has been shown to be influenced by the number
              of species an ecosystem contains.  However, productivity is also influenced by
              environmental factors such as soil fertility, and the influence of species
              diversity on productivity within the context of a range of environmental
              conditions is unknown.  This issue is particularly important because in many
              ecosystems, both species diversity and the underlying environment are changing
              rapidly in response to human influence.  In this research, the investigators
              will conduct a set of field experiments to assess the relative influences of
              plant species diversity and soil fertility on ecosystem productivity.  In
              addition, the work includes experiments to manipulate environmental
              heterogeneity (specifically, the patchiness of soil resources) to examine
              whether the influence of species diversity on ecosystem productivity is
              enhanced by environmental complexity.
