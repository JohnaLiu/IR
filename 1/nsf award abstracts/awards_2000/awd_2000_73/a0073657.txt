This
              research project assembles a team at two campuses to work on
string theory and
              related geometry.  The project is led by two
mathematicians and a physicist,
              and the award supports
postdoctoral research fellows, graduate students, and
              the
collaborations and communications of a broadly based research
network. 
              The research program supported by this award
concentrates on dualities in
              string theory and M theory, a topic
in which a broad range of geometric and
              physical concepts come
together.  The best known of these dualities is mirror
              symmetry,
which has had dramatic consequences for algebraic and
              symplectic
geometry, and this project intends to explore new dualities
              and
constraints along with mirror symmetry.

String theory is a promising
              candidate for a unifying theory of
the universe at its most fundamental
              levels.  The basic idea is
simple - elementary particles should be modeled as
              mathematical
loops of string rather than as points - but working out
              the
details of this theory has involved and inspired some
sophisticated
              mathematical tools and ideas.  Constraints and
observations from physics,
              sometimes posed as a claim that two
distinct geometries must generate the same
              physical theory, can
have large numbers of consequences for geometry since
              quantities
of physical interest are often expressed as the average value
              of
an observable quantity over space, or as a way of counting the
number of
              times two objects meet.  The program in Algebra, Number
Theory, and
              Combinatorics is cofunding this award.
