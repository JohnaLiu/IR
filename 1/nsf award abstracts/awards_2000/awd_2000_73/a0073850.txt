The proposed research is an experimental
              investigation of the reactivity of organic acids at conditions pertinent to
              geologic environments. Organic acids are frequently the most abundant dissolved
              organic compounds in geologic fluids, and have been implicated to play a
              significant role in a number of geologic processes including the generation and
              migration of oil and natural gas, transportation of metals in ore-forming
              solutions,  evolution of porosity in sedimentary basins, weathering, and
              subsurface geomicrobial activities.  Previous attempts to evaluate
              decomposition rates of acetic acid and other
organic acids have left large
              uncertainties in the behavior of these compounds under geologic conditions. 
              These uncertainties will be addressed in the proposed research through a new
              experimental approach that involves a better reaction apparatus and a more
              comprehensive analysis of reaction products.  Specific issues to be addressed
              include:
(1) the relative contributions of decarboxylation and oxidation to
              the thermal decomposition of acetate and longer chain carboxylic acids, (2) the
              impact of chemical environment (oxidation state, pH, presence of dissolved
              sulfur compounds) on which decomposition pathway predominates,  (3) whether CO2
              and acetate can attain a state of
metastable thermodynamic equilibrium under
              some circumstances,  (4) whether condensation of organic acids or their
              reaction products can lead to synthesis of longer chain hydrocarbons in aqueous
              solutions.  We expect these experiments to resolve the outstanding
              uncertainties in the reactivity of organic acids and allow quantitative
              evaluations to be made of the role of organic acids in geologic processes.
