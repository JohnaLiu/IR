Reconnaissance field work in Esmeralda County,
              Nevada, during 1999 resulted in the discovery of a new Lower Cambrian Burgess
              Shale-type deposit.  The new deposit contains a variety of organisms similar in
              preservational quality to those from the celebrated Burgess Shale (Middle
              Cambrian of British Columbia) and the Chengjiang Lagerstatte (Lower Cambrian of
              Yunnan, China).  The new site is of importance because it is the oldest Burgess
              Shale-type deposit known from North America, and one of the oldest such
              deposits globally.  Exploratory investigation of the western Nevada site is
              proposed in order to secure available fossils for science before the public
              becomes aware of its existence.  The primary purposes of this work are: 1, to
              investigate the paleontological potential of the new locality; 2, to conduct
              preliminary studies on the paleoenvironmental circumstances (both depositional
              and taphonomic) under which the biota was fossilized; and 3, to accurately
              assess the age of the new site.  The new deposit is expected to add important
              new information to our understanding of the "Cambian explosion," and
              particularly the early fossil record of the event as recorded in the North
              America-Greenland paleocontinent.
