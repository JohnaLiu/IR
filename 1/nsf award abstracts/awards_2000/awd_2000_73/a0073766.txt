The research will investigate the processes that lead to
              the generation of magmas in the earth's upper mantle. The methods of
              experimental petrology will be used and melting experiments will be performed
              at elevated temperature (1200 - 1700 oC) and pressure (2 - 5 GPa) under
              anhydrous and H2O-undersaturated conditions.  Samples used for the experiments
              will be metasomatized mantle analog compositions and natural basalt
              compositions.  Two types of experiments will be performed.  The first set of
              experiments will produce melts saturated with mantle minerals (olivine,
              orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and garnet) and the variation in composition of
              the melt will be used to develop predictive analytic models for the conditions
              of melt generation in the subcontinental mantle.  The second set of experiments
              will use selected naturally occurring basaltic magmas from a range of
              continental tectonic settings (the Tibetan Plateau, Sierra Nevada and Mexican
              back arc) and will determine the conditions of melt generation in these
              settings.  From these results models will be developed that evaluate the
              controls of pressure, temperature, H2O and variations in mantle bulk
              composition on mantle melting reactions.  The experiments and models will
              provide constraints on the processes of stabilization of sub-continental
              lithosphere, mantle flow and melting beneath continents and the influence of
              the flux of volatiles through the mantle.
