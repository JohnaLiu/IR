Abstract    :
              This research will determine the mechanisms and processes underlying the
              evolution, maintenance, and enhancement of reproductive isolation.  Mimulus
              guttatus and M. nasutus (Scrophulariaceae) two naturally hybridizing species of
              wildflowers, are used as a model system for studying reproductive isolation. 
              Studies of this nature are important in determining the causes and consequences
              for gene flow between closely related taxa, and are therefore ultimately
              important in understanding early processes of speciation.  To date, major
              reproductive isolating mechanisms have been identified in these two species:
              differences in flowering phenology, a predominantly selfing mating system of M.
              nasutus, and preliminary evidence of hybrid breakdown in the form of pollen
              inviability.  This study will determine the fitness of hybrids relative to both
              parent species in a common garden setting.  One experiment will place hybrid
              and parental organisms in a naturally occurring hybrid zone, and measure
              fitness, phenological overlap, and selfing rates for hybrid individuals
              relative to the parentals.  This experiment will allow examination of the
              nature of reproductive isolation, and prediction of the consequences to gene
              flow this breakdown causes.
