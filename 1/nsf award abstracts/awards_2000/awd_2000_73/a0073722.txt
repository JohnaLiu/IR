Experiments and molecular simulations will be
              performed in parallel to examine the behavior of mineral surface charge, zeta
              potential and adsorption in aqueous solutions at elevated temperatures.
              Numerous research groups are currently working on these phenomena; however,
              almost no data exists for these parameters at elevated temperatures up to 300
              degrees C. The method to be employed is microelectrophoresis for determination
              of electrical mobilities of oxide particles. The minerals chosen for this study
              are corundum and zircon. Water flow through the crust near radioactive waste
              storage facilities and in hydrothermal areas occurs in the temperature range of
              this study. Knowledge of the surface charge and zeta potential with temperature
              are critical for predicting adsorption behavior of ions because a change in
              sign can signal a shift from adsorption to desorption. Understanding adsorption
              behavior is in turn key to the ability to predict the migration of contaminants
              in the subsurface. Due to difficulties in assessing the positions of ions near
              a mineral surface in situ under high temperature conditions, molecular
              simulations are a valuable companion to the experimental component of this
              research. Both quantum and classic mechanical simulations of surfaces, water
              and counterions are planned. By linking experiment and theory via the measured
              and simulated points-of-zero charge and zeta potentials, the structure of
              counter-ions near a surface may be reliably modeled. Molecular simulations
              provide insight into the amount of adsorption likely to take place and the
              mechanisms of adsorption that control the kinetics of ions near surfaces.
