Abstract    :
              This research focuses on how the complex chorus environment influences
              communication in two closely related species of gray treefrogs. Specific
              objectives are to determine if there are differences between the species in the
              frequency with which receivers (females) commit errors under less than ideal
              communication conditions, and to investigate whether male signaling strategies
              differ between the species in ways predictable by receiver behavior. These
              objectives will be addressed by (1) monitoring calling behavior of males and
              mate choice by females in natural and artificial choruses, (2) exposing females
              to multiple synthetic call sources presented to mimic chorus complexity, and
              (3) investigating male signaling interactions with artificial signals varied to
              represent differing social conditions.  

How the signals of animals are
              designed to transfer information to receivers has been of interest to
              investigators of behavior for some time, but environmental influences on
              uncertainty in communication have often been ignored. To understand how a
              communication system may have been evolved, it is necessary to determine how
              signalers and receivers interact under realistic conditions. Because of their
              readily observable and stereotyped communication behavior, frogs are ideal for
              investigating interactions between signalers, receivers and the environment.
