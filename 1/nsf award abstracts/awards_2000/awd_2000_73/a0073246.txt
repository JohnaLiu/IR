Plant species that are rare where they are native often
              become abundant and widespread where they are introduced.  Field experiments
              and greenhouse studies have been initiated to determine whether the observed
              differences in the abundance and habitat distribution of the invasive shrub
              Clidemia hirta (Melastomataceae) in its native area (Costa Rica) and area of
              introduction (Hawaii) result from environmental or genetic differences.  This
              research will be enhanced by conducting a broad-scale survey of the genetic
              structure of native and introduced populations of C. hirta to determine whether
              those in Hawaii are similar or depauperate in genetic variation to those in the
              native range.  This study will determine whether shifts in the breeding system
              or genetic structure have occurred that would affect the invasiveness of C.
              hirta.  The historical process of the invasion (numbers of introductions,
              presence of founder effects, adaptation after introduction) and the resulting
              distribution of different genotypes among the Hawaiian Islands will also be
              examined.

This study is the first comparison of genetic variation and
              breeding system of a woody plant between its native and introduced areas. 
              Information about the genetic diversity of this species in Hawaii will be
              valuable for devising effective biological control programs that match locally
              adapted genotype-natural enemy pairs.
