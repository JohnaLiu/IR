Magnetotellurics and geomagnetic depth sounding have revealed zones of
              anomalously high electrical conductivity in a variety of crustal and mantle
              environments. Crustal and shallow mantle high conductivity zones are observed
              beneath continental collision zones, mid ocean ridges and the ocean floor, and
              continental shields, among other areas, and mantle transition zone
              high-conductivity zones are generally observed at depths of 300-400 km. A
              variety of explanations for these high conductivity features have been invoked
              including the presence of partial melt, hydrogen in minerals, aqueous fluids,
              and the presence of interconnected or oriented metals or other highly
              conducting minerals (with different explanations for different areas). In order
              to properly invert and interpret magnetotelluric response functions, the
              electrical response of Earth materials in the low frequency range must be
              determined. This proposal outlines an experimental effort to determine the
              electrical conductivity and the complex electrical impedance of relevant
              geological materials at elevated temperatures and pressures over the frequency
              range 0.0001 to 100,000 Hz. In particular, 1) the influence of melt composition
              and texture at low melt fraction on the bulk electrical properties of partially
              molten systems and 2) the influence of hydrogen in hydrous minerals (amphibole,
              serpentine) and nominally anhydrous minerals (olivine and pyroxene) on
              electrical properties will be examined. The electrical properties of texturally
              equilibrated partially molten olivine-basalt systems will be studied at one bar
              total pressure and at elevated temperatures and pressures (up to 2000 degrees C
              and 20 GPa) in a multiple anvil device. The electrical properties of hydrous
              minerals and hydrogen-containing nominally anhydrous minerals will be examined
              at temperatures up to 1200 degrees C and .8 - 1 GPa in an internally heated
              device under appropriate water fugacity conditions. The results will be
              interpreted in terms of equivalent electrical circuits that can be related to
              models of ionic processes. The results of this study will be important for the
              interpretation and modeling of magnetotelluric data and will also shed new
              light on physical transport processes in a variety of geological environments.
              The ultimate benefits will be more detailed understanding of the temperature
              profile and physical state of matter at depth in the Earth's interior.
