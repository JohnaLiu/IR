Abstract    :
              Value locality, a recently discovered program attribute that describes the
              likelihood of the recurrence of previously seen program values, has been
              studied enthusiastically in the published literature. This project investigates
              a new domain for the exploitation of value locality, namely shared-memory
              multiprocessor (SMP) systems running commercial workloads. Initial results from
              a recent study of store value locality indicate that significant potential
              exists for reducing multiprocessor data and address bus traffic by identifying
              and squashing silent and stochastically silent stores. This project describes
              and evaluates exact mechanisms for store squashing techniques, investigates
              alternative approaches for exploiting value locality, and finally, develops
              focused mechanisms for attacking the specific problem of read/write data
              sharing and synchronization in SMP systems. The project demonstrates that
              overcoming the performance bottlenecks caused by data sharing requires
              speculative techniques based on value locality, since other more conventional
              approaches to speculative execution are guaranteed to fail.  This research
              realizes the potential of speculative techniques that exploit value locality to
              improve performance and/or reduce implementation cost and complexity in future
              generation shared-memory multiprocessor systems that are designed to run
              commercial workloads.
