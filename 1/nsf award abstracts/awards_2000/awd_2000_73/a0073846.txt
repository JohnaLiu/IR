In Southwest England two mussel species, Mytilus
              edulis and M. galloprovincialis, interbreed and produce fertile hybrid
              offspring.  Within this region individuals that are more closely related to M.
              galloprovincialis have better survival as adults than individuals that are more
              closely related to M. edulis.  While you would predict that this advantage
              would result in M. galloprovincialis out-competing M. edulis and taking over
              the region, this hybrid zone has remained in the same location with the same
              proportions of the two species for at least 20 years.  This study will
              determine what evolutionary factors are stabilizing the hybrid zone and
              offsetting the directional selection favoring M. galloprovincialis. Two
              potential factors are gene flow and natural selection favoring Mytilus edulis
              in the larval stage.  It is possible that larvae that settle in the hybrid zone
              are predominantly coming from pure M. edulis populations and that this influx
              could offset natural selection. Larvae that settle in this region will be
              collected and their probable population of origin will be determined using
              genetic markers.  This information will determine how far mussel larvae
              generally travel and in what direction.  It is also possible that natural
              selection favoring M. edulis is occurring in the larval stage.  This can be
              determined by raising larval mussels in the laboratory and determining changes
              in the genetic composition of the larvae.
