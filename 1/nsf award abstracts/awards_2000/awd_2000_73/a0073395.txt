Abstract    :
              The goal of this work is to improve the ability to simulate airflow over complex
              terrain using large-eddy simulation (LES).  The approach is to apply to
              meteorology some of the recent advances that have been made in the modeling of
              engineering flows.  Specifically, the objectives are (1) to develop and test
              several approximations for surface boundary conditions and models for
              characterizing the scales of motion that are unresolved by LES; and (2) to
              investigate the physics of atmospheric flows by applying the new models to data
              from several field studies.  The approach employs highly parallel computing to
              achieve a grid resolution of about 10 m in the horizontal and 100 levels in the
              vertical.  Examples of the kinds of complex situations to be investigated
              include inversion layers within a deep valley, steep orography, and valley
              winds.
