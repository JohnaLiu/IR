The Bird's Head region at the northern edge
              of the Australian continent contains the world's fastest slipping continental
              strike-slip system. Preliminary evidence indicates that block rotation
              accompanies the shear. The investigators propose to improve our understanding
              of the mechanics of distributed shear in continents and of block rotations by
              densifying GPS measurements across the Irian Jaya shear zone. They will install
              about 40 new GPS sites and measure them twice over a 2.5 year interval. These
              data will allow the investigators to test whether or not the distribution of
              deformation within the Irian Jaya shear zone is consistent with 'floating
              block' models in which crustal blocks are moved by tractions on their bases
              imparted by a flowing mantle.
