Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a research program in experimental high
              energy physics based at Rutgers University.  The major focus of the group for
              the next three years is on:
 
Preparation and operation of theCDF detector at
              the Fermilab Tevatron to study proton-antiproton interactions at 2
              TeV,

Preparation of the CMS experiment for future operation at the Large
              Hadron Collider (LHC) currently being built at the CERN laboratory in Geneva
              Switzerland to study proton-proton interactions at 14 TeV,

Observation of
              the highest energy cosmic rays, of order 1020 eV, with the Fly's Eye detector
              in Utah, and the upgrade of that detector (HiRes), and

R&D work on
              chemical-vapor-deposition diamonds for use as particle detectors in intense
              radiation envorinments where corresponding silicon-based detectors cannot
              survive.  This work is supported separately, but is included in the proposal
              for completeness.

In addition, the group is completing analysis work and
              expects to publish results on two earlier experiments: KTeV at Fermilab and SLD
              at SLAC.
