Abstract    :
              Professor John Fourkas of Boston College is funded by the Experimental Physical
              Chemistry program to conduct experimental and theoretical studies on the
              dynamics and structure of bulk and confined liquids.  While decades of
              ultrafast laser studies have revealed much about bulk liquid structure and
              solvation phenomena, the more complex problem of liquids in nanoporous
              structures is a new horizon in this field.  Pools of liquids consisting of 100
              molecules or less are typical.  This proposal seeks to make measurements on
              liquids in sol-gel glasses, with the specific goals of determining how
              molecular shape influences liquid dynamics, how extreme confinement affects the
              behavior of liquids and how confinement affects phase-transition temperatures. 
              The PI then proposes to conduct theoretical studies on liquids, adding the
              effects of anharmonicity of the intermolecular potential of a liquid into the
              computation of correlation functions using instantaneous normal mode theory.  A
              successful outcome of this proposal would be new models of confined liquids
              that could predict phenomena relevant to geochemistry and biochemistry. 
              

Solvation has extremely important industrial applications, and a more
              complete theoretical understanding of this phenomenon could have an important
              impact. Practical examples of liquids in confined spaces include hydrocarbons
              in porous rocks, and water structured by biological molecules. There are also
              environmental implications of this work, in addressing the issue of flow of
              water and dissolved species in porous rock.
