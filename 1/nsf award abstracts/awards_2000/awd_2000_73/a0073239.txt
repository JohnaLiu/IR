Abstract    :
              In many animals, parents produce more and better offspring as they get older.
              Two different explanations have been suggested for this improvement. The first
              is that as parents near the end of their lives, offspring become increasingly
              valuable. Older parents therefore expend more effort on those offspring. The
              second explanation is that older animals have accumulated experience and skills
              with age that allow them to be more efficient with their time and energy. Thus
              older individuals would be able to produce more offspring than younger
              individuals for the same effort. This research will explore these two
              mechanisms in a population of house sparrows, common birds found in backyards
              and on farms. Older and younger parent birds will be observed to compare how
              often they return to the nest to feed young and how long they search for food
              for their chicks. Parental ability will be tested by changing the number of
              young the parent birds have to feed, and by measuring learning ability at
              various ages.

This research contributes to our understanding of changes in
              reproduction with age and examines potential behavioral causes of these
              changes. This will improve our understanding of the ecology of parental
              behavior and how life patterns of behavior affect reproduction.
