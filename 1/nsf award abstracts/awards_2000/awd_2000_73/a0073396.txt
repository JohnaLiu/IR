Convolvulaceae, the Morning-glory Family, with some
              1600-1700 species are a large group of flowering plants. The members of this
              family present a rich diversity of morphological characteristics and ecological
              habitats. Although the family is best known in temperate regions by its weedy
              representatives (e.g., binding weed) many tropical species are valuable
              ornamentals and sources of hallucinogenic drugs and purgatives. The "sweet
              potato" is the World's second most important root crop (> 128 M metric tones
              per year). Furthermore, many species are used as experimental model organisms
              in evolutionary and molecular genetics studies (e.g., comparative study of
              pollination syndromes, research on resistance and tolerance to herbivory and
              pathogens, biochemical pathways research).

Despite this interest, little is
              certain about the historical relationships among members of the Convolvulaceae.
              Large plant groups present challenges to systematists interested in
              understanding the evolution of these groups. Molecular data from chloroplast
              and nuclear DNA sequences, supplemented with floral and vegetative
              morphological data, will be used to obtain accurate reconstruction of the
              relationships within this family. Once resolved, the inferred relationships
              will be used for following purposes: 1) to assist investigators who seek a
              historical context for the appearance of particular significant traits among
              these plants; 2) to analyze the agreement between DNA data and morphological
              data, with the aim of obtaining a natural classification for this family based
              on both kinds of information; and 3) to test a series of hypotheses on
              molecular processes of chloroplast genome evolution in this family, one of the
              few flowering plant families exhibiting substantial chloroplast genome
              rearrangements. This investigation will complement other studies being
              performed in closely related families and will impact the fields of molecular
              evolution, population genetics, taxonomy, and systematics.
