The Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Penn
              State University develops an integrated computational approach in core subjects
              of the graduate and upper-undergraduate curricula.  The approach is based on
              new courses on computational thermodynamics, computational kinetics and
              integrated systems materials design, that integrate fundamental principles and
              advanced computational tools. 

Computer-based educational tools will help
              students connect abstract thermodynamic concepts with the properties of real
              world materials and mathematical kinetics with practical materials processing
              procedures, and thus remove the common perception among students that
              thermodynamics and kinetics are problematical to learn and difficult to apply
              in practice.
