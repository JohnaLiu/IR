Abstract    :
              Many stochastic programming problems can be formulated as
problems of
              optimization of an expected value function. Quite
often the corresponding 
              expected value function cannot be computed
exactly and should be approximated,
              say by Monte Carlo methods.
In fact, in many interesting examples, Monte Carlo
              simulation is
the only  reasonable  way of estimating the expected
value
              function.  It turns out that if the underline probability
distribution is
              discrete and the approximating problems are
piecewise linear and convex, then
              with probability
approaching one exponentially fast, with increase of the
              sample
size, an optimal solution of the Monte Carlo approximation
              problem
provides an  exact  optimal solution of the  expected
value  problem.
               This gives a theoretical justification   for
the  following approach to a
              numerical solution of such problems.
Construct and solve a Monte Carlo
              approximation problem based on a
relatively small sample. Repeat this
              procedure several times and validate
calculated
 solutions  until a stopping
              criterion is satisfied.     The goal of this
project is to develop this
              method. The method is ideally suited for
parallel computations and some
              preliminary experiments  showed good
results.



Optimization of real
              world systems almost always involves randomness which
can come in
various
              conceptual forms such as uncertainty, lack of information, natural
variability
              of the data, etc.  One may think, for example, about optimizing
a
              manufacturing process when the demand for produced goods is uncertain.
              It
turns out that solving stochastic  optimization problems
              involving
randomness is much more difficult than solving deterministic
              problems, both
conceptually and numerically. However,  there is obvious
              practical need for
developing a methodology for dealing with stochastic
              problems and in recent
years this was a very active area of scientific
              research.  This proposal is
aimed at developing numerical techniques for
              solving a particular class of
stochastic problems.  If successful, it will
              allow numerical solutions of
considerably larger problems, which in turn may
              result in bigger variety of
applications.
