This award provides support for Symposia at the AAAS 2000 meeting
              on 17-22 February 2000 in Washington D.C. The meeting, entitled "Science in an
              Uncertain Millennium", is expected to draw over 5000 scientists, engineers,
              educators, and policymakers. 

The symposia are to be conducted as two
              separate parts of the meeting program: 1. Session 151: Health Care, Economics,
              and Technology: An evolving balance, and 2. Session 171: Children and Chronic
              Diseases: Incentives for solutions to lifelong problems. The two sessions are
              to describe results from the investigators' experience with the NSF/Whitaker
              Foundation activity in a Cost Reducing Health Care Technology (CRCHT) research
              project Personal Sensors for the Diagnosis and Management of Metabolic
              Disorders. Issues to be addressed in session 151 are the impacts that economics
              and policy have on the particular cost reducing technology under development.
              The second symposium, session 171, will give specific examples of issues
              pertaining to the development of technology for children's health, which is
              related to the particular CRHCT project.  The symposia are designed to raise
              awareness of these issues in both the scientific and policy communities and
              provide a forum for communicating these issues to a broad audience.  
              

Proceedings of the AAAS Symposia are to be published jointly with those of
              the Symposium Balancing Costs with Benefits of Health Care Technologies in the
              New Millennium: A Global Perspective (BES-0074074) to be held at the World
              Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, July 23-28, 2000,
              Chicago, IL.
