Classical orogenic belts have relatively narrow bands of varied
              rock types that can be related to various environments, such as foreland etc.,
              however several major orogens significantly diverge from this pattern.  The
              Lachlan Orogen of southeastern Australia, correlatives in Antarctica, parts of
              the Pan African in northeast Africa and others have an extremely wide expanse
              of monotonously similar oceanic assemblages, and effectively no foreland.  The
              cause of this extreme width and how deformation patterns and ages relate to the
              tectonic settings of these orogens is controversial.  This project will attempt
              to discriminate between several hypotheses and will involve considerable age
              dating of the deformation.  The oceanic style of orogeny represented by the
              Lachlan orogen appears to be an unrecognized continental growth mechanism that
              has been important throughout earth history, therefore results of this study
              are expected to be applicable in a number of other orogens.
