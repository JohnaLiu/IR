Understanding ecosystem responses to global climate change
              requires knowledge of both climatic constraints on the distribution of
              vegetation physiognomies and the demographic processes that drive plant
              migration. Using semiarid pinon-juniper woodlands as a study system, this
              dissertation research will examine the constraints and drivers of woodland
              dynamics in the context of long-term climatic variation. The research focuses
              specifically on climatic water balance as a constraint on woodland tree
              distribution, and seed production and bird-mediated dispersal as processes
              driving tree migration. The investigators will use remotely sensed tree cover
              estimates with a spatially explicit water balance model to test the hypothesis
              that climatic water balance constrains tree distributions. Using tree-ring
              data, the research will test whether seed production in a dominant woodland
              tree, Pinus edulis, is triggered by climatic fluctuations associated with the
              El Nino/Southern Oscillation. Finally, the links between pinon seedling
              establishment and caching behavior of its primary disperser, the Pinon Jay,
              will be investigated. Together, these studies will inform the development of a
              model of woodland dynamics. This research will increase our understanding of
              the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of ecosystems and potential responses to
              climate change
