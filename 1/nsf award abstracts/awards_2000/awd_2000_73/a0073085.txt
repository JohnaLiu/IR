Title: Efficient Multicast Communication in Switch-Based
              Networks for Quality of Service
PI: Yuanyuan Yang

Multicast involves
              transmitting information from a source to multiple destinations, and is a
              requirement in high-performance networks. It is projected that multicast will
              be increasingly used to support various interactive applications such as
              video-on-demand, teleconferencing, web servers and E-commerce on the Internet.
              Many of these applications require not only multicast capability but also
              predictable performance, such as guaranteed multicast latency and bandwidth,
              called quality-of-service (QoS). The objective of this research is to design a
              QoS capable multicast architecture based on multicast networks with built-in
              QoS functions to support multicast communication. Specially, the research
              focuses on:
(1) design of basic building-block multicast networks with better
              QoS functions and lower network cost;
(2) establishing analytical models on
              performance metrics of statistical QoS-capable multicast architectures;
(3)
              study of efficient schemes to schedule multicast for different QoS
              requirements;
(4) building simulation tools for validating theoretical
              results, and making them available to research community and system
              designers.

This research combines algorithmic, probabilistic, combinatorial,
              and simulation techniques to conduct comprehensive studies. The proposed
              research has a significant impact on scalable and high-performance
              parallel/distributed computing as efficient support for multicast communication
              can significantly reduce the communication latency and simplify the design and
              implementation of numerous parallel/distributed applications.
