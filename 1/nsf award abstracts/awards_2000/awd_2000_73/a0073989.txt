Understanding the mineralogy of Earth's upper mantle
              requires that the elastic properties of all candidate minerals are known. There
              are, however, virtual gaps in the elasticity database at elevated pressure and
              temperature for orthopyroxene and especially clinopyroxene. The primary
              objective of this work is to measure the temperature dependencies of the
              elastic moduli of single-crystal clinopyroxene using resonant ultrasound
              spectroscopy (RUS). This objective requires completing the following
              intermediate goals: 1) developing the RUS theory and computer code appropriate
              for monoclinic crystal symmetry; 2) making mode identification when comparing
              calculated and measured spectra at room temperature; 3) obtaining resonance
              spectra at high temperature for three clinopyroxenes of varying Mg, Fe, Ca
              compositions; and 4) reducing the clinopyroxene resonance data at elevated
              temperature to appropriate Cij vs. T. The secondary objective of this work is
              to measure the high temperature elasticity of two orthopyroxene minerals using
              the orthorhombic RUS scheme that was developed earlier and applied to olivine
              elasticity measurements. Successful completion of these objective will provide
              needed data on pyroxenes at high temperature, new constraints for the
              mineralogy of Earth's upper mantle, and new applications of RUS for measuring
              elasticity of low symmetry monoclinic crystals.
