Abstract    :
              Object-oriented programs contain many "class invariants": propositions that are
              true of all objects of a given class, and remain true even as the objects
              change.  These class invariants are the focus of this research.  There are two
              broad areas of applications for class invariants.  First, class invariants can
              enable compiler
optimizations, allowing programs to run faster.  Second,
              information about class invariants can be of direct use to programmers,
              reducing the number of software defects.  Research goals include building a
              categorization of class invariants that are tractable for static analysis,
              developing static analysis algorithms for class invariants, implementing
              systems that apply class invariants in compiler-style optimization and in
              verification of user-supplied invariants, and empirically evaluating the
              techniques as implemented, with particular attention to their speed and the
              usefulness of the results for standard compiler optimizations.
