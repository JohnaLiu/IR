Title: Research Into Code compression
PI: Trevor Mudge, University
              of Michigan

The research examines the problem of reducing the size of
              programs. This is termed "code compression." The size of programs can adversely
              affect the performance of a computer in several ways, but until recently,
              code
compression has been targeted at low cost systems, where chip size and
              thus cost is at a premium. Reducing chip size suggests that the code
              compression techniques may also reduce power consumption, because the power
              consumed by a chip is related, among other things to its area. Furthermore,
              earlier studies by the Principal Investigator have shown that compression can
              improve the memory system efficiency and, as a result improve system
              performance. There are three directions being pursued in this research: 1) to
              explore the use of code compression to reduce chip size and cost; 2) to explore
              the use of code compression to reduce power; and 3) to explore the use of code
              compression to improve performance. The impact of this work is expected to be
              reduced chip size and power consumption for the same or better performance. The
              research leverages tools that were created by the Principal Investigator in
              prior code compression work.
