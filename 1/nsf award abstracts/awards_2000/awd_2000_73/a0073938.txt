Abstract    :
              This Topical Conference will be focused on optical properties of conjugated
              polymers and photonic crystals.  The organizers expect some 200 attendees about
              half of whom will be students and would like to use the funds to reimburse
              junior research scientists for travel and registration expenses.  Among the
              areas to be covered are forefront research topics such as photonic band-gap
              materials, photonic applications of organic materials optics of photonic
              crystals, and others.
