The landscape of New England has been drastically
              altered over the last 300 years, most obviously by the shrinking and recent
              reemergence of the forest cover. While forest cover has increased from a low of
              less than 30% in a highly fragmented distribution during the mid 1800s to the
              current 65%, nothing is known of the affect of this bottleneck on the genetic
              diversity and structure of the species of these communities.  Records of
              Massachusetts forest cover in the 1830s provide an opportunity to examine these
              effects.  These records are used to determine historic deforestation patterns
              in four areas of Massachusetts.  DNA markers will be used to characterize the
              genetic diversity and population structure of Red Oak (Quercus rubra), a
              dominant tree of both old-growth and secondary forests.  Thi study will
              describe the genetic structure of old-growth populations, determine whether
              secondary-growth populations have lower genetic diversity, and characterize the
              patterns of recruitment, dispersal and structure associated with historical
              deforestation records.
 
Results will be useful in planning the conservation
              of New England forests and regional development and will provide the first data
              showing the long-term consequences of deforestation and forest degradation. The
              historical perspective of New England could be used as baseline data
              characterizing these long-term affects.  These data will identify critical
              refugia of genetic diversity and characterize dispersal patterns and population
              structure, all important parameters for conservation management.
