The major focus of this proposal is to
              determine the kinematics of the earthquake rupture process on a finite fault by
              investing seismic waveforms that include 3D earth structure.  The rupture
              process on the fault is deduced by iteratively fitting the synthetic ground
              motions to the data.  The Green's functions play a critical role in the
              calculation.  Finite difference methods can be used to calculate the Green's
              functions for a complex, 3D earth structure.  Including these 3D Green's
              functions in inversions for the kinematic source parameters on a finite fault
              is a natural extension of current methods for determining the parameters of
              earthquake rupture.  To further improve the inversions special functions (cubic
              B-spline) can be used to discretize the spatial distribution of the kinematic
              parameters on a finite fault.  The 3D Green's functions and the cubic B-spline
              functions will be combined with a newly developed nonlinear inversion method
              that is necessary for a global search of the kinematic parameters needed to
              describe the rupture.  Data from the California earthquakes, 1979 M 5.9 Coyote
              Lake, 1989 M 7.1 Loma Prieta, 1994 M 6.7 Northridge, and the 1999 M 7.7 Chi
              Chi, Taiwan earthquake will be analyzed.
