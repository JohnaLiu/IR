Abstract    :
              The main objective of this project is to develop new routes to important
              materials by designing rapid solid-state methasis (exchanged) reactions that
              use appropriate additives such as ammonium chloride to control temperature and
              pressure.  Systems to be synthesized include indium nitride and its solid
              solutions with gallium nitride and aluminum nitride, which are expected to
              luminesce across the entire visible range form red to violet and beyond.  Also,
              cubic molybdenum nitride, a hydrodesulfurizaiton catalyst, will be synthesized,
              and new routes of carbon nanotubes will be explored and optimized through the
              control of reaction temperature where a computer program will be developed to
              determine maximum reaction temperatures based on thermodynamic data.

This
              project is aimed at the control of pressure and temperature in metathesis
              reactions for the synthesis of a number of industrially relevant materials such
              as carbon nanotubes, encapsulated metals, silicon nitride, cubic boron nitride
              and molybdenum nitride that are difficult to prepare.  These materials all have
              interesting optical, mechanical or catalytic properties.  The students involved
              in this research will learn synthetic and characterization techniques, and they
              will have an opportunity to collaborate with national laboratory and industrial
              scientists.  This unique integration of research and education will help to
              make these students highly competitive in the job market
