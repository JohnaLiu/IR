Abstract    :
              This proposal explores how plants respond to injury by leaf-feeding insects by
              increasing defenses in new tissue.  The black mustard, Brassica nigra, has two
              principal leaf-damaging insects in nature: the mustard flea beetle and
              caterpillar of the cabbage white butterfly.  A preliminary study showed that
              feeding by the caterpillar caused the black mustard to double the density of
              protective hairs on new leaves, whereas feeding by flea beetles did not.  The
              new experiments test whether this doubling of leaf hair density protects new
              leaves from subsequent damage by either herbivore and will show whether greater
              initial damage stimulates even greater protection of new leaves by the plant. 
              The experiments will also test whether a plant's ability to protect itself
              declines with age.
	There are three significant aspects to this research. 
              First, researchers have primarily concentrated on responses of plant chemistry
              to insect damage and often ignored leaf hairs.  Second, little is known about
              whether there is competition among leaf-damaging insects in nature.  This
              research may demonstrate that competition between insects occurs indirectly
              through their effects on plant resistance.  Third, the research may indicate
              how crop scientists can manipulate intrinsic defenses of agricultural crops to
              more effectively combat insect pests.
