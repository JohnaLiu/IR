While physical and chemical defenses provide plants with
              immunity from nearly all of the potential natural enemies in their environment,
              most plants are still attacked by a community of herbivores that are able to
              overcome these defenses.   A major question in evolutionary ecology is what
              prevents plants from evolving improved resistance to herbivory.  The thesis of
              this research is that there are potential constraints on the evolution of
              resistance that are revealed only by examining the entire community of
              herbivores that feed on a host plant.  Through a series of field experiments
              using the insect herbivore community of horsenettle (Solanum carolinense), this
              research will investigate these constraints by assessing genetic variation for
              resistance, characterizing natural selection acting on resistance, and
              investigating the ecological interactions among the insects and their host
              plant.

This research addresses basic scientific questions regarding
              plant-herbivore coevolution and the nature of potential competition among
              plant-eating insects.  In addition, horsenettle is an economically important
              weed, and its close kinship with a number of crop species enables it to act as
              a reservoir for a number of crop pests.  Therefore, this research will also
              provide information that is of interest to weed control and pest management
              programs.
