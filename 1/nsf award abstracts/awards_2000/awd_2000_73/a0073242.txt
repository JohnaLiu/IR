Gene movement is a critical process for the long-term survival
              of natural populations.  For temperate tree species, pollen movement is the
              most important vector of gene movement within and between populations.  The
              physical structure of the forest determines the distance of pollen movement and
              the distribution of conspecific trees affects the amount of inbred matings. 
              The major goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that modification of
              forest structure, through the application of alternate forest management
              techniques (even-aged, uneven-aged, and no management treatments), influences
              pollen movement in a common forest tree species, short leaf pine (Pinus
              echinata).  Using allozymes as genetic markers, two specific objectives are
              addressed.  First, the investigators will compare patterns of pollen movement
              across each treatment using a recently developed statistical model that allows
              hypothesis testing on a landscape scale.  Second, they will compare mating
              patterns within populations (proportion of self- and inbred matings and number
              of pollen donors) across the three treatments.   

Increasingly, forests are
              becoming managed for resource extraction and ecosystem conservation. 
              Understanding how forest modification influences the patterns of gene movement
              will provide needed insight about environmental impact on population-level
              changes in gene frequencies.  Such insight facilitates the development of
              effective strategies for species conservation.
