Abstract    :
              EAR-0073433
Prewitt
The density of the Earth's core is about 10% less than
              that of pure nickel-iron at core pressures and temperatures.  Several elements
              have been proposed to account for the low density of the core, including
              sulfur, silicon, carbon, potassium, hydrogen, and oxygen.  Because potassium
              and phosphorous are depleted in the Earth's mantle, it has been proposed that
              this depletion may result from incorporation of these elements in Earth's core.
               However, phases with compositions including these elements are known only from
              syntheses at relatively low pressures and from meteorites, and there has been
              little or no experimental work at higher pressures and temperatures, especially
              those approaching core conditions.  Therefore, we will investigate the
              high-pressure, high-temperature chemistry and structures of two different
              classes of phases that could be present under core conditions, potassium-iron
              sulfides and iron-nickel phosphides.  From these experiments, we expect to
              provide information on the synthesis of these materials, their phase relations,
              and their structural characteristics.  We also will investigate the
              partitioning of K and P between bulk silicate earth and metallic liquids in the
              presence or absence of S and/or C.  Experimental techniques will include
              synthesis of appropriate materials under controlled vapor pressures,
              temperature, and overall pressure, characterization of products with electron
              and ion microprobes, and in-situ structural measurements at high-pressures and
              temperatures using x-ray diffraction in our laboratory and at national
              synchrotron sources, and by a variety of spectroscopic techniques.
