This project supports a symposium to be held on  23 - 27 June, 2000, in
              Bloomington, Indiana, titled "Biodiversity: the Interface between Systematics
              and Conservation."  The workshop-symposium will  be held in conjunction with
              the joint meetings of the Society of Systematic Biologists, Society for the
              Study of Evolution, the American Soceity of Naturalists, and the Association
              for Tropical Biology.  The symposium is designed to bring together for the
              first time researchers from a wide variety of fields related biodiversity and
              conservation to discuss the relevance of systematics to their research and to
              evaluate various techniquest that make use of systematic and taxonomic data. 
              The topic is timely because of the increasing recognition of the importance of
              systematic data in conservation biology, and the wealth of new methods
              available.  The participants will explore various aspects of biodiversity
              studies in light of how systematics and conservation can work together to
              explore biodiversity issues.  The symposium will also highlight recent
              developments in computer software that utilize systematic data for assesment of
              geographically based conservation activities.
