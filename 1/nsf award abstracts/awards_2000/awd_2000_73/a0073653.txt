Workshop: Developing a research agenda for
              linking biogeophysical and socioeconomic systems

Humans have become a global
              biogeochemical force, with a large and growing influence on the dynamics and
              functioning of the Earth's biosphere. At the same time, there is an increasing
              recognition of the extent to which environmental goods and services (e.g.,
              water purification, pollination, pathogen control) have fueled economic growth
              and benefited humans. Many of the most compelling interdisciplinary questions
              on environmental systems lie at the interface of ecological sciences and human
              sciences. This grant will support an extensive cross-disciplinary dialog among
              natural and socioeconomic scientists in order to develop a prioritized research
              agenda for this emerging field of inquiry.
