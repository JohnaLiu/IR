DDIG: Investigations of a dynamic
              microbially-mediated iron cycle in the rhizosphere of wetland
              plants

Wetlands naturally filter pollutants from streams, rivers, lakes and
              groundwater. The investigators have found iron-oxidizing bacteria living on
              plant root surfaces that can use dissolved iron -a pollutant at high
              concentrations- as an energy source, thus removing it from water.  Other forms
              of bacteria consume the rust coating on roots and release it back into the
              water.  This creates a cycle of iron being trapped and released in the wetland
              system.  The investigators will study the types of bacteria present and their
              role in the wetland iron cycle to determine if wetlands remove and store iron
              in wetland soils over long time periods. The research will also examine the
              effects of the iron cycle in the wetland plant rhizosphere on methanogenesis.
