Abstract    :
              The 9th International Conference on the Cell and Molecular Biology of
              Chlamydomonas will be held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands on May 21-26, 2000.
              The biennial Chlamydomonas meetings bring together a highly interactive and
              collaborative community of ~200 researchers from Europe, Asia, Australia and
              North America. The international nature of this relatively small group of
              scientists has proven invaluable in the development of Chlamydomonas as the
              model organism of choice for many fundamental biological problems including
              cell motility and behavior, flagellar structure, function and assembly, basal
              body architecture and duplication, organelle heredity, gametic differentiation,
              cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, cell fusion, metabolism and
              photosynthesis. Because nearly half of the scientists in this community are
              from Europe, every second meeting is now held on that continent. This means
              that every four years U.S. scientists are faced with the challenge of funding
              travel to a meeting in Europe. This project solicits funds to support invited
              speakers from the U.S., as well as U.S. postdoctoral fellows and students.
