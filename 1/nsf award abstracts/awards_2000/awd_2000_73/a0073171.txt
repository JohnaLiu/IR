The range expansion by forest trees following rapid climatic
              warming during the early Holocene provides a useful analog for predicting the
              ability of trees to respond to future climate change. Currently, however, early
              Holocene migration rates determined from fossil pollen records can not be
              easily reconciled with models of seed dispersal. This dissertation research is
              an attempt to reconcile the historical record and the dispersal biology of
              common eastern deciduous forest trees. First, migration routes and glacial
              refugia based on the distribution of molecular markers (cpDNA haplotypes)
              throughout the modern range of Fagus grandifolia, Acer rubrum, and Quercus
              rubra will be reconstructed. Maps of Holocene range expansion based on
              molecular and pollen data will provide improved estimates of climate driven
              migration rates. This study will then evaluate the ability of seed dispersal
              models to account for these migration rates using a dispersal model developed
              by this research group. The model will be parameterized using the distribution
              of seedlings established in old-fields and closed forests. By integrating
              fossil pollen and molecular data, this study will develop a more complete
              record of historical change. Explaining that change in terms of dispersal
              biology will allow a mechanistic basis for evaluating future change.
