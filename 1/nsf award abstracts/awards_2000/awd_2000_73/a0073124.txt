The function of the biosphere can no longer be understood
              without addressing the human population.  With nearly 50% of the human
              population in urban areas, it is imperative to understand what determines the
              location and size of human settlements (cities and towns). This project will
              document the global pattern of human settlements and explore the possible
              causes of pattern. A combination of satellite imagery and census data will be
              analyzed to quantify the spatial distribution of settlements and the relative
              frequencies of settlements of different sizes. To investigate possible
              ecological causes of these patterns, a computer simulation will then be
              developed that incorporates essential components of modern global human
              behavior (urbanization, reproduction, food and water consumption, and trade)
              and ecological factors (arable land and fresh water availability, climate, and
              accessibility).
	 
Results of this study should identify basic, worldwide
              patterns of human settlement that are indicative of both fundamental human
              behaviors and ecological factors that limit and facilitate urbanization. 
              Determination of the human and ecological controls of urbanization should
              inform public and economic policy.  This research will be crucial for
              understanding and managing urban growth and ecological resources in an era of
              increasing globalization and urbanization.
