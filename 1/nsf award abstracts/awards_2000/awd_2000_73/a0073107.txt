Understanding the impacts of large disturbances on natural
              communities is a major goal for community ecologists and is important for
              successful tropical forest conservation. Hurricanes can have profound effects
              on the structuring of tropical forests. Although there are studies
              investigating the response of plant communities to hurricanes, few studies have
              investigated the response of faunal communities. This proposed research will
              investigate the effects of a hurricane on an ecologically important animal
              group, the ants. Ants are the most abundant animals in many tropical systems
              and they have many effects on ecosystem functioning. Despite their importance,
              little is known about their response to hurricanes.

The proposed research
              will consist of field monitoring and a field experiment in a series of
              sub-tropical forest habitats. The habitats fall on a continuum of agricultural
              disturbance and recovery. The plots range from pastures abandoned in 1993 to
              mature forest with no record of disturbance. Two primary goals are to document
              the community response to the hurricane and agricultural disturbances and to
              investigate a mechanism by which the hurricane may act on the ant community.
              Research results will increase our understanding of faunal community response
              to compounded large disturbances and their potential for long term recovery.
