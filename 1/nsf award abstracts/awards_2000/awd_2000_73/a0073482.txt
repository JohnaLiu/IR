Abstract    :
               This project investigates the compiled communication technique on 
commodity
              networks. In compiled communication, high performance 
communication is
              achieved by using the compiler to analyze the communication 
requirement of a
              program and to manage network resources statically to 
support the
              communications. As a result, runtime communication overheads, 
such as buffer
              management, are reduced and/or amortized over a number of 
communications, and
              the communication performance is improved. Compiled
communication is more
              powerful than traditional communication optimization 
techniques in that it
              performs communication optimizations in both the
compiler and the
              hardware/operating system/runtime system. The outcome
of the proposed research
              is an extension of the MPI library that supports
the compiled communication
              model, a SUIF based restructure compiler that 
can generate communication code
              using the compiled communication model,
an experimental demonstration of how
              much performance improvement can be
achieved by using the compiled
              communication model, and a clear 
identification of the advantages and
              limitations of the compiled communication
model.
