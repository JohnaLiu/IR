This project investigates the consequences of wing loss in
              longhorn beetles over a variety of temporal and spatial scales. DNA variation
              will be examined in longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) in order to compare
              population structure, biogeography, and diversification rates between winged
              and flightless insects.  Gene flow will be measured between populations on a
              variety of spatial scales, and mitochondrial DNA will be examined to resolve
              the genealogical history of these groups. 

This information will then used
              to examine how climate changes during the Pleistocene Epoch, immediately
              following the last ice age, may have differentially affected the distribution
              of winged and flightless insects. Information from nuclear DNA and
              mitochondrial DNA will be used to establish species limits, contrast levels of
              endemism between winged and flightless insects, and identify cryptic and/or
              endangered species or populations.  Finally, these genetic data will be
              compared with information about geologic history to examine the extent to which
              extrinsic geologic events have played a role in promoting diversification in
              these two groups.  This will in turn improve our understanding of how species
              are formed and differentiated from one another. 

In addition to its
              scientific benefits, this project will improve our understanding of past
              climate change, which will allow us to make better predictions about the
              consequences of contemporary climate change due to man-made atmospheric
              gases.
