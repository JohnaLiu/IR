This award supports research on the low frequency (0.1-1000
              Hz) electrical properties of unconsolidated, under-saturated sediments.
              Previous research has identified the value of complex resistivity (CR)
              measurements for predicting grain size distribution, hydraulic conductivity and
              hydrocarbon contaminants in saturated media. However, the influence of
              under-saturation on polarization mechanisms occurring at the grain-fluid
              interface is not well understood. This work will investigate the CR dependence
              on degree of saturation and will hence determine its application in
              hydrogeological and agricultural assessments of the vadose zone. Ground
              penetrating radar and electrical resistivity methods can provide information on
              moisture content. The use of CR for providing additional hydrological
              information, such as capillary potential, pore fluid distribution and
              hysteresis effects in a drying-wetting cycle, will be determined. This work
              initiates research in applied electrical geophysics at the University of
              Missouri, Kansas City. The PI will make measurements of complex resistivity,
              degree of saturation and capillary potential on a range of unconsolidated
              sediments during a cycle of drainage and wetting. Important structural
              parameters, including grain size distribution, specific surface area, porosity,
              true formation factor and mineralogy will be evaluated for all samples. As
              structural properties control the surface area over which polarization acts,
              the CR response to saturation is expected to vary considerably for the range of
              unconsolidated sediments investigated.
