This proposal involves three projects, all directed
              at developing a more complete understanding of how the magmatic processes such
              as magma mixing, crystallization, crystal-melt separation, and degassing occur
              in gas-rich, subduction zone volcanic systems.  The tasks involve a range of
              analytical work (i.e., electron microprobe, ion-probe, F.T.I.R spectroscopy) on
              samples collected during field study, and on samples prepared experimentally
              under controlled P, T, and fO2,  conditions.  The first project is an
              investigation of the 1912 eruption of Mt. Katmai where three compositionally
              distinct magmas were erupted in a single event.  The study is simultaneously an
              investigation of magma mixing processes, and a test of the zoned magma storage
              region hypothesis proposed by Hildreth.  The second task is one in which
              fundamental data will be obtained on the composition of volcanic gases as a
              function of P, T, fO2, and the composition of coexisting crystals and melt. 
              This study will consider CO2-H2O-S composition gas phases.  The third project
              is a study of the volcanic eruptions which occurred almost simultaneously at
              Black Butte and adjacent Mount Shasta in California.  The objective of this
              work is to determine the pre-eruption magma condition for the two eruptions,
              and to develop an expression relating magmatic conditions and the compositions
              of coexisting plagioclase and hornblende which are prominent phases in these
              eruptions.
