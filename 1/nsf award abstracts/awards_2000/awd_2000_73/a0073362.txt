Research in theoretical nuclear physics will study excitations
              of
the nucleon, exotic mesons and baryons containing excited gluons,
bound
              states of gluons known as glueballs, and the interactions in
two hadron
              systems using computer simulations of quarks and gluons.  
These systems
              should provide vital clues about quark confinement
which is of central
              importance in our attempt to understand the
strong nuclear force.  The project
              goals relate in large part to the
scientific mission of the Thomas Jefferson
              National Accelerator
Facility.
