Abstract    :
              This project is about problems related to integral closures of ideals,
              specifically on generalizations of the Briancon-Skoda theorem, on joint
              reductions, on divisor intersection theory, and on F-rationality of Rees
              algebras.  The Pi will spend a year at the University of Kansas colaborating
              with Craig Huneke and Daniel Katz.  A part of the project is to write a book on
              integral closures of ideals together with Huneke and to teach a graduate level
              course based on the book during the second semester.   This POWRE project is
              supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) and the MPS Office of 
              Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).
