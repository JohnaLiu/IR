Abstract    :
              
The PIs form a research group whose work emphasizes the connections between
              model theory (a branch of mathematical logic) and other parts of mathematics.
              They have established a successful, coordinated research program and an
              excellent environment for postdocs, graduate students, and visitors. They plan
              to build on that current level of activity by adding one postdoc and by
              providing research support for three graduate students, as well as by bringing
              in some more established researchers for shorter periods of time and by
              organizing meetings for dissemination of new developments. 

The general aim
              of the PIs and the group working around them is to increase the effectiveness
              of model theory as a tool in mathematics, and to use feedback from these
              interactions to guide the further development of model theory itself. The work
              that would be supported by this grant covers most areas of model theory and its
              applications.
