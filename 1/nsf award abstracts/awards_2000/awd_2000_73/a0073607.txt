One of the remotely sensed properties of the upper mantle is
              its electrical conductivity. Surface geophysical measurements, often
              magnetotelluric soundings, are used to infer this property. Interpretation of
              the resulting electrical conductivity cross sections must rely on laboratory
              measurements, however. The investigators propose a unique integration of
              magnetotelluric measurements, xenolith studies, and laboratory experiments in
              order to determine the present physical state of the upper mantle beneath the
              Sierra Nevada and California Basin and Range. Further, they outline a series of
              deformation experiments that will provide constraints on the amount and type of
              deformation in the mantle that accompanied the late Cenozoic extension of the
              western margin of the Basin and Range province. A particularly important part
              of this project is to examine the separate and possibly synergistic roles
              played by solid silicate components and immiscible sulfide and silicate melts.
              A key component of this study will be to quantify the amount of electrical
              anisotropy induced at various amounts of deformation and melting.
