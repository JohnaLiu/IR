Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              continues support for the work of Dr. Miguel A. Garcia-Garibay in the
              Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, Los
              Angeles.   The research aims at understanding chemical dynamics in highly
              constrained environments - crystalline organic solids at temperatures
              approaching absolute zero.   Reactions are initiated by laser flash photolysis
              and studied by a variety of methods including x-ray diffraction, differential
              scanning calorimetry, solid state 13C NMR, and infrared and Raman spectroscopy.
                Quantum mechanical tunneling will be studied by means of deuterium isotope
              effects, anomalous Arrhenius plots of rate constants, and by theoretical and
              computational chemistry.

The proposed work involves the changes in
              reactivity of highly reactive organic intermediates, generated photochemically,
              when these intermediates are formed not in liquid solution where there is
              considerable freedom of motion, but in highly constrained crystalline solids at
              low temperatures.   Unusual products can form under these circumstances at
              rates that are much higher than would be expected based on rates near room
              temperature.   Studies of this type can give insight into the detailed dynamics
              of the reactions involved.  The work provides excellent training for students
              in organic synthesis, spectroscopy, kinetics, and computational chemistry.  
              The PI actively recruits underrepresented minority students, especially
              Hispanics, to do research in his laboratory.
