This research examines patterns of body size in North American
              freshwater fishes at evolutionary, and regional and local community levels. 
              Ecological and other factors related to observed patterns will be identified. 
              Preliminary results contradict patterns commonly seen in paleontological
              studies by describing an evolutionarily decreasing trend in body size in seven
              of nine families of fishes.  Preliminary analyses of regional communities
              indicate that body size increases with latitude.  Results of this research will
              lead to a much better understanding of the factors responsible for variation in
              body size and are likely to be applicable to other groups of organisms.
