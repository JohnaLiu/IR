Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. Maitland Jones in the Department of Chemistry at
              Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey.   The aim of the work is to
              investigate the chemistry of reactive organic intermediates including carbenes,
              cycloalkynes, and diradicals.   Examples are
              trans-2,3-dimethylcyclopropylcarbene, cyclopentyne, and 1,4-diradicals from the
              photolysis of naphthocarboranes.

The study of reactive intermediates is
              expected to lead to improved syntheses of organic molecules.   The photolysis
              of naphthocarborane in the presence of supercoiled cyclic DNA caused efficient
              single strand cleavage, suggesting that the work could lead to biomedical
              applications.   The PI is known to be an outstanding educator, and we would
              expect that to continue under the continuing grant.
