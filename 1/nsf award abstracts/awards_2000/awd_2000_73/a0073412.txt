Abstract    :
              The lithium ion battery is a promising technology for electric energy storage. 
              Several materials-related issues are the subjects of intense research.  These
              issues include the design and synthesis of electrolytes with enhanced
              conductivity, and the interaction between charge carriers and electrode
              materials.  Detailed and accurate materials characterization is key to
              understanding the processes that underlie these phenomena.

To inform the
              scientific community of the current issues that control the progress of battery
              technology, to provide a platform for the exchange of ideas, and to stimulate
              new directions of research in this field, a symposium dedicated to battery
              materials will be held at the Annual Meeting of the American Crystallographic
              Association, July 22-27, 2000, in St. Paul, MN.  An outcome of the conference
              we expect to develop a vision and important directions for research in lithium
              ion battery technology.
