This project will investigate the classification, history,
              and biogeography of Bignonieae, a group of woody vines in the catalpa family
              (Bignoniaceae). Bignonieae, with 350 species and 47 genera, is the largest and
              most important group of woody vines in tropical regions of the Americas.  In
              some areas, they make up 20-25% of the species.  They are known for their
              strikingly ornamental flowers (such as the the trumpet-creeper, which occurs in
              the U.S.), their timber, and their medicinal value.  Despite their importance,
              Bignonieae are hard to identify, in part because we do not understand the
              relationships of the species.  The first goal of this project is to determine
              the phylogeny (i.e., genealogy) of Bignonieae using morphological and DNA data.
               From this phylogeny, the classification of Bignonieae will be revised, and
              patterns of morphological, ecological and biogeographical variation will be
              re-evaluated.

A better classification of Bignonieae will help in
              identification of this dominant component of neotropical forests.  The history
              of the Bignonieae mirrors the history of tropical regions in this hemisphere. 
              In an era when the increase in botanical knowledge cannot keep up with loss of
              diversity, allocation of resources to major components of tropical forests is a
              priority.
