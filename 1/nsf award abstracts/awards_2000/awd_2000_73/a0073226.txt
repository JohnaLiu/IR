Abstract    :
              Females of many species receive no tangible benefits from their mates, other
              than inseminations.  Although a single mating usually is sufficient to
              fertilize all of a female's eggs, some females will mate many times, even when
              mating may be costly (e.g., increased risk of predation).  Although earlier
              studies failed to identify particular benefits, this earlier work did not
              address events that may occur during a critical period.  This period occurs
              after insemination but before the sperm is used to fertilize eggs.  The
              proposed study will use a combination of laboratory and field investigations to
              examine why female multiple mating occurs in a terrestrial amphibian (a
              woodland salamander, Desmognathus ocoee).  In this species, the physiological
              mechanisms that act just prior to fertilization include sperm precedence, sperm
              competition, and female sperm choice.  These mechanisms are likely to mediate
              female benefits and therefore mating propensity.  
Mating strategies adopted
              by females can have important consequences for reproductive success, and
              therefore for conservation efforts.  Although conservation research has largely
              focused on aquatic-breeding amphibians (especially frogs), terrestrial
              amphibians also are important study systems.  The proposed investigations will
              provide a unique opportunity to gain insight into what may be common
              fundamental processes affecting female multiple mating.
