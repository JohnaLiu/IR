This project will discern the evolutionary lability of the
              visual system in the bluefin killifish.   Males exhibit one of several
              different color patterns.  Lighting conditions (e.g. water clarity, tree cover)
              are good predictors of the relative abundance of male color morphs within a
              population.  Because these color patterns are used in signaling females, the
              visual system might vary among populations so that it mitigates the color
              schemes used by males in each population. This project will quantify the
              pattern of variation in vision physiology across populations with different
              lighting regimes and the amount of variation within populations attributable to
              genetics, environment, and their interactions.  Experiments will be performed
              which examine the effect of male color patterns on animal behavior and the
              response of vision physiology to artificial selection.  

The ultimate
              objective of this study is to determine whether natural selection can act on
              sensory systems or whether sensory systems are invariant (and, therefore acts
              as a constraint to natural selection). This question is central to many debates
              in biology (e.g. evolution of senescence, genome size, plasticity).  If
              physiology can readily respond to selection, predictions can be made as to what
              should happen to populations over time with models involving few constraints
              due to a lack of genetic variation.  If, however, physiology is invariant, then
              these constraints must be incorporated into our models - potentially resulting
              in drastically different predictions.
