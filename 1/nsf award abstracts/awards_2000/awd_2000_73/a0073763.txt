Understanding the geometry and nature of fluid
              flow in the earth's upper crust is critically important to a number of
              geoscience disciplines related to societal and industrial activities, including
              petroleum geology, ore deposit geology, hydrogeology, geothermal energy, and
              seismic hazard analysis.  Crustal fluid flow is commonly controlled by
              structural permeability of fault and fracture networks.  Although
              fault-fracture flow networks have been studied extensively through modeling and
              2-D field studies, few 3-D field studies have been undertaken on ancient flow
              networks.  Zn-Pb deposits in the Canning basin of Western Australia provide a
              unique natural laboratory to investigate crustal fluid flow in 3-D. 
              Metalliferous basinal brines flowed along fault-fracture networks as the basin
              compacted and dewatered, and deposited metal sulfide minerals when the fluids
              reached permeable, reactive carbonate formations. The area was unaffected by
              deformation following mineralization.  We propose to build a 3-D model of the
              paleo-flow network by mapping the distribution of sulfide minerals, deposited
              along faults and fractures, using superb 2-D surface exposure, 3-D underground
              exposures, 500+ kilometers of diamond drill core, and extensive seismic
              reflection, aeromagnetic, and gravity data. Cross-cutting vein relationships
              and petrographically determined sulfide parageneses will be used to determine
              the relative timing of mineralizing events, thus extending the model to 4-D
              (time).
