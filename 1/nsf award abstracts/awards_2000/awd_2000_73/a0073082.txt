Plant disease resistance genes, involved in the
              recognition of invading pathogens, have been a subject of intense research in
              the past decade.  This has culminated in the identification of a handful of
              resistance genes, mostly in crop plants.  However, little is known about the
              evolution of resistance genes in natural populations.  This project will focus
              on the evolution of Cf-2, one of the few resistance genes to have been
              identified in a noncrop species.  Allelic diversity of the Cf-2 gene in wild
              populations of Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium, a close relative of the tomato,
              will be surveyed to establish levels of within- and between-population
              diversity.  This genetic variation will be analyzed with respect to the
              geneological relationships among Cf-2 alleles, geographical location,
              resistance phenotype, and the effects of natural selection.  These analyses
              will reveal the microevolutionary processes that have shaped Cf-2's
              evolution.

Plant resistance genes offer a unique opportunity to study how
              selection and other population-level processes affect an ecologically important
              trait at the molecular level.  The study of adaptation at this level has
              traditionally been hindered by lack of knowledge of specific genes and their
              functions.  Resistance genes thus emerge as ideal candidates to elucidate the
              evolutionary dynamics of molecular adaptation.  Furthermore, knowledge of the
              mechanisms underlying resistance gene function and evolution is important for
              the continuing management of crop systems and the pests which threaten
              them.
