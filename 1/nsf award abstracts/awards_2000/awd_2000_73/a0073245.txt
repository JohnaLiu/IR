Speciation is the process whereby a single reproductively
              unified group of organisms diverges into two such groups.  Little is known
              about the types of genes that generate reproductive isolation.  The experiments
              outlined in this proposal aim to identify candidate genes contributing to
              reproductive isolation between two fruit fly species, Drososphila simulans and
              D. mauritiana.  Although these species can hybridize, postmating reproductive
              isolation still exists due to the preferential fertilization of eggs by sperm
              of conspecific males.  The chromosomal regions of genes that influence both
              male and female components of this sperm competition trait will be localized
              through genetic mapping.  

By pondering a mechanism to explain the origin of
              species, Charles Darwin elucidated the theory of evolution via natural
              selection.  Much progress in the field of evolutionary biology has been made
              since the introduction of this seminal theory.  However, the process of
              speciation is still a mystery, particularly at the genetic level.  The results
              of this study will help identify "speciation genes" that can be subjected to
              various analyses, and ultimately contribute to a general understanding of
              mechanisms of speciation.
