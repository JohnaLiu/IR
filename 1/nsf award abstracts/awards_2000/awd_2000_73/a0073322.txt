Abstract    :
              Male animals may use several different behaviors to obtain mates. In the case of
              the green treefrog, some males remain silently positioned next to a calling
              male and attempt to intercept females attracted to that caller (satellite
              mating tactic). Using multiple speaker playbacks of frog calls to simulate and
              control a socially complex environment, investigations of how a male's ability
              to compete with other individuals for access to mates influences his use of
              different mating behaviors
will be conducted. It will also be determined
              whether males adopting the satellite mating behavior take advantage of female
              call preferences for mates by becoming satellites of attractive males, thereby
              maximizing the benefits of the behavior. 

Behavioral differences among
              individuals may have a purely genetic basis; however, individuals in many
              species are flexible in their behavioral choices and adopt the tactic that best
              fits their current
needs. Scientists have a relatively poor understanding why
              individual behavioral variation exists and how the animal's social environment
              may mediate this behavioral variation. This study will contribute to our
              understanding of how male-male competition and female mate choice shape
a
              behaviorally complex mating system.
