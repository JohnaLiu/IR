              ABSTRACT
An extension of a meshless method for the numerical solution
              of
partial differential equations based on radial basis functions
              is
proposed. In particular, the combination of (1) radial
basis functions,
              (2) compact support, and (3) multilevel algorithms is
suggested for the
              collocation solution of nonlinear partial
differential equations. In this
              manner accurate and computationally 
efficient algorithms can be designed. The
              research focuses on the
implementation of these algorithms, as well as the
              investigation of
some related theoretical issues such as convergence rates
              and
well-posedness. 

Partial differential equations play an important role
              in many areas of
science and engineering. They are at the core of many
              mathematical
models used, e.g., meteorological models, molecular simulations
              in
chemistry and physics, simulations in such areas as
              semiconductor
modeling, study of materials, fluid dynamics, etc.. In this
              project we
focus on the design of algorithms potentially applicable to any
              of
these areas. Algorithms for high-performance parallel hardware are
also
              considered. The tools employed (radial basis functions) are of
fairly recent
              origin (1980s), but are slowly being accepted by a
growing number of
              scientists and engineers. Their main advantage is
that no complicated (and
              expensive) underlying mesh structure is
required as is for the standard finite
              element or finite volume
techniques.
