This project will conduct a joint study of
              seismic structure, composition and dynamics of the mantle, with a strategic
              focus on Africa.  Combining seismic forward waveform modeling and travel time
              inversion, we will attempt to map the geometry, magnitude and sharpness of
              seismic anomalies throughout the mantle beneath Africa.  With improved seismic
              models of the lower and upper mantle, we will also study the geodynamical and
              compositional aspects of mantle anomalies using other geophysical constraints,
              including geoid, topography at the Earth's surface and the core-mantle
              boundary, intra-plate stress, plate motions, and experimental results from
              mineral physics.
