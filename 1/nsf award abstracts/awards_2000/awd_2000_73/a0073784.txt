Abstract    :
              Yellowstone National Park (YNP) represents a unique setting wherein significant
              geothermal activity occurs. These thermal areas include aquatic systems as well
              as soils, and vary significantly with respect to temperature, chemistry, and
              physical properties.  There is an exceptional opportunity to observe, follow,
              and quantify changes in a soil microbial population that occur in response to
              elevated temperature.  Typically, environments that are the focus of
              thermophile investigations are mature, established geothermal features
              (relative to the human experience and known records).  This preemptive study
              will take advantage of naturally occurring temperature gradients that have
              recently surfaced across the landscape at one specific location in YNP.  These
              recent changes provide a rare opportunity, whereby thermophiles and/or the
              development of thermophile communities can be studied in real time.  As opposed
              to other neothermal environments such as deep sea vents which are logistically
              difficult to access, the research site is easily accessible and sampled.  Using
              a combination of molecular and culturing techniques, the microbial community in
              this evolving thermal environment is being studied over time, with apparent
              alterations in community structure being correlated with changes in soil
              temperature and chemical properties.
