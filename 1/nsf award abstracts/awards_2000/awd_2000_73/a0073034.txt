Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include a study of an
              incomplete phase transition in a hidden sector of space-time as the cause of
              the apparent accelerated expansion of the universe; work on the relation
              between recently observed neutrino masses and the dominance of matter over
              antimatter; and an investigation of the significance of clustering of high
              energy cosmic rays as a clue to their elementary particle content. 
              Increasingly, research at the intersection of elementary particle physics and
              cosmology has provided important clues to the structure of the universe and the
              laws of physics which govern it.
