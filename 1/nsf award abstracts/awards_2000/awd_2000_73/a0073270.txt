Abstract    :
              Differences in population density are often reflected in social behavior yet the
              pathways and mechanisms remain to be elucidated, particularly in natural
              populations. This research on a wild population of the prosimian, Lemur catta,
              uses endocrine responses to identify the relative contributions of several
              ecological and social stressors to density-dependent changes in behavior,
              physiology, and reproductive success.  The study benefits from unique field
              conditions in which six habituated primate groups are studied across a
              well-documented population-density gradient, and research methods have been
              established for obtaining individual-level data on survival, reproduction,
              foraging efficiency, aggressive behavior, and levels of stress response as
              measured by excreted steroids sampled without intervention. The data for
              approximately 80 animals over a two-year period permit testing the hypotheses
              that food scarcity, conflicts within groups, and conflicts between groups are
              reflected to varying degrees in cortisol levels and that the magnitude of this
              stress response predicts individual health and short-term reproductive success.
