Biological invasions are governed by processes that affect
              establishment of colonizers and growth of populations. The investigators are
              currently examining invasions by graminoids in the Everglades region of south
              Florida by 1) using functional groups to develop hypotheses about invasiveness
              and the role of certain life history characteristics, and 2) following
              established populations of certain species, including one exotic invader, to
              better understand factors influencing growth and survival of established plants
              in this system. The proposed dissertation research will investigate factors
              that may be important in determining early invasion success of these
              graminoids. Work will occur in upland pine savannas of the Everglades National
              Park with species of Cyperaceae and Poaceae. Propagule and rhizome addition
              experiments will examine germination, establishment, survival and growth of
              individuals from species with a range of life history strategies, morphologies,
              growth forms, and invasive tendencies in four distinct microsites. The main
              objective of the study is to determine the role of early life cycle stages in
              limiting colonization of different savanna microsites by native and exotics.
              This study, together with the rest of the dissertation research, will be used
              to make habitat-specific invasion predictions.
