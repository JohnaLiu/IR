              Abstract

It is proposed to examine and quantify the batch coating of large
              particles. Such  chemical coats may have in addition the role of controlling
              the rate of release of specified chemicals from the particles themselves. In
              many important industrial applications (such as pharmaceuticals , for
              instance), predictability of the chemical process is essential. Thus, it is
              critical that each particle be coated in as much uniformity with the next one
              as possible. To accomplish this goal by the traditional hit and miss sequence
              of experiments, from laboratory to factory floor, is frustrating and
              expensive.
      The proposed effort is to establish the basic theory of the
              "drum"coating process, by a combination of scalable experiments and generic
              modeling of the results.  The experiments will identify those conditions where
              coating will be uniform across the sample under study. The modeling techniques
              will be borrowed from renewal theory, supplemented by mechanistic
              representations of the component processes (such as "avalanching") . High speed
              imaging will provide a description of  the behavior of the coated material over
              time. The model which will emerge of the laboratory experiments will be
              verified at the associated industrial sites (Merck, Alza).
