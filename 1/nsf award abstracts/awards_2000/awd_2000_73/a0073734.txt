A significant portion of our planet's water may be held
              within the atomic structures of minerals in the mantle. The presence of
              structurally-bound water in the form of hydroxyl ion (OH-) or molecular  water
              (H2O) can lower the melting temperatures of rocks, affect the character of
              volcanic activity and may even generate the forces that cause earthquakes.
              Therefore, it is important to understand how water (hydrogen) affects the
              properties of hydrous minerals at pressure-temperature conditions
              representative of the mantle. With the recent development of high-pressure,
              neutron facilities, atomic-level information on the behavior of hydrogen at
              mantle pressures can be obtained from small-volume (90 mm3), powdered samples.
              The majority of minerals that have been studied using this technique have
              relatively simple atomic structures.  In this project, high-pressure data will
              be obtained for the first time on structurally-complex minerals (humites) using
              both neutron and X-ray data collected for the same sample. X-rays will give the
              precision required for the heavier atoms (metals and oxygen) in these
              structures. Neutrons can then be used to determine the hydrogen-atom positions.
              Using these complementary measurements, it should be possible to improve both
              the accuracy and precision of the experiments and learn more about how changes
              in the hydrogen-atom environment at high pressure affect the compression of
              these minerals. In a related experiment, infrared spectra will be collected for
              humite minerals and correlated to neutron data on the hydrogen-atom
              environment.  The objective is use the atomic structure of humite as a model to
              understand the mode of incorporation of trace amounts of hydrogen in olivine,
              the predominant mineral in the mantle.
