Numerous short-duration explosions occurred during
              August, September and October 1997, at the Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat,
              West Indies. These eruptions were accompanied by gravity collapse of heavy
              parts of the eruption column, that produced pumice and ash flows (pyroclastic
              flows) and "ash hurricanes" that moved sideways, into adjacent farmlands and
              formerly populated areas.  Many of these eruptions were predicted, and we and
              other staff of Montserrat Volcano Observatory closely documented the eruptions
              by continuous seismic monitoring, measured surveys of the eruption
              clouds,
photography, and video. Such data are rare, and in this project, we
              aim to quantify these eruptions, including the speed and trajectory of the
              explosion clouds, and then to compare these field-based data to sophisticated
              models of the eruptions. In our modeling, we will attempt to identify the magma
              and gas ratios in the eruption conduit before the explosion, and the pressure
              distribution. Then we will use this information as the starting condition for a
              "multi-phase" explosion model, in which separated solid and gas phases are
              allowed to expand dynamically upon release from the conduit tube. We can track
              the speeds and trajectories of the particles emitted from the conduit, and the
              particle densities of the
erupting particle-and-gas cloud. We hope from this
              study to establish the main conditions in the conduit that control whether the
              clouds will continue to rise vertically, or will collapse to form dangerous
              pyroclastic flows. Pyroclastic flows are the major cause of loss of life in
              explosive eruptions worldwide, and the improved understanding obtained from
              this project should help to reduce hazards at a number of locations in this
              country and abroad.
