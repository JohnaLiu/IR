Abstract    :
              This Americas Program award will support travel and related expenses for US
              scientists to participate in an international workshop on Global Change
              Modeling to be held in Brasilia, Brazil July 9-21, 2000.  The US organizer is
              Dork Sahagian of the University of New Hampshire, and his Brazilian
              co-organizer is Carlos Nobre from INPE in Brazil.  The workshop will help to
              develop modeling capabilities of the research community working in Large-Scale
              Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiments in Amazonia (LBA), train participants in
              ecological modeling using "hands-on" experience, and foster collaboration
              between Amazonian scientists and US and other researchers for joint
              international projects.  Participants will be selected from early to mid-career
              researchers who are in the strongest position to contribute regional data and
              understanding to the workshop and disseminate the capabilities obtained to
              their colleagues and students.

The workshop takes an Amazonian focus within
              a global context and is oriented toward education and outreach rather than
              actual model development.  The issues addressed in this workshop are central to
              the activities of the Task Force on Global Analysis, Interpretation, and
              Modeling (GAIM), an element of the International Geosphere Biosphere Program
              (IGBP).
