Indexing and Reorganization in Parallel Database Systems

The goal of
              this research project is to design, analyze and simulate restartable algorithms
              for on-line reorganization in parallel database management systems (DBMSs). The
              growing need for 7/24 (7 days a week/24 hours a day) database access for web
              applications makes development of these algorithms urgent. Applications such as
              those found in telecommunications and web-based businesses (for example, eBay
              or AOL) require very large highly available databases. These are or will soon
              be managed by parallel DBMSs (i.e., DBMSs on clusters of workstations, each
              managing its own collections of disks, connected by Local Area Networks
              (LANs)), so parallel algorithms to maintain availability in the face of logical
              and physical changes to the database as well as unexpected growth are
              important. The approach deployed in the project includes the description of
              explicit logging operations to assure consistency and preserve incremental
              improvements in the face of possible system failures at any node of the
              parallel system. Collaboration with industry is part of the project. Ms.
              Xiaowei Sun, a supported Ph.D. student on the project, has completed an
              internship at Clustra, Inc., whose product is a parallel replicated DBMS
              designed for high availability. She is also doing an internship with IBM
              Toronto on online reorganization for IBM's DBMS, DB2. The close contact with
              industry and the current importance of the problem of online reorganization
              will strengthen the impact of this project's results, including the expected
              technology
              transfer.
