              ABSTRACT

Title: Understanding and Improving Memory System Performance via a
              New Approach to Cache Analysis and Access ordering
PI: Sally McKee, University
              of Utah

Microprocessor speed is increasing much faster than memory system
              speed: both speed-growth curves are exponential, but they represent diverging
              exponentials. This proposed research strives to develop a comprehensive
              approach to bridging the processor/memory performance gap by developing better
              measures of performance, better tools for observing memory system behavior and
              understanding memory usage patterns, and combined compiler and architectural
              schemes to exploit these patterns.

The first component of this research
              investigates methods and tools by which to better measure and interpret complex
              system behavior in the cache and memory hierarchy. The PI and others are
              developing a new framework for the analysis of caching systems; this new
              "caches as filters" framework focuses on properties of a memory trace rather
              than artifacts of a particular memory organization. This research will support
              the development of the tools and technology necessary to apply the new
              framework to real problems and systems.

The second component of this
              research investigates combined compiler and architectural approaches to
              improving memory system performance in modern microprocessors via smarter
              scheduling of memory activity and hardware support for streaming.
