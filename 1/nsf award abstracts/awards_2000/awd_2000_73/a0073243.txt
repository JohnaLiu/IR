DDIG: Identifying the sources and ages of
              organic matter supporting estuarine bacterial production: A novel multiple
              isotope approach


The effects of long-term changes in land use patterns are
              focused in the coastal zone. These changes have fundamentally altered both the
              magnitude and composition of riverine organic matter exported to the estuary.
              This, in turn, has the potential to shift the metabolic balance between
              production and respiration in the water column. This study will help to
              determine the role of bacteria in regulating estuarine metabolic balance by
              examining the size fractions, sources, and ages of estuarine dissolved organic
              matter (DOM) incorporated into bacterial biomass in the York River Estuary (a
              sub-estuary of the Chesapeake Bay). In addition, the PIs will experimentally
              investigate the fraction of DOM which can be metabolized on the time scale of
              estuarine residence times. The investigators will employ a novel approach,
              involving a multiple isotope, to overcome the traditional methodological
              limitations of research in this area.
