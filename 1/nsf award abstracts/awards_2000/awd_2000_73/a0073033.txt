Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for a Gordon Conference on the subject of
              "Correlated 
Electrons".  The conference will be held in Plymouth, NH, June
              25-30, 2000.  The conference seeks to bring  a wide variety of systems and
              intellectual issues into the mainstream of correlated electron physics and to
              introduce the techniques and concepts of the correlated electron field to a
              wider range of physicists.  Support for the conference will enable the
              participation of under-funded junior researchers and members of historically
              under-represented groups.
This award provides partial support for a Gordon
              Conference on the subject of "Correlated Electrons".  The conference will be
              held in Plymouth, NH, June 25-30, 2000.  The correlated electron problem
              underlies several major problems in solid state physics, including high
              temperature superconductivity and the so-called quantum Hall effects.  Support
              for the conference will enable the participation of under-funded junior
              researchers and members of historically under-represented groups.
