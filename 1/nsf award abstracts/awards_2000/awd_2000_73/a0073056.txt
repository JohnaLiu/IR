Abstract    :
              The inverse problem of matrix construction arises in many
areas of important
              applications. Matrices under construction
are supposed to satisfy certain
              specific constraints. The
constraints could be inherited intrinsically from
              the physical
feasibility of a certain mechanical structure or could be
driven
              extrinsically by the desirable property of a certain
design parameter. This
              proposal intends to extend the
investigation that the PI has been conducting
              in the past
years with emphasis on the the development of
              numerical
algorithms for application to challenging inverse problems.
Four
              specific inverse problems of matrix construction will
be studied via three
              possible numerical approaches. Techniques
to be used involves computer
              experiments, high resolution
graphics and symbolic manipulation, in
              conjunction with
mathematical analysis.  This project is expected to
              find
important applications ranging from new development of
numerical
              algorithms to theoretic solution of difficult
problems. Since matrix
              reconstruction with specified
properties arises from a remarkably wide area of
              disciplines,
the resulting technology would have substantial impact on
              the
progress in scientific and engineering fields.

In the era of
              information and digital technologies,
massive data processing becomes an
              imperative task
at almost every level of applications.  In many
              situations
the digitized information is gathered and stored as a data
matrix.
              Nonetheless, because most of the information
gathering devices or methods have
              only finite bandwidth, one
cannot avoid the fact that the data collected often
              are not
exact. Signals received by antenna arrays often are
contaminated by
              instrumental noises; astronomical images
acquired by telescopes often are
              blurred by atmospheric
turbulence; and even empirical data obtained in
              laboratories
often do not satisfy intrinsic physical constraints. Before
any
              forward analysis technique can be applied, it is important
to first
              reconstruct the data matrices so that the inexactness
is reduced while certain
              feasibility conditions are satisfied.
The general objective of this proposal
              is to develop numerical
algorithms to carry out this kind of data
              reconstruction task.
The work in this proposal concerns the mathematical
              theory and
the numerical implementation of three algorithms for four
specific
              inverse construction problems. This investigation
could lead to improved
              techniques for use in several national
strategic areas, including ground-based
              astro-imaging
processing, medicine, communications, and laser technology.
