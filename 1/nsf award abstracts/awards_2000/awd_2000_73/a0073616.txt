Abstract    :
              OIA-0073616

This Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy
              (COSEPUP) study on Accountability of Federally-Funded Research will assist
              federal agencies in crafting plans and reports that are responsive to the
              Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), Office of Management and Budget
              (OMB) Guidance, and agency missions. The study will undertake independent
              assessments via case studies of the strategic and performance plans federal
              agencies have developed and of the responsiveness of their performance reports
              to GPRA.

This case study approach of agency responses to GPRA from strategic
              plan through performance plan and performance report will be valuable to
              agencies in providing a bridge between congressional expectations and agency
              capabilities. The case study approach will allow for the special circumstances
              of individual agencies-both their missions and how they implement them.
