Research will be undertaken to advance the understanding
              of the mechanisms and properties of bonded interactions in earth materials and
              representative molecules and to locate, at the atomic level, the surface and
              internal sites that are susceptible to electrophilic and nucleophilic attack.
              These goals will be accomplished by evaluating the bond critical point
              properties of the calculated electron density distributions for a wide variety
              of minerals and by determining the properties and locating the local maxima and
              minima in the Laplacian distributions for the valence shell electrons of the
              bonded atoms. A knowledge of the location and structure of the internal and
              surface sites that are susceptible to attack by Lewis acids and bases will
              clarify the mechanisms, the structural details and the properties of the
              reactions involved in weathering and other important geochemical processes. The
              resulting information should provide a theoretical basis for modeling surface
              and internal reactions of earth materials, leading to a better understanding of
              processes involving mineral surfaces.
