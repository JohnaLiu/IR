This grant will evaluate
              alternative information integration architectures, using as a testbed the
              Federal Electronic Research and Review Tool (FERRET).  FERRET has been
              developed by the US Bureau of the Census, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and
              Centers for Disease Control to support dataset extraction and cross-tabulation
              of data collected by the Census' Current Population Survey.  An additional
              partner will be the San Diego Association of Governments.  The goals are to
              evaluate the scalability of the FERRET architecture and consider how emerging
              technologies such XML may be applied within that architecture.
