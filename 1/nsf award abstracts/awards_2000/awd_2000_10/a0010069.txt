Abstract    :
              This small grant for preliminary research provides funding for analysis and
              synthesis of self-aligning grippers and fixtures, with an emphasis on
              demonstrating how 2D methods extend to 3D.  Small variations in initial part
              position and orientation can lead to jamming, slippage, and damage as
              industrial parts are grasped or inserted into fixtures.  Although manufacturing
              engineers have designed self-aligning grippers based on intuition, the goal is
              to define optimal solutions that depend on detailed part geometry and the
              mechanics of pushing, toppling, jamming, and accessibility.  Algorithms will be
              developed that take as input a CAD model of the part and generate as output
              specifications for self-aligning grippers and fixtures.  The investigator and
              one Ph.D. student will implement such grippers and perform mechanical
              experiments using the industrial robot in the lab to study part mechanics and
              performance in terms of Mean Time Between Failure.

This project should
              produce new theoretical models of the mechanics of part acquisition, new data
              structures, and new hardware configurations that will improve the reliability
              of automated industrial manufacturing systems.  The gripper hardware will be
              inexpensive and have near-term applicability.  Self-aligning grippers can
              simplify assembly, increase reliability, decrease implementation cost, and
              facilitate setup for a broad range of manufacturing applications.
