This proposal will develop and establish a new course at the
              Salish Kootenai College (SKC), a tribal college located in northwestern
              Montana.  This new course will be one in a series of three needed upper level
              courses covering the topic of Environmental Chemistry.  This is an area of
              weakness in the current SKC Environmental Sciences Program.  The subject of the
              course will be the source, fate, effects, etc. of organic pollutants in the
              environment.  This will compliment another course dealing with similar issues
              as they pertain to inorganic pollutants.  This new course also has a laboratory
              component that will serve as a vehicle to familiarize tribal students with the
              basic concepts of organic, analytical chemistry.  Therefore, included in this
              project is the purchase a gas chromatography and a liquid chromatography
              system.  These instruments are necessary for the analysis of the typically
              encountered organic pollutants:  volatilizable organic compounds, such as
              pesticides, fuels and fuel additives (MTBE) and plant constituents, and
              non-volatilizable compounds such as herbicides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and
              plant constituents
The instrumentation is integral to the new course to
              achieve one of the major goals:  training tribal students in the analysis of
              environmental samples for organic pollutants.  Additionally, the
              instrumentation will provide a valuable, needed resource that will vastly
              improve the on-going, successful senior research projects at SKC.  These
              activities will also add substantially to the preparedness and, hopefully the
              enthusiasm, of SKC graduates in Environmental Science for both the workplace
              and graduate school.  
Overall, this proposal addresses the need to integrate
              state-of-the-art technology and education to provide for a complete student
              experience while supporting the development of Native American scientists,
              which are the most underrepresented population group in the scientific arena.
