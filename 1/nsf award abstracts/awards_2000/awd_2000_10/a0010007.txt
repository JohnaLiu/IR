Abstract    :
              This RUI project focuses on the study of fundamental problems in strong field
              coherent control, particularly as applied to ladder systems in Rydberg atoms.  
              Four specific areas are targeted:  1) extensions of stimulated Raman adiabatic
              passage techniques to three-level systems; 2) the use of chirped pulses for
              climbing anharmonic ladders; 3) the exploration of the use of feedback-control
              systems applied to the ladder climbing problem, in particular the robustness of
              various learning algorithms; and 4) the creation of arbitrary Stark wavepacket
              states using radiofrequency pulses.
