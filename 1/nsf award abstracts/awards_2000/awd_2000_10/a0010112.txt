              Title: Collaborative Research: Propagation of Uncertainties in Nonlinear Frame
              Analysis of RC
Buildings for Performance-Based Seismic Engineering
Summary:
              This is a collaborative research project, with separate awards requested,
              between research teams at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the
              University of California at Los Angeles. The purpose of this research is to
              develop and implement the general methodology and to test it on a set of
              benchmark RC frames.  The awarded project will merge state-of-the-art
              techniques in nonlinear frame analysis with state-of-the-art methods in
              sensitivity and reliability analysis to develop a general methodology for
              assessing the effects of propagation of uncertainties in nonlinear dynamic
              analyses of reinforced concrete buildings for performance-based engineering.
              The following sources of inherent and epistemic uncertainties will be
              considered in the study: (a) intrinsic variabilities/randomness in the 
              material properties; (b) inherent and epistemic uncertainties in the "global"
              seismological variables (earthquake magnitude M, site-to-source distance R, and
              local site condition S); (c) intrinsic variabilities/randomness in the
              earthquake loading history; and (d) modeling uncertainties associated with the
              nonlinear RC frame models and the stochastic earthquake excitation model.
