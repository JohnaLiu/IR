Abstract    :
              The proposed work addresses the problem of reliable robotic assembly. The
              project seeks to develop powerful computer techniques  to ensure proper
              assembly of 3D polyhedral parts undergoing 6d spatial motions. The work will
              culminate in custom-aided-design software capable of 1) assessment of whether
              two parts can be reliably assembled using only contact forces as environmental
              input, and 2) producing a description of the "best admittance" behavior for the
              specified task.
