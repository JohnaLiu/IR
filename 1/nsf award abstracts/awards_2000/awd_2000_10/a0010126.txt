Abstract    :
              Use of FRP composites for strengthening of existing structures have rapidly
              increased in the last decade. However, in applications, some fundamental
              aspects are still not well understood, specifically those related to
              performance and behavior of FRP-retrofitted members under cyclic loading and
              the role of environmental effects on this behavior. The proposed research,
              through rigorous experimental, analytical, and numerical studies, will
              contribute to better understanding of retrofitted systems behavior under
              monotonic and cyclic loads combined with environmental effects. This will form
              a basis for development of an integrated design methodology for safe
              applications and for better assessment of durability of such systems, which are
              becoming widespread around the world.
