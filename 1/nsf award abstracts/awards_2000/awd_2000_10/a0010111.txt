This U.S.-Czech research project between David Schriver
              of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Petr Hellinger of the
              Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Prague, examines the physical characteristics
              of wave processes in space plasmas through use of numerical simulations and
              advanced data analysis. The Czech participants who have strengths in numerical
              plasma simulation methods also belong to the European Wave Experimental
              Consortium and bring a source of new experimental data to this effort from
              CLUSTER II (a four satellite project of the European Space Agency).  The U.S.
              team contributes expertise in analytical theory and other numerical
              simulations, including particle-in-cell and Vlasov codes. The researchers
              expect to draw upon their comparisons of experimental and simulation data to
              explain observed phenomena in key regions including solar wind, bow shock,
              magnetotail and magnetopause, polar cusp and auroral zone.  Results of their
              collaboration should contribute to our fundamental understanding of waves and
              wave-particle interactions in the Earth's magnetosphere. 

This atmospheric
              sciences project featuring magnetospheric physics fulfils the program objective
              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and
              Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
