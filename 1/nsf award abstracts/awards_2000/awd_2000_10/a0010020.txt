Abstract    :
              This proposal supports participation of the PI and undergraduate
students in
              research conducted at the Low Energy Nuclear Accelerator
laboratory (LENA).
              The main focus of these measurements will be low
energy p-gamma reactions of
              astrophysical interest. Since many
measurements of astrophysical interest
              involve very low counting  rates
and large backgrounds, computational routines
              will be used to aid in the
design of a detector for LENA which maximizes
              efficiency and minimizes
background. The proposal will also support
              participation of the PI and
undergraduate students in data collection and
              analysis for experiments
done at LENA. The first proposed experiments after
              completion of the
laboratory are, 14-Nitrogen (p-gamma) 15-Oxygen with results
              expected to
reduce the uncertainty in S(0), and 25-Magnesim (p-gamma)
              26-Aluminum
addressing reaction rates for low-lying resonances corresponding
              to
lower stellar temperatures.
