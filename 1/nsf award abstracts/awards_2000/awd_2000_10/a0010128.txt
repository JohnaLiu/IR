Abstract    :
              Professor George Majetich in the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Georgia is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for
              his research on the efficient syntheses of four triterpene natural products. 
              The natural products will be synthesized from a common intermediate using a
              biomimetic cascade strategy to form three rings and  several carbon-carbon
              bonds and asymmetric centers in one step.  The stereochemistry of one of the
              triterpene natural products, peradione, has been previously determined by NMR
              analysis and is possibly incorrect.   New insight into the correct
              stereochemistry of peradione will be achieved  by the total synthesis of the
              preferred stereoisomer.

With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program, Professor George Majetich is developing new, more efficient
              ways to synthesize four structurally-related natural products.  The synthetic
              pathways of these four organic compounds proceed through a common intermediate.
               In 1999 these natural products were isolated from a plant found in Central
              Asia which is used for treating liver disorders.  There is a question as to
              whether the three-dimensional structure of one of these organic compounds has
              been correctly assigned.  Professor Majetich's research should resolve this
              ambiguity.
