Abstract    :
              A conference in honor of Ernie Shult will be held at Kansas State University,
              from March 22 through March 25, 2001. The conference will involve approximately
              thirty talks on those parts of algebra and geometry  to which Professor Shult
              has made significant contributions in a long and distinguished career. Thus,
              the conference will be concerned with developments in the theory of finite
              simple groups, with geometries related to those groups, and with
              generalizations of such geometries.

Group theory can be described as the
              algebra associated with symmetry, and finite groups in particular afford a rich
              mathematical structure and wealth of applications. The finite simple groups may
              be viewed as the "atoms" of which all finite groups are composed, and for this
              reason, the announcement, twenty years ago, of the classification of the finite
              simple groups was a milestone in mathematics. The conference will focus on
              developments which promise to provide, perhaps for the first time, a
              satisfactory treatment of this fundamental result. The interplay between
              geometry and group theory has always been enriching for both subjects and will
              provide a second focus for this conference.
