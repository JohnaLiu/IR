This theoretical study addresses the formation of quantum dots and
              wires by self assembly.  The study will address the effect of several
              fabrication parameters on the stability, growth and restructuring of thin
              multi-component solid films on single-component substrates.  Surface and bulk
              diffusions appear to be two major mechanisms. The effort will begin with a
              re-derivation of the governing equations for thermochemical responses of
              multiphase solids under stress.  The objective is to recapture the factors that
              have been heretofore thought to be negligible. More specifically, the theory
              will be reexamined for completeness and generality in chemical potential, with
              particular emphasis on the role of mismatch parameter. Analytical
              considerations will include, but not limited to, the morphological and
              compositional instabilities of multi-component solids, and the effect of
              substrate pattern generated by non-lithographic methods, such as the periodic
              strain field of a buried misfit dislocation network or a compliant substrate,
              on self-organization.  The proposed investigation is expected to have a
              significant impact on the ongoing effort in producing nano-scale semiconductor
              islands of uniform size and distribution.  Such self-organized small structures
              are thought to be the future of new electronic devices in just 15 or 20 years
              when conventional transistors and circuits can not be miniaturized further.  In
              this way, the project will have contributed to the advance of another milestone
              technology, as well as to the understanding of a new phenomenon in the
              micron-to-nano range.
