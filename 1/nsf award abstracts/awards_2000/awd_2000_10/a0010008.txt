Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this project is to understand the lubrication and
              friction conditions in Tube Hydroforming processes. By achieving the project
              objectives it will be possible to evaluate various candidate lubricants
              regarding their suitability and application in tube hydroforming. The
              lubricants to be evaluated must be environmentally friendly and non polluting
              while providing adequate lubricity and a low coefficient of friction. Thus, it
              will be possible to improve process conditions and part quality. 

Tube
              Hydroforming is a relatively new process that is being used increasingly in
              manufacturing automotive components. The process offers advantages in reducing
              part weight and assembly operations, and in  increasing part stiffness and
              properties. In tube hydroforming a tubular preform is placed between two die
              halves, the preform is internally pressurized while the tube ends are fed or
              pushed axially towards the die center. Thus, the tubular preform is expanded to
              achieve the internal geometry of the dies, hopefully without defects, i.e.
              fracture or wrinkles. The results of this project will improve lubrication
              conditions in tube hydroforming and will make the process more reliable,
              robust, cost effective and more widely used.
