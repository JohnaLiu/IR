This award provides funds to
              partially support the conference Nonparametrics
in Large, Multidimensional
              Data Mining. The money is used to support junior
researchers and Ph.D.
              students who will attend the conference. Women and
minority young
              investigators and Ph.D. students will be actively recruited
and encouraged to
              apply. The two-day conference will be held at Southern
Methodist University,
              Dallas, Texas, on January 12-13, 2001, and will bring 
together a group of
              experts from industry, computer science and statistics to discuss
cutting-edge
              research activities in the areas of data mining and knowledge
discovery in
              databases. This holistic approach is necessary to push the
research frontiers
              in these important disciplines. Leading researchers will
present new
              nonparametric developments in an environment that is conducive
to the
              development of new human resources.
