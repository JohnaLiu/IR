Abstract    :
              This award provides support for acquisition of a modern light microscope for
              shared use by faculty, graduate and undergraduate students investigating
              problems in microbial ecology, vertebrate neurobiology, and plant physiology.. 
              Recent technical advances in microscopy have revolutionized understanding of
              the biological world by permitting, among others, the tracing of functional
              consequences of trace gene expression and the inference of subcellular and
              genetic structure.  The funds provided will aid in purchase of a
              research-grade, inverted light microscope with flexible fluorescence and
              digital imaging capabilities.  The instrument will enable research in three
              specific areas: microbial behavioral ecology and genetic diversity in
              environmental samples, mammalian neuronal synaptogenesis, and plant cellular
              morphogenesis. The instrument will also be used to improve laboratory course
              experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, and to introduce students
              to modern techniques for the quantitative visualization of cellular
              information.
