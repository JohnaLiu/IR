Abstract    :
              This project focuses on precision laser spectroscopic studies of basic atoms and
              nuclei.  The fine structure of the 2P state of the helium atom will be measured
              with an electro-optic technique in order to determine a newly competitive
              atomic physics source for the fine structure constant alpha.  Additional
              experiments, using various optical and laser techniques, will be performed to
              (1) provide sensitive tests of some of the newest calculations and techniques
              in theoretical atomic physics and (2) test recent calculations in few-body
              nuclear theory and their underlying assumptions about the nuclear force.
