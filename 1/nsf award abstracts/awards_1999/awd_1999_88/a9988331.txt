Abstract    :
              As CMOS technology advances into the 80 nanometer generation and beyond, the
              manufacturing process is having an increasingly constraining effect on physical
              layout design and verification.  To maximize yield, process engineers must
              achieve predictability and uniformity of manufactured device and interconnect
              attributes.  This project investigates newly critical issues in the interface
              between layout design and manufacturability, such as layout modification for
              reduced variability of chemical-mechanical polishing, design which is amenable
              to optical lithography using phase-shifting masks and optical proximity
              correction, and other problems.  This project is developing robust testbeds,
              algorithms and tools to address these important problems, and is interacting
              with industry partners to tailor the proposed approaches to address real
              objectives on actual test cases and production runs.
