Abstract    :
              Brigham Young University proposes a continuation of their successful REU site. 
              Based on our past experience and geographical location we expect this site to
              be particularly attractive to women, minority students, and students from
              two-year and four-year colleges in the Intermountain West.  Participating
              students will participate in a ten week summer physics research program in
              computational and experimental plasma phyhsics, optics, experimental and
              computational concensed matter physics, x-ray and XUV sources and optics,
              observational astronomy, acoustics, microfabrication technology, solar power,
              or advanced physical methods applied to archeology.  The students will receive
              instruction in experimental and computational techniques, participate in an
              ongoing research project, and present oral and written reports of their
              research activities here and at regional professional meetings.  Through close
              contact with a faculty mentor (both during and after the program), they will
              taste the excitement of physics research and receive training in professional
              ethics and standards.
