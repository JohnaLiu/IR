Dr. Bruce Carney at the University of North Carolina and
              Dr. John Laird at Bowling Green State University are pursuing a series of
              observational projects which are meant to reveal how the thin disk, the thick
              disk, and the halo star populations of our Galaxy were assembled.  For the halo
              population, they will study s-process and r-process abundances in normal and
              extreme velocity field stars that were identified in a survey of high proper
              motion stars they recently completed.  For the thick disk, they will measure
              stellar radial velocities and metallicities to obtain a clearer view of the
              relation between three-dimensional motions and Galactic orbits with
              metallicity.  For the thin disk, they will obtain spectra of metal-poor and
              metal-rich stars for direct comparison with the thick disk stars.  From the
              data sets, these investigators will obtain a homogeneously studied sample from
              which to achieve a much clearer view of the chemical evolution of these stellar
              populations.  This award is made through the Galactic Astronomy Program in the
              Division of Astronomical Sciences.
