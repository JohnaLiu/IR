Characterized by high-strain low-cycle conditions,
              earthquake-induced fractures such as those observed in the 1994 Northridge and
              1995 Kobe earthquakes are quite different from low-strain high-cycle fatigue
              fractures that have been extensively studied in bridges. Techniques to analyze
              and predict high-strain (inelastic) fracture are not nearly as well developed
              as those for other limit states.  Thus, engineering  researchers currently rely
              almost exclusively on empirical data from full-scale tests to develop fracture
              resistant welded connection details.  The proposed research is to develop and
              apply computational methods for simulating inelastic earthquake-induced
              fractures with an emphasis on ductile crack initiation and growth.  The scope
              includes complementary computational (finite element) and experimental studies
              that will utilize state-of-the-art micro-mechanical models to analyze ductile
              cracking and its potential for triggering brittle cleavage fracture.  Detailed
              finite element analyses will include models that consider the interaction of
              plastic strains and stress triaxality that lead to void growth and coalescence.
               Results from the micro-mechanical models will be compared with conventional
              fracture indices (KI, J, CTOD), and physical tests will be used to both
              calibrate stress/strain and fracture toughness properties of base and weld
              metals and verify the simulations. Collaboration with researchers at the Nippon
              Steel Corporation and Chiba University will provide opportunities to study data
              from extensive Japanese research conducted in the aftermath of the Kobe
              earthquake.
