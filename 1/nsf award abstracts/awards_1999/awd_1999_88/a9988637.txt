Abstract    :
              This project addresses two important high-level issues -- reliability and
              performance -- in the development of quality software components that store and
              manipulate persistent data, where that data may be shared and accessed
              concurrently on behalf of principals that may be acting either cooperatively or
              competitively. The objective of the research is to design, implement and
              evaluate techniques that allow application developers to compose the
              competitive concurrency model of traditional database systems, namely
              transactions, with the cooperative concurrency model of traditional programming
              languages - namely, threads -- without sacrificing performance. The resulting
              fusion, so-called transactional threads, encourages development of more
              reliable applications that manipulate large amounts of shared, structured data.
              This project is developing specifications and implementations of integrated
              compiler/run-time and data storage techniques that enable transactional threads
              to perform efficiently. These techniques are being evaluated experimentally
              through execution and measurement of benchmark transactional persistent
              programs. Concrete research products include the development of prototypes of
              transactional threads for persistent extensions of the Modula-3 and Java
              programming languages. The experimental approach to this research offers a rich
              environment for training of experimental computer science students, for further
              experimental research applications, and for development of reliable persistent
              application systems.
