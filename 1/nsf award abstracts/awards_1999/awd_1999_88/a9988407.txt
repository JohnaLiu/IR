Abstract    :
              
   Level of Detail Selection Using a Perceptual Error Metric

This grant
              will investigate the use of visual difference metrics in
level of detail
              calculations.  The research will make it possible to
evaluate the visual
              detectability of changes to an object
representation in addition to the
              geometric difference that such
modifications make to the object's surface
              definition.  Factors that
will be taken into account using a single visual
              metric include
eyepoint position and surface texture.  The context in which
              the
object is placed, including the effect of lighting, will also
              be
evaluated.  The research will explore the impact that each dimension
has
              on the final level of detail and will derive an efficient visual
difference
              metric that can be used in conjunction with existing
geometric measures.
