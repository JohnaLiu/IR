Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Drs. Gregory R. Cook,
              Mukund Sibi and other members of the Chemistry Department at the North Dakota
              State University in establishing and conducting a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002, 36
              undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each conducting summer research
              under the supervision of Chemistry faculty. Participants will take part in a
              professional development program including: seminars by off-campus speakers and
              North Dakota faculty, workshops on scientific writing and graduate study and
              field trips to corporate and government laboratories. Participants will be
              involved in research projects along with graduate students, post-doctoral
              fellows, research staff, other undergraduates and their faculty mentors. In
              partnership with Dakota Technologies, Inc, research internships in a corporate
              lab will also be available to participants. Students will participate in
              biweekly research group meetings as well as present a formal talk and a poster
              on their research. Students will achieve a realistic understanding of the
              demands of independent chemical research and gain self confidence in pursuing
              such studies.
