Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the study of the excitation and ionization of Rydberg
              atoms in strong static and microwave fields.  Experiments will address both the
              hydrogenic and the non-hydrogenic limits of the Rydberg atom system, which has
              unique behavior all its own.  The work will be carried out in an undergraduate
              setting.
