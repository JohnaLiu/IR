Abstract    :
              This project explores practical architectures, circuits, and tool support for
              asynchronous digital systems. In particular, it seeks to fill a design niche
              that requires both high-performance in a specific problem domain and some
              flexibility in how the computation proceeds. One focus is on an asynchronous
              microprogrammed control style called a microengine. In addition to the
              flexibility that comes from a microcoded execution style, the asynchronous
              microengine approach embodies many advantages related directly to the
              asynchronous execution model of the controller, and of the circuits that it
              controls. This project explores the classes of design problems that can benefit
              from asynchronous microengines, explores the use of specialized circuit
              structures to enhance performance, and constructs a tool for the automated
              synthesis of microengines within the ACK high-level synthesis framework.
