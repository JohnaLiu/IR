Abstract    :
              The UnIPhy-REU program will be a collaborative effort of the Nuclear High Energy
              Physics Center and the Research Center for Optical Physics.  Eight
              undergraduate physics students will be recruited each year, with special
              emphasis on students from groups that are under-represented in physics. During
              the eight-week residential program, students will be housed on the campus of
              Hampton University.  They will be engaged in research with a mentor in optical
              physics or in theoretical or experimental nuclear physics. Some students will
              conduct their research on the campus of Hampton University, others at the
              nearby Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.  At the end of the
              program, students will present the results of their research in a 30-minute
              talk and write a research paper to be published in the UnIPhy-REU Proceedings.
