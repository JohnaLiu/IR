Abstract    :
              This project investigates the problem of simultaneous scheduling and HW/SW
              mapping of the computational and communication processes in a generalized task
              flow graph so as to minimize the energy dissipation of the target system while
              satisfying a given deadline. This project also studies a number of problems
              related to power analysis and optimization at the behavioral and RT levels,
              including power modeling and characterization of Intellectual Property cores,
              and automatic clock gating. Finally, the project develops dynamic power
              management algorithms, which save power by shutting down idle devices or
              slowing down underutilized devices, and develops optimal policies for operating
              system (OS) directed power management and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling
              under a variety of system models
