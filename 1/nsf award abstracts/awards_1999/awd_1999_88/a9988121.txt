Abstract    :
              	The Symposium on Inference for Stochastic Processes will be held at the
              University of Georgia from May 10-12, 2000. At the Symposium leading
              researchers in the field will give invited talks on their original research,
              and interact with young researchers and graduate students. Publication of
              selected (refereed) proceedings is planned. Particular efforts will be made to
              include African American, female participants and persons with disabilities.
              The Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) will co-sponsor the Symposium as
              an IMS Special Topics Conference. Moreover, the Symposium is recognized as a
              Satellite meeting of the Fifth World Congress of the Bernoulli Society, and an
              important component of the program will be devoted to Inference Problems in
              Stochastic Geometry. A unique feature of the Symposium will be the small size
              which has been designed for maximum interaction of participants on the very
              significant topic of Inference for Stochastic Processes.
