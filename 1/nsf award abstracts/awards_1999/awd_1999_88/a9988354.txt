Techniques for
              Testing Database Applications

Databases play in important role in almost
              every modern
organization.  Although considerable research effort has been
              devoted
to assuring correctness and efficiency of database
              management
systems, little attention has been paid to assuring the
              correctness
of the application programs that run on these systems.  Failure
              of
database application programs can have severe economic impact,
              so
development of techniques for testing them is of obvious importance.
This
              research project involves development of software testing
techniques targeted
              specifically to database application programs. It
includes development of
              techniques for generating database states
that are useful for testing the
              given application and techniques for
checking the database state after running
              a test. The techniques
studied are partially automated, relying on the user to
              supply some
information and deriving other information automatically. They
              use
the integrity constraints described in the database schema as a
source of
              information to aid in test generation and checking. A
prototype testing tool
              is being developed.  Preliminary evaluations
of the effectiveness and
              usability of the techniques will be
performed with the aid of the tool
              prototype.
