Abstract    :
              William Gelbart of UCLA is supported by the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to investigate theoretically the statistical mechanics of
              colloidal networks and limited-size clusters.  The focus of the research is on
              unusual bulk condensation behavior, and how it is related to structural and
              phase evolution observed in micellized surfactant solutions and colloidal
              suspensions.  Phenomenological theories and Monte Carlo simulations will be
              used to demonstrate the self-assembly of micro-phase-separated domains and
              linear-chain networks.  Connections to model systems will be made in an effort
              to clarify the competition between bulk condensation and other novel
              condensation behaviors.

Apart from the basic statistical mechanics questions
              involved, the control of spatial patterns of particles over nanometer-to-micron
              scales is important for a wide variety of electronic and optical applications. 
              In particular, this research will model experimental phenonema involving
              recently developed metallic nanospheres, which are of potential interest in
              nanoscale technologies.
