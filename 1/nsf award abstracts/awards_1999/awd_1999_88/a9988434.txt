Abstract    :
              The research program entitled "Chemical Reactions of Environmental and
              Atmospheric Relevance on the Surface of Oxide Particles"  will be performed by
              Dr. Vicki Grassian from the University of Iowa and is jointly supported by the
              Atmospheric Chemistry and Analytical and Surface Chemistry Programs.  The goal
              of this project is to study the heterogeneous surface chemistry occurring on
              oxide particles.  Of particular interest is the influence of adsorbed water on
              the adsorption and reaction kinetics of nitric acid, sulfur dioxide and ozone. 
              Spectroscopic and kinetic measurements will be made on these complex systems. 
              

Gas phase reactions occuring in the atmosphere are frequently catalyzed at
              the surface of particulates which exist in suspended aerosols.  In particular,
              the most abundant particulates include the oxides of silicon, aluminum and
              iron.  This research into the fundamental gas phase reactions occuring at the
              surfaces of oxide particles will have direct impact on the understanding of 
              atmospheric processes.  The data obtained will be useful for global atmospheric
              chemistry models and for developing environmental catalysts for the reduction
              of hazardous chemicals.
