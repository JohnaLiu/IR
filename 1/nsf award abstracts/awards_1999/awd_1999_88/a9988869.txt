Abstract    :
              The investigator will conduct research in Number Theory and Arithmetical
              Algebraic Goemetry, with a focus on elliptic curves.  She will study the
              distribution of ranks of elliptic cuves in families of quadratic twists,
              investigating how often a given rank occurs.  Such questions arise when one
              studies the Conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, and conjectures on the
              boundedness or unboundedness of ranks of elliptic curves.

Elliptic curves
              have both mathematical importance, and powerful applications.  They were
              crucial in achieving important and fundamental mathematical results about
              arithmetic and geometry, including Fermat's Last Theorem, the Shimura-Taniyama
              Conjecture, and the Mordell Conjecture.  They can also be used to factor
              integers and to test for primality.  They have important applications to
              cryptography, for use in wireless and/or mobile devices including smart cards,
              cell phones, pagers, and hand-held computers.
