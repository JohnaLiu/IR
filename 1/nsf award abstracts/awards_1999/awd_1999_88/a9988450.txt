Abstract    :
              This project will utilize the large Experiment on Instabilities and Anisotropies
              (LEIA) device at West Virginia University to study the physics of ion
              temperature anisotropy driven instabilities in high beta plasmas.  The primary
              objectives of the study will be (1) to examine the fluctuation spectra ,
              polarizations and thresholds of the relevant instabilities, (2) provide
              detailed analysis of the correlation of the initial temperature anisotropy with
              the resulting wave characteristics, and (3) examine the role of minor heavy ion
              species on the waves.
