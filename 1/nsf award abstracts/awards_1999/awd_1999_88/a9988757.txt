Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to enable a new generation of remote sensors
              for injection molding process monitoring and control. This research is
              motivated by current limitations in observing part quality during manufacture
              that allow the occurrence of defective products and cost inefficiencies.  The
              new sensors will be self-energized by extracting energy from the
              intensification and decay of polymer melt pressure to generate and transmit
              signal pulses that correspond to changes in the molding process.  This approach
              promises to reduce the energy consumption by several orders of magnitude. 
              Issues to be investigated include sensor design, simulation, heat conduction,
              structural integrity, signal encoding, and optimal transmission.  The research
              represents a radical step forward in sensing technology, and has the potential
              to change industrial molding practice by enabling better algorithms for molding
              control.  The potential increase on productivity is estimated to be $200
              million/year.

This research project, being a close collaboration between the
              faculty researchers and their industrial partner at Dynisco Instruments, may
              provide validated process sensing technology for many other applications beyond
              injection molding.  The self-energizing and wireless signal transmission
              concept promises to greatly reduce the information bottleneck out of
              manufacturing processes.  Finally, the research has a great potential to
              fundamentally impact the manufacturing and design curriculum and ultimately,
              the educational infrastructure the researchers' home institution.
