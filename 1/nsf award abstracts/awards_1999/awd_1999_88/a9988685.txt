Abstract    :
              With the advent of fiber-optic networks and integrated optical devices that
              process photons, the future in communications is clearly moving towards the
              optical regime. The central theme of this proposal is to explore ferroelectric
              materials, which possess a built-in spontaneous polarization in their crystal
              structure, as a solid state platform for integrated optical devices. In
              particular, this proposal focuses on ferroelectric lithium niobate (LiNbO3 )
              and lithium tantalate (LiTaO3 ) which have emerged as key materials in
              integrated and nonlinear optics due to their excellent nonlinear optical
              properties and the ability to be grown as large single crystals. The phenomena
              of ferroelectric domains (which are regions of uniform spontaneous
              polarization) and their patterning into diverse shapes by external forces is
              the key to many integrated optics applications. However, the process of domain
              microengineering, remains at best an inexact science even today. This is
              principally due to the lack of a fundamental understanding of domain dynamics
              under external forces that are used to control them.

A comprehensive
              research plan is outlined which encompasses fundamental new studies of
              the
domain phenomenon in ferroelectric materials using real-time optical
              probes, investigation of new techniques for microengineering ferroelectric
              domains, and the application of this knowledge towards the design and
              fabrication of novel electro-optic devices with unprecedented scanning and
              focusing performances integrated on a single ferroelectric chip.
