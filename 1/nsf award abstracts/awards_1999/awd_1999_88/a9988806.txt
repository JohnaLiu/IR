Abstract    :
              Christopher Cummins of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is supported by
               the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research
              in relatively uncharted areas of inorganic chemistry through synthetic and
              mechanistic studies. Specific research topics include: reductive coupling of
              dinitrogen and carbon dioxide; dinitrogen as a co-catalyst for redox reactions;
              dinitrogen cleavage in heterobimetallic systems; reactive intermediates
              via-N-atom transfer; complexed nitrous oxide in oxidation catalysis;
              redox-catalyzed C-N bond cleavage; the terminal carbide functional group;
              chemistry of complexed organoazides; PN complexes; titanium enolates;
              metallaziridine chemistry of molybdenum and niobium; tungsten tris-amide
              complexes; a heptatrienyl ligand.

The research is centered on synthesis and
              characterization of novel types of inorganic substances involving main-group
              elements, such as O, N and P, bound to heavy metals including rhodium,
              tungsten, molybdenum and  niobium. Many of the compounds prepared are expected
              to have novel and interesting patterns of chemical reactivity. Synthetic
              efforts will be supplemented by quantitative and mechanistic studies. The novel
              chemistry being developed is likely to be applicable to practical problems in
              atmospheric, industrial and biological chemistry
