Abstract    :
              This project will study the impact that advanced combinatorial
              algorithm
techniques and data structures can have on the performance
              of
heuristic search, both in theory and in the context of
building a
              general-purpose combinatorial optimization engine.
This engine will be applied
              to yield quality implementations of
heuristics for twenty NP-complete problems
              which arise commonly in practice.
This approach focuses attention on
              identifying versatile high-performance
approaches to local optimization. 
              Further, it suggests a variety of
new lines of theoretical research which will
              lead to improved optimization
algorithms.

The impact of this research
              revolves around (1) the development of new
combinatorial algorithms and data
              structures supporting powerful
crossover, mutation, and cycle-avoidance
              operations, and mapping energy
landscapes, as well as provably good
              approximations, (2) a systematic
study of the performance of local search
              variants including simulated
annealing, genetic algorithms, and tabu search,
              (3) the development of
useful software for research, industrial, and
              educational applications,
and (4) the creation of a new competitive forum for
              assessing the state
of the art in algorithm engineering.
