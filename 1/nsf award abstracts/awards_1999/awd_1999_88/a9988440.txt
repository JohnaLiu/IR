Abstract    :
              The next generation of computing will be dominated by applications which fall
              between the existing categories "real-time" and "general purpose".  These
              "real-rate" applications have performance contraints, such as throughput,
              smoothness, and bounded latency that are looser than real-time but stricter
              than general purpose applications.  This project will further the
              state-of-the-art in resource management for real-rate applications, aiming to
              provide more predictable, accurate, and dynamic resource allocation.  In
              particular, it will develop mechanisms and policies that can manage resources
              accurately for variable rate, high performance applications such as video
              streaming, sensor networks, or routers.  It will also develop modeling and
              analysis techniques based on control theory that support reasoning about the
              dynamic behavior of applications and computer systems.  Activities included in
              the project include: evaluating control algorithms for suitability for
              different application classes, inventing implementation techniques for building
              low overhead highly accurate controllers, developing techniques to analyze
              complex systems composed of multiple adaptive applications and resource
              managers, and defining notions such as quality-of-service or correctness that
              incorporate dynamics.
