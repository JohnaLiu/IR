Abstract    :
              The objective of this project, directed by Dr. Neal Evans of the University of
              Texas, is an improved understanding of how stars form. The primary method used
              will be to confront the relatively well-developed theories about low-mass star
              formation with observations that test those theories and distinguish between
              different theoretical ideas. The resulting improved understanding of low-mass
              star formation will provide the basis for research on the formation of
              high-mass stars. 

Two methods will be emphasized in this research.  First,
              computer programs will be used to translate the results of theoretical
              calculations into observable quantities, such as line profiles of different
              molecular transitions.  Second, extensive observations of molecular spectral
              lines will be obtained for comparison with the model calculations.  The
              observational work will be centered at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory
              (CSO).   Other telescopes will be used to supplement the data obtained at the
              CSO.  In addition to improving our understanding of how stars form, this
              project will provide the educational focus for a graduate student.  The
              experience gained by students in working with instruments, computers, and
              numerical modeling adds to the scientific and technical base of the country.
