Ricketts
This award to University of Minnesota at Duluth will provide
              instrumentation for lake research for use on R/V Blue Heron, a research vessel
              operated by the University's Large Lakes Observatory as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              instrumentation to be acquired includes a portable winch and two computers. 
              The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists
              conduct studies in the Great Lakes during 2000 and future years.
