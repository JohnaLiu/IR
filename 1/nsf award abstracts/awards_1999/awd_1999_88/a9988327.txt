Abstract    :
              As real-time computer application systems become larger and more complex, it is
              becoming imperative that such applications be implemented on multi-processor
              platforms rather than on uniprocessor ones.  Furthermore it is often the case
              that the implementation platforms are not completely homogeneous, but are
              comprised of several different kinds of processors and other resources.  This
              project will different kinds of processors and other resources.  This project
              will study both the fundamental scheduling-theoretic questions, and the
              pragmatic implementation issues, that arise when periodic task systems are to
              be implemented on such heterogeneous multi-resource platforms.  This research
              will build upon previous research, performed by both investigators, on fair
              scheduling in real-time system.  The theoretical findings resulting from this
              research will be validated by applying them to some implementation projects
              currently under development at the University of North Carolina.
