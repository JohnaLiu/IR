	While studying mean field models for spin glasses (such as
              the famous Sherrington Kirkpatrick model) a number of physicists "discovered"
              (or more accurately, conjectured) some completely new phenomenon of probability
              theory, namely the existence of intricate structures among the near extreme
              values of large families of correlated random variables. The main goal of this
              research is, through the study of the main models, to provide mathematically
              rigorous foundations for their conjectures. Two main objectives are the control
              of the entire high temperature region for the main models, and a complete
              description of the low temperature phase of the simplest models.
	One of the
              central themes of probability theory is the emergence of a kind of order out of
              large number of random events. This is expressed by the main classical
              theorems, starting with the law of large numbers. These classical result relate
              to situations where the events are independent, that is do not influence each
              other. Such an assumption is unrealistic in practice. We investigate the
              emergence of new types of collective behavior in large collections of random
              events, where each event can, and will, influence all the others.
