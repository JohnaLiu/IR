This research will investigate actions of Lie groups and
              related questions
of dynamics, topology, and geometry.  A focus will be on the
              actions of
non-compact semisimple Lie groups on manifolds, and the
              relationship
between the group, geometric structures invariant under the
              action, and the
topology of the manifold, in particular the fundamental group.
               Use of
ergodic theory, i.e., the measure theoretic structure and behavior of
              group
actions, will be extensive.  In particular, the structure of
              stationary
measures and invariant measures for these actions, and the extent
              to which
such general measures are similar to standard arithmetic or
              projective
models, will play a major role.

The study of symmetry has played
              a major role in science and mathematics,
and is a fundamental, often
              indispensable, tool for understanding many
phenomena.  The connections to
              science and technology span the gamut from
elementary particle physics, to
              crystal structure of materials, to network
design, to dynamical systems.  The
              underlying mathematics for studying
symmetry is group theory.  This research
              will focus on fundamental
mathematical questions concerning large symmetry
              groups, i.e. situations in
which the structure under consideration has many
              symmetries.  It is
anticipated that this work will contribute to the fabric of
              fundamental
understanding of symmetry, thereby increasing the power of its
              potential
application across science.
