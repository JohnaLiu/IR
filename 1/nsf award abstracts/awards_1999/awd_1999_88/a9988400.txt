Special Project: Workshop
              on Undergraduate Education & Computer Vision

This project provides support
              for up to 25 faculty from primarily undergraduate teaching institutions,
              particularly those that serve traditionally under-represented groups, to attend
              the IEEE sponsored Workshop on Undergraduate Education and Computer Vision,
              held in conjunction with the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
              2000 Conference.  Growth of the field of image-related computation, including
              especially computer vision and pattern recognition, has created a significant
              need for additional educational opportunities in these areas and this project
              provides a highly leveraged approach toward meeting a part of that need.  The
              workshop provides well-documented examples of courses, course modules, case
              studies, laboratory resources and other teaching materials to help faculty
              design high-quality image-related undergraduate courses.  This project is a
              follow-on to the successful similar workshop held in 1997.
