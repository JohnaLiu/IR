Abstract    :
              Algorithms and Experimentation in Computational Geometry

The project mixes
              central theoretical investigations in 
geometric computing together with
              experimentation with geometric codes.
A major part of the effort will be
              devoted
to problems of multi-scale representation and simplification
of
              shapes in 3D, with applications to computer graphics
and virtual reality,
              sampling and optimization, algorithm animation and 
visualization. On the
              theoretical side, it is anticipated that the work
will draw mostly from
              complexity theory, discrepancy theory, and 
algorithm design, while the
              experimental aspect will emphasize
software building using available geometric
              codes and
animation tools
