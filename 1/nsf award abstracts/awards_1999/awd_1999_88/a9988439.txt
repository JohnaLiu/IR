Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to prepare and characterize a set of novel
              electrooptic materials based on monomeric units that are homeomorphically
              related to compasses and gyroscopes.  The desired molecular architectures have
              a structurally shielded dipole that is free to reorient along a given axis
              under the influence of external electric and/or magnetic fields.  Materials
              built with molecular compasses and gyroscope will be based on 1,
              4-bis-[3-(9-triptycyl) propynyl]-benzenes and 1,4-bus-triarylpropynyl benzenes.
               These materials are expected to have properties related to those of molecular
              crystals, plastic crystals and liquid crystals.  The materials will be analyzed
              in detail by X-ray crystallography, solid state NMR, thermal analysis,
              polarizing microscopy, and dielectric spectroscopy.

The recent availability
              of intense light sources and recent progress in the areas of materials design
              and electrooptical phenomena have led to the rapid development of photonics as
              the most promising technology for the acquisition, storage, transfer and
              processing of information.  While permanent dipolar orientation is desirable
              for non-linear optical photonics applications, there is also a need for
              macroscopic systems such as liquid crystals which respond to external fields
              within very short time-scales.
