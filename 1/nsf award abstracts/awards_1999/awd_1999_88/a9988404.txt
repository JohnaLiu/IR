Abstract    :
              This work develops a framework for the replication of heterogeneous multimedia
              data for achieving high availability while maintaining low access cost.  The
              framework encompasses various aspects of replication in distributed systems:
              users and policy, networks, and servers.  The research develops the technical
              concept of quality quorum systems to enable efficient and robust multimedia
              replication.  The results of the research is brought together in a
              Heterogeneous Multimedia Object Replication (HUMOR) system.  The work has a
              significant impact on distributed server architecture design, multimedia
              databases, digital libraries, and distant learning environments.
