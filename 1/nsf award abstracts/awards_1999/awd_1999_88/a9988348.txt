ABSTRACT 

Parametric problems are those whose input
              depends continuously on one or
more values.  This award supports work in two
              fundamental areas in
parametric optimization.  The first is fixed-dimensional
              optimization,
with special emphasis on problems whose objective function can
              be
efficiently evaluated at any point by a well-behaved algorithm.
              Problems
of this sort arise, for example, in Lagrangian relaxation. The
              main
question is to determine the conditions under which evaluation is as
              easy
as global optimization, within the context of Megiddo's method
              of
parametric search.  The second area to be investigated is the
              construction
of parameter space decompositions yielding optimal solutions for
              all
parameter values.  One issue is obtaining bounds on the number of
              regions
of the decomposition.  This will be studied in part within a
              framework
that captures the essence of problems as diverse as stable marriage
              and
evolutionary tree construction.  Another question is whether one
              can
accelerate the construction of the decomposition by exploiting
              structural
similarities between adjacent regions.
