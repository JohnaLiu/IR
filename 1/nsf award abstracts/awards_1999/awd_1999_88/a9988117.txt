Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks partial funding for an international conference on the topic
              of organic nonlinear optics with meeting headquarters at Davos, Switzerland. 
              Travel funds are requested to support U.S. speakers and students.  The strategy
              we will use to get students to attend is to offer bundled support to an
              academic speaker and one of their students.  The purpose of the meeting is to
              bring together top researchers - whose expertise spans material design,
              material characterization, device fabrication, and integrated device
              architectures - to the captive setting of a small town to discuss and assess
              progress in the field.  This upcoming conference is motivated by 5 previous
              NSF-supported conferences that were held in Pullman, Washington in the summer
              of 1992; in Val Thorens, France in the winter of 1994 (ICONO'1); in Kusatsu,
              Japan in the summer of 1995 (ICONO'4).  This proposed meeting would be the
              sixth in the series of meetings that are held every 18 months.  The demand for
              such a meeting was evidenced by full-capacity attendance at ICONO'1, ICONO'2,
              ICONO'3, and ICONO'4.  The strategy is to hold this meeting in those countries
              that are active in organic nonlinear optics.  At the ICONO'1 meeting, U.S. and
              other non-European attendees had the opportunity to learn about a large array
              of European research activities that are normally not represented at U.S.
              conferences.  Similarly, at ICONO'2, Pacific Rim research was show-cased. 
              ICONO'3, while held in the United States, was attended by a majority of foreign
              scientists.  ICONO'4 gave U.S. participants a first-hand view of a new
              university that was built in photonics valley in Japan.  NSF-supported students
              attended all four conferences.  The aim of this meeting is to bring together
              this group of internationally distinguished researches to a forum of Europe
              that encourages discussion and interactions.  This will also give U.S.
              scientists an opportunity to assess foreign efforts in the fast-growing area of
              Photonics.
