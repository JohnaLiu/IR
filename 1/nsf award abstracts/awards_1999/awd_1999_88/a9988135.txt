This award to University of California at San Diego will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use by the Oceanographic Data
              Facility of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, as well as specific
              instruments for use on the four research vessels operated by the institution,
              R/Vs Revelle, Melville, New Horizon and Sproul.  All four of these research
              vessels are operated by the university as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes two 24-position "carousel" sampling systems for use with the
              conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) system, spare parts for the nutrient
              analyzer system, an acoustic "pinger" for locating instruments underwater, new
              sensors for the underway environmental data system, computer peripherals for
              shipboard use, and echosounder transducers for measuring water depth. Funds are
              also provided to assist in acquisition of a new multibeam echosounder system
              for R/V Revelle; funds are also being provided for this purpose by the DURIP
              program (Department of Defense) and by non-federal funds from Scripps
              Institution.  The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist marine
              scientists conduct studies worldwide on SIO and other research vessels during
              2000 and future years.
