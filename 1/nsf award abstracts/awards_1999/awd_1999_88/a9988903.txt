Abstract    :
              The liquefaction of loose, saturated, cohesionless soils due to earthquake
              loading has been studied extensively over the past 35 years, resulting in both
              laboratory and empirically based procedures to evaluate liquefaction potential.
               Kayen and Mitchell (1997) proposed an earthquake-based approach based on Arias
              intensity to assess liquefaction potential that has proven to be highly
              reliable.  (The Arias intensity indirectly accounts for both magnitude and
              duration of an earthquake motion.)  We propose to evaluate the applicability of
              the Kayen and Mitchell (1997) method for liquefaction evaluation to other
              (non-seismic) types of loading.  

The source of the load is the implosion of
              the Kingdome in downtown Seattle, which took place on March 26, 2000.  The
              Kingdome foundation soils consist of potentially liquefiable fill and alluvial
              sediments; however, before the implosion there was no established procedure to
              evaluate whether the soils would liquefy due to the impact produced by the
              falling structure.

Shannon & Wilson installed an array of downhole and
              surface instruments to measure ground motion and pore pressure generated by the
              falling pieces of concrete.  This sort of impact load is analogous to loads
              produced by deep-dynamic compaction, a commonly used soil improvement method. 
              We propose to analyze the data collected by Shannon & Wilson during the
              Kingdome implosion to assess the usefulness of applying earthquake-based
              liquefaction concepts to liquefaction induced by conventional demolition/site
              improvement techniques
