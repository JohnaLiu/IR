Abstract    :
              Franklin Schutz of Indiana University Purdue University at Indianapolis is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              for research designed to understnd the consequences of inner coordination-shell
              structural changes on rates of electron-transfer reactions, through study of
              electrochemical activation parameters for reactions involving
              carefully-selected families of transition metal compounds. Aspects that will be
              of particular interest are: a) contributions of inner-shell rearrangements to
              the entropic component of the driving force of electron transfer; b) the
              influence of spin-changes on rates of electron transfer; c) multielectron
              transfer in ligand-bridged binuclear complexes as influenced by structure of
              the inner coordination spheres involved.

The class of reactions that are
              being studied in this program is of critical importance in many types chemical
              reaction systems that are of high practical importance -- industrial catalysis,
              biological respiration, functioning of neural circuits, for instance. Although
              great progress has been made in the past several decades in understanding these
              processes, many fundamental questions remain unanswered, in part because of the
              difficulty of sorting out the many subtle chemical influences that bear on the
              rates of electron-transfer processes. In this program, highly sophisticated
              electrochemical and chemical techniques will be used to isolate and investigate
              several of the most pressing of these questions. Success in this effort may be
              expected to yield dividends in many scientific areas.
