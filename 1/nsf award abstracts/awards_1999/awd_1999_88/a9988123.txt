Abstract    :
              This project focuses on studying plasma formation and material damage produced
              by nonlinear absorption of laser pulses in transparent materials.  By tightly
              focusing ultrashort laser pulses, preliminary evidence of material damage with
              as little as five nanoJoule of laser energy has been observed.  Because of the
              low pulse energy and tight focusing used in the experiments, intensities
              producing permanent damage can be achieved with minimal self-focusing, allowing
              the field intensity at the focus to be accurately determined.  Measuring the
              threshold intensity for various laser and material parameters affords the group
              an opportunity to identify the relative role of multiphoton, tunneling, and
              avalanche ionization processes in femtosecond laser interactions with bulk
              media.  In addition, detailed studies of the damage morphology for different
              laser parameters will uncover the basic damage mechanisms at work and provide
              useful information for applications.
