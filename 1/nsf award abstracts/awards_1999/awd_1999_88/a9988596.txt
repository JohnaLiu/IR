This award to San Jose State University will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Point Sur, a research
              vessel operated by the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              instrumentation to be acquired for shipboard use includes slip rings, thermal
              chart recorder, wireless local area network for connecting the ship to
              laboratory computer system, solar radiation sensor, dissolved oxygen sensor,
              PAR sensor and LCD monitor. The shared-use instrumentation supported here will
              assist marine scientists conduct studies, particularly along the California
              coast, during 2000 and future years.
