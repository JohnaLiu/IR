Abstract    :
              Irving Epstein and Anatol Zhabotinsky of Brandeis University are supported by
              the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to pursue research on
              nonlinear chemical dynamics, specifically experimental and computational
              investigations of pattern-formation in reaction-diffusion systems.  Light will
              be used to produce new types of patterns.  A rarely studied bifurcation (the
              short-wave instability) will be studied under global negative feedback, and
              forced and unforced chaotic and multiperiodic chemical oscillators will be
              investigated.  Pattern formation in nonuniform media, and in a new
              hypophosphite-containing chemical system, will be explored.

Pattern
              formation in chemistry is a central problem in modern macroscopic chemical
              kinetics.  Reaction-diffusion systems constitute the most convenient analog
              models for pattern formation in neurobiology, catalysis, and ecology.  These
              phenomena involve global feedback and/or the propagation of chemical waves
              through nonuniform media.
