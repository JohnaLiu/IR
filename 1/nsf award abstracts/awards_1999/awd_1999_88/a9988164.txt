Abstract    :
              Clusters are becoming a predominant and cost-effective platform
for high
              performance parallel computing. These systems are gaining acceptance
not just
              for scientific applications, which have traditionally needed
supercomputers,
              but are also being deployed to meet the needs of
applications in domains such
              as databases, web service, multimedia, and 
graphics/visualization.
              Traditional parallel scheduling techniques
such as simple space sharing or
              coscheduling, which are optimized more
for throughput, may not be able to
              handle the responsiveness needs of
these emerging applications. At the same
              time, leaving it entirely
to the native operating system scheduler at each
              node to make independent
decisions can have a detrimental effect on the
              performance of communicating
applications. Considering these different issues,
              this proposal will
explore techniques for efficient management and
              coordination of the 
CPU resources across the nodes of a cluster. This
              research will develop
a framework to design cluster scheduling mechanisms
              taking communication 
into account together with working sets and I/O
              information, accomodate
the constraints and idiosyncrasies of an application,
              and adapt dynamically
to the system load. The mechanisms will be evaluated
              with real workloads,
using simulation, analytical models and actual
              implementations.
The outcome of this research will take an important step
              towards making
clusters more ubiquitous, multiprogrammed, manageable and
              user-friendly.
