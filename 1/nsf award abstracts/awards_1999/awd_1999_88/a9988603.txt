It is proposed to
              expand an experimental facility dedicated to liquid metal fluid mechanics and
              solidification research: its existing density (i.e. phase) field visualization
              capability will be supplemented by a new particle tracking velocimetry
              technique: in this manner, the two-phase convective processes which
              characterize the transition from liquid melts to solid alloy casts, will be
              quantitatively measurable in a number of cases.  This new experimental facility
              will then be available for validation to the theoreticians who have accumulated
              a large number of numerical simulations, but so far without the availability of
              such a reality check.  The PI is contemplating his own set of comparisons:
              single element melts (Gallium) with and without solidification, Gallium-Indium
              and Aluminum alloys with solidification.  More broadly, the PI envisions a
              multi-University activity which would answer the need of the liquid metal basic
              research community in the US and abroad.  The PI gave an extensive evaluation
              of the specific challenges associated with the new technique, especially in
              regard to the choice of tracer particulates.
