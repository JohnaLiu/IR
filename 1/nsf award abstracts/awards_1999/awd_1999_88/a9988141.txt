Abstract    :
              In order to make programming easier, future software development environments
              will have to raise the level of abstraction at which programmers work, provide
              them with more and better information about their systems, and handle more of
              the mundane and mechanical tasks involved in programming. This project is
              designed to lay the foundations for the next-generation programming tools that
              will compose such environments. In particular, the project will consider two
              important tools: one to support design patterns, and another to visualize
              software behavior. The design patterns tool will let programmers find, create,
              verify, and edit instances of design patterns in their source code, thus
              allowing higher-level programming. The software visualizations will enable
              programmers to quickly define and see visualizations for specific problems that
              arise in program execution, thus allowing better understanding of the running
              program.
