Abstract    :
              In bulk power transmission systems, the use of power electronics based devices
              can potentially overcome limitations of the present mechanically controlled
              transmission system.  They can help delay or minimize the need to build more
              transmission lines and enable neighboring utilities and regions to economically
              and reliably exchange power.  The existing Flexible AC Transmission System
              (FACTS) technologies have limited impact on active power flow related system
              performance.  Integrating an energy storage system (ESS), such as battery
              energy storage, superconducting magnetic energy storage, flywheel energy
              storage, or super capacitor energy storage, into a FACTS device can provide
              dynamic decentralized active power capabilities and much needed flexibility for
              mitigating transmission level power flow problems.

This work will focus on
              power electronics and control topologies design for FACTS/ESS integration. 
              Existing power electronics and control topologies will be researched. 
              Innovative design will be proposed for integrating flexible AC transmission
              systems (FACTS) and energy storage systems (ESS) devices.  The proposed project
              will be conducted between a partnership program composed of two universities,
              Virginia Tech and UM-Rolla, along with BWX Technologies, Inc. and Sandia
              National Laboratory.

The integration of energy storage with power
              electronics devices has many other applications in different scales including
              aircraft carrier and naval shipboard, electric and hybrid-electric vehicles,
              electrically sensitive manufacturing and remote energy usage such as weather
              research stations, island systems, and military applications such as ground
              based defense systems.
