ABSTRACT   Berkowitz   Proposal  DBI- 9988029

The Institute of
              Ecosystem Studies' Research Experiences for Undergraduates (IES-REU) program
              immerses students in a highly interactive, research oriented environment, and
              fosters an understanding of the contexts along with the practices of ecological
              research.  Anticipated outcomes are: (1) Students develop excellent science
              process skills. (2) Students acquire broad perspectives on ecology in the
              context of both science and society to address real-world problems. (3)
              Students develop a strong background in several branches of ecology. (4)
              Students are better equipped to choose and pursue a career in ecology. (5) The
              program contributes to the field of ecology by providing quality training for a
              diverse group of students. (6) We disseminate a well documented and evaluated
              model for student training.  The 114 participants in our 1988-1999 programs
              included 32% minorities and 66 % women; over 86 % of those who have graduated
              currently are in graduate school or are working in science.  The 2000-2002
              program builds on the strengths of our past program and will bring 10 students
              to IES for a twelve-week program each summer, 8 with NSF funds and 2 with funds
              from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  The program has three components:
              (1)Student Research Projects - working closely with a mentor scientist, each
              student delineates a research question and associated hypotheses, develops and
              implements the project, analyzes data, gives an oral presentation in a formal
              Research Symposium and writes a paper for an IES Occasional Publication. (2)
              Research Strategies for the undergraduate - workshops give explicit training in
              the tools essential for research and foster student reflection. (3) Research in
              Context - discussions, case studies, and seminars broaden students'
              perspectives on the various contexts and applications of science, including a
              full-day Forum on Opportunities in Ecology that exposes students to a broad
              range of careers in science and applications of ecology in the modern world.
