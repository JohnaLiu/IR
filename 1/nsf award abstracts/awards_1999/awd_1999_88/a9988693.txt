Abstract    :
              9988693
An environmental chamber for stress-assisted in vitro engineering of
              skin tissue will be built. Three dimensional natural collagen scaffolds will be
              immersed in a continuously replenished nutrient and seeded with fibroblast
              cells. This will be subjected to a sinusoidal loading at constant maximum load
              for at least 20 weeks. A similar collagen scaffold assay will be immersed in
              the same environment but not subjected to cyclic loads and deformations. The
              samples will be monitored periodically during growth to determine the effects
              of stress assistance on collagen density, anisotropy collagen moduli,
              fibroblast phenotype and fiber number density. The biomicromechanical
              constitutive modeling of collagen growth and remodeling will be pursues. The
              various known and speculated mechanisms driving collagen remodeling to HTS
              formation will be incorporated into the model as discussed. An anisotropic
              continuum model of collagen growth will be built using the experimental results
              to characterize the evolving network stiffness and anisotropy in relation to
              collagen growth.
