Abstract    :
              This project is the continuation of a heretofore successful effort to produce
              and trap cold molecules.  The first part of the project will examine several
              methods, among them photoassociation and three-body recombination, to increase
              the production rate of trapped cesium dimers.   Photoassociation with two
              lasers will be used to produce specific molecules in specific electronic and
              ro-vibrational states.  The second part of the project will use the trapped
              species to investigate cold collisions and to study laser cooling of the
              internal degrees of freedom.  Eventually, the production of trimers and large
              clusters will be attempted.
