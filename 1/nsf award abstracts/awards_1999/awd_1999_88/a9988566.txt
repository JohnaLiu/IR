	An electron was the first elementary particle known to
              physisists.  The charge of an electron was discoverd in 1897 and the spin in
              1925.  The project is devoted to a study of a separation between charge and
              spin of the electron in strongly correlated systems.  The Hubbard model was
              suggested in 1966 to describe strong interaction of electrons in solids.  The
              project suggests to study charge and spin separation of the electron by means
              of exact analitical solution of the Hubbard model.
