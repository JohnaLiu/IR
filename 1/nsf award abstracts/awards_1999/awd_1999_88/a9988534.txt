Abstract    :
              9988534
Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is a mature technology. The toughness
              of AAC can be improved by growing a reinforced phase in situ during the
              processing of the AAC. Minor changes in chemistry and processing and provide
              major changes in microstructure and the resulting physical and mechanical
              properties of AAC. For example, it has been found that partial replacement of
              CaO by NaOH and partial replacement of quartz by class F fly ash will lead to
              the formation of a second phase during the autoclaving process. Rather than
              forming relatively large hydrogenate crystals, which would happen if fly ash
              were substituted for quartz, the excess alumna in the fly ash can now combine
              with the sodium hydroxide to form network-structured materials such as
              crystalline feldspathoifds and zeolites (tectosilicates). Because these phases
              form during the autoclaving process, they will be in equilibrium with and
              randomly dispersed among the tobermorite crystals that normally form in AAC.
              Typically, the tectosilicates are 10-20 micrometers in size. The presence of
              second phases approximately the same size, as the tobermorite should increase
              toughness via crack blocking rather than crack bridging. Once this concept is
              experimentally verified and one is able to demonstrate that composite AAC has
              superior properties vis-a-vis concrete block, the prospect that AAC could
              become an integral part of the North American construction process will greatly
              improve. As North America develops more stringent energy and conservation
              requirements driven by a growing environmental conscience, AAC building
              materials could well become the building material of choice for the 21st
              Century.
