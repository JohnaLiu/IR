Abstract    :
              The University of California at Irvine will conduct a physics Research
              Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, offering each year for three years
              a ten week long summer program providing research opportunity for twelve
              students .  The program involves projects with a variety of physics research
              groups under close supervision by faculty and senior research staff.  Research
              opportunities are offered in the areas of experimental elementary particle
              physics, condensed matter, plasma physics, astrophysics and nonlinear dynamics.
               Close contact between student participants, to encourage  sharing of research
              experiences in these varied areas, is promoted through shared housing and
              social activities.   The research experience is further enhanced by a seminar
              series, visits to the labs of fellow participants, and excursions to other
              research labs in the San Diego and Los Angeles area.   At the conclusion of
              their project, each participant writes a paper on his/her work which appears in
              an annual compendium of  student research papers distributed to all
              participants.
