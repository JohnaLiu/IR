Abstract    :
              Dr. Bortoletto seeks partial support for carrying out a workshop on the subject
              of detectors for studying the point of collisions in high-energy particles. 
              This workshop is vital to the work being done in the U.S. in preparation for
              the Large Hadron Collider experiments.
