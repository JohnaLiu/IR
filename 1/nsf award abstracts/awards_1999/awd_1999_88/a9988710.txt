              ABSTRACT for Alperin's Proposal 9988710

There are many deep conjectures in
              the representation theory of finite groups but one of them, Broue's conjecture,
              has now garnered a great deal of attention, for a number of reasons.  First, it
              implies new results about characters, the main question is about structure of
              algebras and derived categories and there are many connections with the
              representation theory of groups of Lie type and other parts of mathematics. 
              The principal investigator is studying this conjecture and related questions
              from six different points of view, including proofs of special but significant
              case, and possible generalizations which would shed light on the ideas needed
              for a complete solution.  He is also working on a few other questions in
              modular representation theory, one motivated by some work in algebraic
              topology.

Group theory is an old subject in mathematics, its roots in
              algebra but with applications all over mathematics and science. One of the
              central topics is the representation theory of groups which studies the most
              common way the subject arises in other areas.  The investigator is working on
              some of the key open problems.  The particular topics are ones that do have
              points of contact in cryptography for example, in so-called group codes, even
              though the work is seeking general new results rather than current
              applications.
