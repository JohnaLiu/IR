Abstract    :
              Five study questions will guide the activities of the research team:
1 - to
              what extent can the student assessment data be appropriately linked across
              reform sites?
2 - What types of linking strategies are appropriate in which of
              the sites to improve the comparability of reform outcomes?
3 - How can
              information on the process drivers, saturation and alignment be combined across
              sites to support meaningful inferences?
4 - Given the data already available
              in the data sets and the data to be gathered from the sites, what statistical
              methods can support inferences about "causality" from the sites, what
              statistical methods can support inferences about "casuality" from covariation
              among reform activities and swubsequent student assessment results?
5 - How
              should future reform efforts be structured and reported to facilitate improved
              inferences both within and across reform sites?
