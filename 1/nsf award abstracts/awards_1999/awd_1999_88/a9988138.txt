Abstract    :
              Professor Robin Hochstrasser of the University of Pennsylvania is funded by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experiments on liquid phase
              chemical dynamics.  This proposal represents the systematic development of
              two-dimensional time-resolved infrared spectroscopies, which Professor
              Hochstrasser has pioneered.  These methods, which have analogs in the microwave
              region using NMR, can yield highly detailed information about molecular
              vibrational dynamics and coupling and the structures of the liquid samples
              themselves. Two dimensional IR studies on polypeptides are aimed at improving
              our understanding of the structure and dynamics of proteins.  Other
              multidimensional laser experiments are aimed at gaining new insights into the
              structure and dynamics of liquids, including neat water, and polymers. 
              


The work on two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy is extremely timely in
              addressing the need for new methods to provide breakthroughs in determining
              protein, polymer and liquid structures.  Instead of the traditional way of
              thinking about molecules as discrete particles in solution, this work
              introduces a new paradigm -- molecules are considered as extended networks of
              coupled vibrators.  Accurate pictures of liquid structures provide some of the
              key information necessary for addressing biomolecular and environmental
              problems.
