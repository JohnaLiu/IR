The University of Southern Mississippi (USM) provides
              opportunities for undergraduate research through a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The REU Site is hosted by the Department of Polymer
              Science at the University.  Ten students are recruited nationwide every year
              for a ten-week summer research experience, with a recruitment focus on students
              from undergraduate institutions.  The REU Site participants include science
              education majors, or pre-service teachers, and science majors whose goal is to
              teach, as well as participation of faculty from the students' home institutions
              through development of research collaborations with the USM faculty.

The
              program at USM provides non-USM undergraduates an opportunity to learn how to
              do polymer research by actually doing it under the supervision of the USM
              faculty.   It also provides an opportunity for enhancing undergraduate research
              at small colleges and universities by training faculty there who work with
              students in the USM REU program and extend the research projects developed with
              USM faculty to involve other students
