The Northern Proper Motion (NPM) program is nearing
              completion after a half century of work.  First-epoch photography began in
              1947; second-epoch photography was completed in 1988.  Measurements and
              reductions for proper motions, positions, and photometry in the sky outside the
              Milky Way (Part I of the NPM program) began in 1975 and were completed in 1992.
               The Lick NPM1 Catalog, containing 149,000 stars, was presented to the user
              community in 1993.  Work on Part II of the NPM program, with some 300,000 stars
              in the Milky Way sky, began in 1996, and plate measurements were completed in
              1999.  This award will support data reduction and star identifications for the
              final three years of NPM2.  The NPM program will be completed with the
              publication of the Lick NPM2 Catalog in 2003.

The NPM1 and NPM2 catalogs
              will have lasting value as a unique database for many future studies in
              galactic structure, stellar kinematics, and astrometry.  This award is made
              through the Galactic Astronomy Program in the Division of Astronomical
              Sciences.
