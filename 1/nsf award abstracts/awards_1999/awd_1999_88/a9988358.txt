Abstract    :
              Vogt, Steven
"A Survey of Nearby Stars for Extrasolar
              Planets"
AST-9988358

Dr. Vogt is continuing a very successful search for
              giant planets around nearby stars (exoplanets).  Approximately 1000
              main-sequence stars are being monitored for small velocity variations (~2-3
              m/sec) imposed by the gravitational perturbations by planetary companions.  The
              exoplanet survey is being conducted primarily with the HIRES spectrometer on
              the Keck I telescope, supplemented by observations conducted at Lick
              Observatory.  Over the duration of the project, ~12 years, it will be possible
              to detect Jupiter and Saturn analogs beyond five times the Earth's distance
              from the Sun.  The main goals of the project include:  (1) Is our solar system
              typical or unique?  (2) What are the frequency and physical characteristics of
              exoplanets?  (3)  Are distant giant planets in nearly circular orbits a
              prerequisite for the existence of terrestrial planets in the habitable
              zone?
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Stellar
              Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
