Abstract    :
              Absract for Benson's NSF Proposal 9988110

Professor Benson's research centers
              around group representation theory and its connections with cohomology.  In
              recent years, infinite dimensional representations of finite groups have played
              an increasingly important role, especially because of the idempotent modules of
              Rickard.  Benson proposes to work on the role of the nucleus for nonprincipal
              blocks, pure injectivity and phantom maps, and their connections with
              Grothendieck's local duality, and infinitely generated endotrivial modules in
              this context. He also proposes to work with Greenlees on duality spectral
              sequences for p-adic analytic groups with torsion, and with Carlson on
              calculating cohomology of some specific finite groups, as well as continuing
              his investigation of 2-completions of classifying spaces as homotopy
              colimits.

Representation theory, in the context of this proposal, means the
              representations of abstract groups as groups of matrices.  Cohomology measures
              how these matrices can be patched together, as well as other more subtle
              properties of the matrix representations.  Progress in this area has
              implications in algebra, topology, geometry and number theory.  Recent
              developments using infinite dimensional representations have had a great impact
              on our understanding of the finite dimensional ones.  Benson's research
              involves theoretical and computational aspects of finite and infinite
              dimensional representations and their cohomology, making use of recent progress
              to push forward our understanding of these and related areas.
