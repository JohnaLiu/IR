Abstract    :
              With this award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its
              support for the work of Dr. Eric V. Anslyn in the Department of Chemistry at
              the University of Texas at Austin.   The work aims to prepare artificial
              phosphoesterase enzymes capable of cleaving RNA with rates and selectivities
              rivaling those of the natural enzymes.   The approach involves systematic
              structural variations around a rigid hexasubstituted benzene core with attached
              electrophilic Zn(+2) and guanidinium cation sites.   Cooperativity between
              metal ion sites and between metal ions and guanidinium will be investigated
              using kinetics, measurements of equilibrium binding constants, pH titrations,
              and crystallography.

Artificial enzymes which can cleave DNA will be
              developed by making small tight cavities in which DNA can form at least four
              and as many as six hydrogen bonds to positively charged zinc or guanidinium
              ions.   The keys to these new catalysts are the large number of potential
              binding interactions and the rigidity of the cavity walls.   If effective
              catalysts can be developed they would be useful in gene therapy.   The PI has a
              record of being an excellent teacher and research mentor, and has helped a
              number of female graduate students to go on to get PhDs.
