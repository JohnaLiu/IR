Design Support for State-Based Distributed Object Software

Computer
              system applications are rapidly becoming
more decentralized and concurrent,
              especially for
important environments like military command and
              control,
commercial telecommunications, and evolving Internet
applications.
              Complexity in specification, design, and analysis
dramatically increases in
              software architectures defined
by distributed components interacting via
              non-deterministic
communication patterns. One of the most significant
              research
problems is achieving a balance between general theoretical
concepts
              and specific practical techniques. This research
investigates a
              domain-specific design technique for
distributed-object software systems. The
              approach is based on
applying and adapting Petri nets, an existing graph
              model
oriented toward concurrent systems. The specific objectives
are to
              solidify the theoretical foundations for a
state-based object design notation
              and investigate
capabilities for inheritance modeling within the
              design
framework. This research can lead to methods and notations
              that
support engineering-oriented design of complex distributed
software
              systems. This has the potential to improve the overall
quality and
              cost-effectiveness of development and maintenance
for a wide range of critical
              software applications.
