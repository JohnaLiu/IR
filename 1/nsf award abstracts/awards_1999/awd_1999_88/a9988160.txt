A. Project Summary
An important goal in parallel processing is the
              development of general-
purpose parallel models and algorithms. The challenge
              here has been to find
the right balance between simplicity, accuracy and broad
              applicability. This
project will develop a comprehensive collection of
              parallel algorithms suitable
for practical use by working with three
              general-purpose parallel computation
models that have been proposed over the
              last decade | Bulk-Synchronous
Parallel (BSP), LogP, and Queuing Shared-Memory
              (QSM) models | as
well as with the external memory Parallel Disk Model (PDM).
              Some uni-
fying themes for the design of efficient algorithms on these models
              will be
developed, and these will form the basis for a systematic development
              of al-
gorithms on these models. The algorithms to be developed will range
              from
kernel algorithms for basic primitives to algorithms for important
              applica-
tions.
The research will expose unifying themes relating these
              well-
known models, and will result in fast and efficient parallel algorithms
              with
good performance on a wide range of parallel machines for large problem
              sizes
typically seen in practice. Additionally, this research will provide
              insight into
the fundamental benefits and limitations of parallel processing
              through the
investigation of asymptotically optimal algorithms and lower
              bounds.
