Abstract    :
              The NSF-REU Site in Physics at San Jose State University operates on a
              year-round basis, has a high minority and female participation, and draws from
              a large pool of well-qualified undergraduate Physics majors.  Most of the
              ongoing research projects are in the areas of optics, condensed matter, and
              computational physics - areas that represent the major scientific focus in
              high-tech Silicon Valley surrounding our campus.  Our summer program serves
              under-represented students from colleges in our region, and part of our
              year-round program provides support for students in industry-university
              partnerships.  This program component fosters important collaborations and
              facilitates technology transfer to the commercial sector.  Research results
              were reported with, in some cases, student participants as coauthors.  In
              addition, formal presentations by students were made at weekly REU meetings of
              students, faculty, and industrial scientists.
