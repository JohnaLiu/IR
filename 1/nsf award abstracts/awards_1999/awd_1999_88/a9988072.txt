Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Drs. Tom Livinghouse,
              Paul A. Grieco and other members of the Chemistry  Department at Montana State
              University in establishing and conducting a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002 30
              undergraduate students will spend 10 weeks each conducting summer research in
              organic synthesis, bioinorganic, natural product and structural chemistry. In
              addition to work on individual research problems participants will hear weekly
              seminars by the faculty and attend a series of talks by industrial chemists
              from pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms. There will be short courses in
              applied nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray
              crystallography. At the conclusion of the summer program there will be two half
              day symposia at which participants will present posters of their results.
              Students will participate as a member of a team composed of the faculty mentor,
              a graduate student and the REU participant. Participants will be encouraged to
              present their work at meetings of professional societies. Coordinators have
              been identified at two year Tribal Colleges in Montana and they will assist in
              recruiting Native American students for the program.
