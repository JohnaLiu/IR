Butler, Paul
"A Southern Hemisphere Search for Extra-Solar
              Planets"
AST-9988087

The PIs propose to extend their very successful search
              for extra-solar planets at Lick Observatory and Keck Observatory to the
              southern hemisphere.  In principle, even more stars harboring planets are to be
              found in the south, where the Galaxy's star density is greatest and little
              prior survey work for planets has been done.  Recent improvements in the iodine
              cell technique for measuring stellar radial velocities pioneered by the PIs now
              have the potential to detect 'Jupiter and Saturn analogs.' These are less
              massive and more normal planets than previously detectable.  The
              Anglo-Australian 3.9-m telescope will be used to survey the nearest 600 stars. 
              The results are likely to provide many planetary candidates for follow-up
              observations with the Space Interferometry Mission.
