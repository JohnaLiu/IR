Abstract    :
              The physics of the piano will be investigated through a combination of
              experimental measurements and theoretical modeling.  One of the primary goals
              is to develop a computational model of the piano, which will use Newton's laws
              to calculate a realistic piano tone.  The model will be tested an refined by
              comparison with experimental results for real pianos.  When completed, the
              computational model will enable detailed studies of how different parts of the
              instrument contribute to the tone, and how changes in the design of the piano
              would affect the sound produced by the instrument.
