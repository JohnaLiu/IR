Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to investigate formal modeling and 
analysis
              methods that are applicable to large-scale real-time distributed
systems, 
              such as networked virtual environments. The research focuses on
the
              development of techniques and tools for performance analysis of
network
              protocols and Quality-of-Service requirements analysis of the
network
              connecting distributed real-time applications.  
It is proposed to work on the
              following tasks:
1) Develop (extended fuzzy-timing Petri net) models for
              protocols in each
layer of network architecture;
2) Conduct network
              performance analysis and evaluate network effects on
several distributed
              real-time applications;
3) Focus on the development of new techniques to deal
              with the state 
explosion problem; and
4) Maintain an open library of models
              for real-time distributed
applications.
The significance and impact of the
              research are: 
1) Provide an integrated framework to conduct performance
              analysis for
large-scale real-time distributed systems with high efficiency;
              
2) Help designers of distributed real-time systems in testing, planning,
              
and improving their work; and
3) Help students learn formal modeling and
              analysis methods for 
network-based software design via graphic interface and
              simulation.
