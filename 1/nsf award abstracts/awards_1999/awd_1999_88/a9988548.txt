Abstract    :
              Energy Efficient Operating Systems for Pocket Computers

              Computer Science, Univ. of Colorado, Boulder

Many techniques have been
              proposed to combat processor and system
power demands. We propose to conduct a
              systematic investigation of
power conservation mechanisms and policies. The
              research will
construct an open-source, power-efficient operating system
              suitable
for next-generation, powerful palm-top computers. Moreover, we
              will
examine the possible energy reduction from application level
              energy
management using a a variety of runtime environments that
              collaborates
with the operating system to limit or control
              application-level
resource usage, including threads memory management. The
              research will
use existing high performance processors designed for mobile
              computing
as well as simulator processor power models to assess how
              power
demands can be reduced with minimal user intervention.  This
              research
is significant because it addresses one of the paramount
              issues
hampering the widespread use of ubiquitous computing, the high
              power
demand of such computers.
