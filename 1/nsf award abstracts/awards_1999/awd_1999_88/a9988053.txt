Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Dr. Marya Lieberman and
              other members of the Chemistry and Engineering Departments at Notre Dame
              University in establishing and conducting a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002, 36
              undergraduate students will spend 8-10 weeks each conducting summer research in
              synthesizing, characterizing and modeling materials to provide insight at the
              atomic level into their properties. In addition to work on individual research
              problems, participants will hear weekly seminars by the faculty and attend a
              series of mini courses on topics related to nano(atomic)scale phenomena such as
              aerosol chemistry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron microscopy. At
              the conclusion of the summer program each participant will present her/his
              findings at a research symposium. Students will achieve a realistic
              understanding of the demands of independent chemical research and gain self
              confidence in pursuing such studies.
