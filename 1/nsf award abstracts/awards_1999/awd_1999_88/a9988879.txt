9988879

The magnitude 7.4 Turkey earthquake of August 17, 1999 and
              the magnitude 7.6 Taiwan earthquake of September 20, 1999 were both widely
              recorded in the near fault region.  Together, they provide an unprecedented
              opportunity to understand the nature of large earthquakes and their effects on
              the natural and built environment.  Although most structures in the coastal
              regions of California are designed to withstand the ground motions form nearby
              earthquakes of magnitude larger than 7, there are practically no recordings of
              such earthquakes available for use in engineering analysis and design.  The
              data from these two events have the potential to greatly enhance the ability to
              characterize reliably the ground motions that control the design of structures
              in seismically active regions.

Due to the speed with which digital strong
              motion data are now available following a major earthquake, strong motion data
              were available to field reconnaissance teams when they visited Turkey and
              Taiwan, providing valuable guidance to engineers in their interpretation of the
              observed damage.  The rapid availability of strong motion data also provides
              the ability, by means of ground motion maps, to characterize the strong ground
              motions at recording sites and throughout the regions affected by these
              earthquakes.

The objective of this award is to support the development of
              these maps, based primarily on the recorded strong motion data.  These ground
              motion maps will account for site conditions using available information on
              broad geological categories of site conditions, such as alluvium, soft rock,
              and hard rock.  The parameters include peak acceleration, peak velocity, and 5%
              damped response spectral acceleration at periods of 0.3, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0
              seconds.  These preliminary maps are refined using two methods of interpolating
              between recorded ground motions.

These ground motion maps provide engineers
              with estimates of the ground motions experienced at specific sites, in order to
              interpret the causes of damage and failure observed in the reconnaissance
              investigations.  These ground motion maps will be placed on the World Wide Web
              to provide rapid and broad access to this data by the earthquake engineering
              research community.
