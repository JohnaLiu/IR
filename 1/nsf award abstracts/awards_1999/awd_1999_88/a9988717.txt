Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) of indigenous
              peoples has become recognized in recent years as a potential source of both
              specific information and insight by ecologists and biodiversity researchers. 
              Knowledge held by indigenous people has been compared to information gathered
              by western scientists and it has been demonstrated that TEK yields information
              whose quality is as useful as other sources of research data.  One concern of
              indigenous people is that studies of TEK may become dominated by non-indigenous
              investigators.  This symposium will bring together Native American trained as
              scientists and in touch with their cultural traditions to speak on the problems
              and solutions associated with the collection, use, and analysis of TEK.  The
              short-term goal is to familiarize students and other colleagues with the
              advantages and limitations of TEK; however, the long term goals for the
              symposium is to help develop recognition in Native American communities that
              rigorous but culturally sensitive routes exist to careers in science.
