Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT
The dominance of interconnect delay on modern circuit performance has
              resulted in a shift in design practices.  Modern design flows require both
              better area routing methods, and better support of performance constraints. 
              This project explores a new approach to area routing, placing first priority on
              the functionality of interconnecting wires, with design rule compliance being
              considered secondarily.  Under study are (1) methods to classify and
              characterize interconnect structures, (2) methods to evaluate the performance
              of groups of these structures, and (3) algorithmic techniques to select a set
              of interconnect structures which meet performance constraints and also obey
              design rules.  A practical area routing tool is being developed.
