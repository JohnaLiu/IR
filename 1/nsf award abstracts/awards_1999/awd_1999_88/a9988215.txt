Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the investigation of cold atomic and molecular ion-atom
              collision processes in a hybrid neutral atom-ion trap.  Recently developed
              techniques of laser cooling, trapping, and manipulation of cold neutral atoms
              will be used to make a refrigerator for the sympathetic cooling of an
              overlapping sample of atomic or molecular ions to very low temperatures. 
              Various aspects of the collision process will be examined, such as resonant and
              near-resonant electron transfer, the elastic Langevin cross section, and
              potential quantum effects on the scattering.
