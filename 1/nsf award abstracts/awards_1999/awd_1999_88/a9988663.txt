Abstract    :
              

Research in gravitational physics will simulate the production of
gravity
              waves by collisions between black holes. Water, sound
and electromagnetic
              waves are common examples of waves occurring in nature. A
revolutionary
              prediction of general relativity, Einstein's reformulation of
Newton's
              gravitational theory, is that accelerated masses produce gravity
waves
              analogous to the way electric charges produce electromagnetic waves.
Gravity
              waves have already been detected indirectly by their effect on
binary pulsars
              orbits. A Laser Interferometric Gravity Wave Observatory (LIGO)
sensitive
              enough to detect the waves directly is now under construction and
will open up
              a new form of astronomy. The knowledge of the shape of the wave
produced in a
              black hole collision is crucial to infer the collision process
from the LIGO
              signal.
