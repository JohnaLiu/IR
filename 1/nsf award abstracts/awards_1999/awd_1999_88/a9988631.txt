This workshop on the "Origin of Biological Motion" will
              take place at the Collegium Budapest-Institute of Advanced Studies, Hungary,
              during June 19-21, 2000.  Co-organizers, Gabor Forgacs of Clarkson University
              and Tamas Vicsek of Eotvos University will bring together junior and senior
              physicists and biologists who use quantitative tools for studying multiple
              aspects of biological motion.  The overall objective is to improve our
              understanding of the biological, mathematical and physical principles behind
              various manifestations of motion involving living organisms.  Specifically,
              participants will consider biological motion at three scales: 1) the molecular
              level; 2) the cellular level; and 3) the tissue and organismal level.  Results
              are expected to help focus and interpret recent experimental and theoretical
              work in this cross-disciplinary topic by producing and publicizing an agenda of
              recommended next steps for progress in the emerging field.

The "Biological
              Motion" workshop fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling experts from the United States and Central Europe to
              combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence.  Ideas brought forth at the workshop should
              form the basis of new collaborative research efforts that seek to understand
              the creation, organization and coordination of motion in biological systems.
