The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site
              project will bring eight undergraduate students, recruited nationally, to
              Flagstaff, Arizona for individual research experiences in astronomy. The
              program is open to undergraduates at all levels. The students will be paired
              with mentors from Northern Arizona University, the Lowell Observatory, the
              Flagstaff station of the U. S. Naval Observatory, the astrogeology branch of
              the U. S. Geological Survey, or visiting members of the National Undergraduate
              Research Observatory. Although not every field in astronomy research is
              available every summer, possible projects include work in planetary sciences,
              stellar astrophysics, extragalactic astrophysics, astrogeology, and
              instrumentation. In some of the projects, the students will have the
              opportunity to conduct observations on local telescopes.

In addition to
              their research work, students will attend a seminar series consisting of
              research talks by local and visiting scientists. At the conclusion of the
              summer, each student will turn in a written report of their work and will give
              an oral presentation of the results of the research.  As part of the
              experience, each student will receive three hours of university credit and will
              be housed together in a campus dormitory. Four students each year will be
              selected, and travel support offered, to present their work at a national
              professional scientific meeting.
