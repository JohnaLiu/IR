Abstract    :
              This project is on fast and accurate computational techniques for the design of
              3D embedded RF components. The numerical method to be investigated is based on
              a full-wave Mixed Potential Integral Equation formulation that has the
              capability of providing accurate modeling of 3-D interactions and handling
              arbitrary multi-layered media with different dielectric constants. Critical
              mathematical and algorithmic breakthroughs will be explored in the areas of
              fast calculation of multi-layered dyadic Green's functions over substrate, fast
              matrix solution of impedance matrices, high order basis functions, and fast
              frequency sweep techniques. Promising results from our initial investigations
              indicate that special numerical techniques superior to the techniques used in
              present software tools can be developed for 3D RF components in multi-layered
              media, and may lead to significant impact to the design of wireless systems.
              This project will also provide an opportunity for close interactions among the
              university team members and National Semiconductor Corporation - the industrial
              partner. Such an effort will strengthen the graduate education in both
              engineering and applied mathematics at participating universities, while
              industry will be benefited by potential fundamental breakthroughs of innovative
              and exploring research at universities.
