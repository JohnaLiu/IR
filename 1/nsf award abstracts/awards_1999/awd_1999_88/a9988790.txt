Abstract    :
              Professor Garfinkle will carry out a program of computational research in
              gravitation.  He will develop computational tools and use them to study several
              problems.  These include critical phenomena in collapse to black holes,
              generation of gravitational waves cosmic censorship and cosmology.
These are
              problems of active research at the frontiers of modern gravitional physics.
