The Physics Department at Arizona State University
              continues operation of a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The
              REU Site offers student research projects in areas of current interest in
              experimental and theoretical condensed matter physics.  Ten undergraduate
              students are recruited every year throughout the U.S. for a nine-week summer
              research experience.
