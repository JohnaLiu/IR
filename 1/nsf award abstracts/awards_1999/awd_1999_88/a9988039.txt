The University of Minnesota provides opportunities for
              undergraduate research through a multidisciplinary Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The REU Site is hosted by the Materials Research
              Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University of Minnesota.   Nine
              undergraduate students are recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week
              research experience.  Undergraduate students are involved in materials research
              projects that include microstructured polymers, artificial tissue, magnetic and
              porous materials.  In addition to working in individual research projects, REU
              participants attend personal and professional development workshops, research
              seminars and on-campus social events.  The REU Site benefits form other ongoing
              outreach efforts at the MRSEC, such as the summer program for faculty and
              students from tribal colleges in the region.
