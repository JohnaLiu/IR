Abstract    :
              The University of Louisville shall recruit and competitively select about six
              undergraduates each summer from across Kentucky and southern Indiana, both
              rural and urban areas, from all types of two and four year institutions.  Each
              student will work closely with a physics professor/mentor in the professors
              UofL laboratory on a self-contained research project for ten weeks.  The
              research areas include experimental and theoretical atomic, high-energy,
              nuclear, and solid-state physics.  The students and professors will participate
              in weekly seminars and journal club meetings to further communicate and learn
              more physics.  There will be several field trips to nearby national physics
              labs in adjacent states, social gatherings, as well as a special scientific
              ethics seminar.  These activities will allow the students to experience the
              true nature of physics research, which is unlike the cut-and-dried physics
              lecture classes which characterize much of undergraduate physics curriculum.
