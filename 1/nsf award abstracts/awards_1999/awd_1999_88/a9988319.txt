Abstract    :
              This research is on developing models and algorithms for design and analysis of
              optoelectronic systems to encompass micro-scale systems that integrate optical,
              electrical, and mechanical components. It is focused on five main topics: light
              propagation models for micro-optics, mixed-domain component models, a
              corresponding mixed-domain simulation environment, a 3D user interface, and
              design and analysis techniques that directly incorporate the additional
              performance concerns of mixed-technology systems. The algorithms being
              developed include new hybrid methods to model optical propagation in the
              micro-scale environment, techniques for creating consistent component level
              models across domains, and multi-time base simulation techniques. For the
              methodologies for mixed-technology design, the definition of performance is
              expanded beyond speed, power and area to include the additional concerns of
              mixed-technology systems such as noise, crosstalk and tolerancing. The research
              team is creating software tools, which will be made available to other research
              groups in both industry and academia.
