This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on three research vessels
              operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
              research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be acquired includes a new
              bathymetric sonar system for R/V Knorr, replacement sensor modules for CTD
              operations, drying ovens for shipboard analyses, software for onboard data
              analysis and display, a CTD profiler for use with DSV Alvin and towed vehicles,
              new dredges for rock sampling, replacement monitors for shipboard computers,
              and upgrades for shipboard computers.  The shared-use instrumentation supported
              here will assist marine scientists conduct studies throughout the world oceans
              during 2000 and future years.
