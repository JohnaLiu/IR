Abstract    :
              This project will generate alkenone unsaturation data to be compared with
              existing data on oxygen isotopes and the Mg/Ca ratio in planktic foraminifera
              from sites in the eastern equatorial Pacific spanning the last three
              glacial/interglacial cycles.  The goal is to assess how well the three
              geocehmical tracers for sea-surface temperature agree, and if there are
              systematic differences, to determine the possible causes thereof.
