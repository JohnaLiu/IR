Abstract    :
              The Physics Department at Vanderbilt University continues operation of a
              Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The REU Site offers student
              research projects in condensed matter/materials physics, optical physics,
              biophysics, nuclear and high-energy physics.  Ten undergraduate students are
              recruited every year throughout the U.S. for a ten-week summer research
              experience.  REU participants also attend research seminars, personal and
              professional development workshops, and some may also visit national
              laboratories in connection with their research projects.  This award is funded
              by the Division of Materials Research and of Physics of the Directorate for
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
