Abstract    :
              This award supports the continued development of the Cybertutor, a web-based
              Socratic homework tutor that challenges students with problems requiring them
              to respond analytically, draw vectors, and plot functions.  It grades their
              responses immediately and gives unlimited hints and subproblems at the
              student's request.  The new work will add new problems and modify existing ones
              in the Newtonian mechanics library and develop an algorithm to determine a
              detailed skill profile for each student that shows how much he or she has
              learned on each topic in the syllabus.   The range of problems will be extended
              by recruiting high school and college teachers to propose additional problems
              and test them in their classes.
