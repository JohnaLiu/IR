Abstract    :
              This ESH grant will support the operations of a planning office for Marine Earth
              System History (MESH) activities, a component of the USGCRP.  Activities
              include travel support for meetings of the MESH steering committee and for
              participation by US scientists in the International Marine Global Change
              Studies program (IMAGES), and coordination of a working group to study the
              feasibility of improving the US coring capability for very long piston
              cores.
