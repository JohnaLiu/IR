ABSTRACT

Slaman proposes to study computability and mathematical
              definability.
Slaman's long term goal is to provide a complete understanding
              of the
degree theoretic structures associated with relative
              definability,
such as the global structures of the Turing degrees (D) and
              the
enumeration degrees, as well as the local ones, such as the
              Turing
degrees of the recursively enumerable sets (R), the degrees below
              0',
and the degrees represented within an arbitrary Scott set.  Fixing D
as a
              paradigm example, Slaman proposes to investigate the scope of
first order
              definability within D, the automorphism group of D, and
the similarities and
              dissimilarities between D and proper subideals.  


Slaman proposes to study
              computability and mathematical definability.
With quantitative mathematical
              analysis of these phenomena, one can
answer questions of the form ``Is there
              an algorithm to solve all
problems of a this type?'', ``Is there a simple
              example with specific
properties'', or ``Is there a concrete classification of
              all
structures with these properties?''.  One can even address questions
of
              the sort ``Are these techniques adequate to resolve this
question?''.  One
              must develop a theory of algorithms to show that
there is no algorithm of a
              certain type.  Similarly, one must develop
a theory of definability to show
              that there is no simple example or
concrete classification.  In this proposal,
              Slaman focuses on the
Turing degrees: where one set A is above another B if
              and only if
there is an algorithm to compute B when given information about
              A.
The Turing degrees are an abstract representation of the structure
              of
relative computability.  Slaman proposes to study this structure, and
to
              pay close attention to the extent that the degrees of the definable
sets play
              a special role within it.
