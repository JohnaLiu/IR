ABSTRACT

This award is for the partial support of travel of 20
              investigators to the XIII International Congress on Mathematical Physics. The
              organizing committee and the list of plenary speakers include outstanding
              scientists in the fields of Mathematics and Physics. The list of topics to be
              covered at the conference is very broad and includes not only well established
              areas of mathematical physics such as general relativity and quantum mechanics,
              but also biophysics and quantum information theory. The selection of
              investigators to be supported will be made by the selection committee with
              preference given to young recent Ph.D.'s and outstanding graduate students. I
              strongly recommend the award.
