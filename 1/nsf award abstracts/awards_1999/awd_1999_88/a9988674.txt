In many systems in Nature constituents form a highly
              interconnected network, offering a level of complexity that makes them
              practically untreatable with traditional methods. Examples include the
              
metabolic network in a cell, social networks, business networks, the world
              wide web or the Internet.  The inability of contemporary science to describe
              these systems currently limits advances in many 
disciplines, ranging from
              molecular biology to computer science. The objective of the present proposal is
              to capitalize on the increasing availability of topological information on real
              networks to uncover 
the basic mechanisms that determine the network topology.
              Our exploration is driven by the conviction that the emergence and the
              evolution of complex networks are governed by generic mechanisms that are
              common to many systems. To achieve our goal we propose a research program
              composed of three steps.  First we plan to identify quantities that uniquely
              characterize the network topology, aiming to develop a set of measures, that
              eventually will allow us to construct a network with unique topological
              properties. Second, we plan to investigate the concept of universality: what
              are the 
mechanisms that determine the scaling exponents and the topology of
              the network. Third, we plan to study to which degree can a network be
              reconstructed from partial topological information.
