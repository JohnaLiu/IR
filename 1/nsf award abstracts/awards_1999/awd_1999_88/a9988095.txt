Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research project is to study the main aspects of information
              visualization through graph drawing models. The basic approach is to model
              complex data (having a hierarchical structure and/or temporal and spatial
              components) as graphs, and then formulate the visualization problem as a graph
              drawing problem. The quality of the resulting data representation is measured
              by an appropriate objective function that characterizes the quality of the fit.
              Efficient and robust algorithms will be developed for solving the underlying
              optimization problem. Furthermore, the effects of small perturbations of the
              data in their resulting graphical representation are assessed. The algorithms
              are tested on a wide variety of synthetic data and real data from the social,
              physical and life sciences. The methodology is implemented in GRAVIS, a
              proof-of-concept tool that will be freely available at
              http://www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~gmichail/gravis. The ultimate goal of the
              project is to establish a solid methodological and mathematical foundation for
              the problem of information visualization.
