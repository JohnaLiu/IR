The
              objective of this project is to use isotopic transient kinetic analysis (ITKA)
              to obtain in situ information on kinetic parameters for solid acid catalysts. 
              The work will focus on determining the nature of the high activity and
              selectivity of sulfated zirconia (SZ) catalysts for butane isomerization, a
              model reaction.  Parameters studied will include average residence time and
              concentration of active surface intermediates leading to iso-butane during
              n-butane isomerization on SZ and persulfated zirconia catalysts. Analytical
              techniques such as XPS, FTIR, NMR, and microcalorimetry will complement ITKA
              studies.  An overall goal of this work is to understand the nature of active
              sites such that the sites on future catalysts might be more precisely tailored.
               Several specific questions need to be answered about SZ catalysts before more
              rational design can proceed.  It is unclear why persulfated zirconia,
              containing a lower concentration of sulfate, gives higher activity for n-butane
              isomerization.  It is also unclear why alumina-promoted catalysts promote coke
              formation but also have better catalyst stability.  A successful solid-acid
              catalyst would replace liquid-acid catalysts, which lead to corrosion, catalyst
              separation, and environmental problems from acid recycle and disposal.
