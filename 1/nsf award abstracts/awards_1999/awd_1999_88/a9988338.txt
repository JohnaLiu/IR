Abstract    :
              This project studies the floorplanning problem from the standpoint of improving
              design productivity. The design productivity crisis faced by the semiconductor
              industry has been well documented in the National Technology Roadmap for
              Semiconductors, 1997 Edition. Floorplanning has a significant impact on
              productivity because of its interaction with architectural synthesis during the
              earlier stages of the design process and with logic and layout synthesis in the
              later stages of the design process. The research problems that are being
              addressed by this project include the white space distribution problem,
              incremental floorplanning, and intelligent post-floorplan analysis. This
              research is being carried out in consultation with Dr. Naveed Sherwani,
              Strategic CAD Labs, Intel Corporation.
