Abstract    :
              This research program focuses on the study the quantum properties of light in
              the femtosecond regime.  The major objectives of the program are:  1) to
              develop in the laboratory a reliable and efficient source of several quantum
              particles in specified entangled states; 2) to develop a theoretical framework
              for the modeling of such sources and to use this to understand how to control
              both the field and modal entanglement properties of the light; 3) to study
              experimentally the nonlocal properties of entangled beams particularly in
              relation to measures of nonclassicality of the radiation; and 4) to demonstrate
              novel methods for characterizing the quantum state of the light generated by
              such sources.
