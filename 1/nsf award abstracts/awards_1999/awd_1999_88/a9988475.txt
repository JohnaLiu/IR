The Oregon State University will operate the R/V Wecoma during
              2000 as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of NSF-supported
              research projects.  The Wecoma is a 185 ft. vessel, constructed in 1975, and is
              owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by Oregon State
              University.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 187operational days during
              2000, of which 101 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The
              remaining cruises will support Navy and NOAA projects.  The projects scheduled
              on the Wecoma represent several oceanographic disciplines, including HOME and
              GLOBEC projects, and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel.
              Operations in 2000 will mainly take place in the Pacific Ocean between Newport
              and Honolulu.  An open scheduled period in February and March will be used for
              maintenance, repairs, and crew training.

The Wecoma is part of a fleet of
              ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science
              research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to
              be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized
              ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing
              vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships
              specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by
              universities and institutions around the country.
