Abstract    :
              With assistance of a broadly-based Advisory Committee, the Louisiana
              Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (LaCEPT) is developing and
              coordinating a two-day conference of project directors and other
              representatives of CETP projects and related NSF-funded programs, including NSF
              Teaching Scholars.  The overall goals of the meeting are:  to further develop
              the collaborative network of CETPs so that each site can continue to learn from
              the others' successes and failures; to provide a forum for participants and
              other national leaders on critical issues to share perspectives; to provide
              opportunities for participants and other national leaders to address focal
              issues in small working groups; and to develop a readable and informative
              conference proceedings.
