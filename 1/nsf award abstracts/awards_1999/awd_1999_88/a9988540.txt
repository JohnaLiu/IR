Toward an Understanding of Contextual Factors in Software
              Development


With the rise of software architectures, frameworks,
              component-based
software engineering, design patterns, and other software
              development methodologies, it is becoming increasingly important to
              understand
the context in which different software development methods
              and
techniques are most effective.  This research will seek to provide
a
              theoretical framework for understanding the contextual and
domain-based
              factors that mediate between success and failure for
different software
              development contexts.  Particular emphasis will
be placed on tools and
              techniques that allow organizations to
systematically accumulate and improve
              knowledge of effective software
development practices within an organizational
              context.  Methods
for empirical observation based on ethnomethodology and
              activity
theory will be developed to establish and validate a
              scientific
basis for understanding critical success and failure
              factors.
Results of this research will be used to 1) Develop methods
              for
scientific inquiry that will lead to engineering disciplines for
software
              development based on domain and context analysis, 2) Better
understand the
              knowledge-intensive nature of software development
activities and how past
              experiences can be used as the basis for
improvement, and 3) Development of
              methodologies that integrate
modern, component and framework-based techniques,
              with contextual
factors that match application problems to specific techniques
              with
the highest probability of success.
