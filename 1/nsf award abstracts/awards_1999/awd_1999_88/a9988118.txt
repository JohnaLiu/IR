Abstract    :
              The Gordon Conference on Muscle: E-C coupling has been held every three years
              for three decades.  The conference has consistently been the sole forum for
              discussion and dissemination of advances in this field on a broad scale.  It
              has a proven record of bringing together active investigators from all over the
              world, in a format that encourages free exchange of ideas and unpublished data.
               The organizing committee has representatives of varying ages from five
              continents and this committee will strive to achieve appropriate representation
              of women, minorities and disabled for its 2000 meeting.
