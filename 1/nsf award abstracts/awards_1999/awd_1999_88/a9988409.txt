An Integrated Approach to Improving
              Design-Time and Run-Time Confidence

The proposed research addresses two ways
              to improve confidence in
software systems: design-time analysis and run-time
              monitoring.  The
design-time analysis is to verify design specifications with
              respect
to requirements, whereas the run-time monitoring is to assure that
              an
implementation is behaving as required.  The proposed research
              will
improve design-time analysis by means of domain-specific extensions
              to
analysis techniques and tools.  An extension for a chosen domain will
be
              based on specification patterns typical of the domain, and on
domain-specific
              abstraction mechanisms.  Furthermore, the design-time
analysis approach will
              be integrated with the run-time monitoring and
checking approach.  Since the
              success of this integration work will
depend on the characteristics of
              specific domains, the identification
of such characteristics will be part of
              the proposed work.  The
proposed work will be performed in the context of
              framework for
end-to-end system development of high confidence software, based
              on a
suite of methods and tools for the specification, analysis,
development,
              testing, prototyping, simulation and monitoring.  The
integration of
              design-time analysis and run-time monitoring is the key
novel aspect of the
              proposed work.  The proposed work will be
evaluated on a collection of
              applications chosen to represent domains
requiring high confidence and
              real-time requirements, such as embedded
systems and electronic commerce
              systems.
