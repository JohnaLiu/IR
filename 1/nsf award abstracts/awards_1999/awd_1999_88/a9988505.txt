Abstract    :
              This project is about the study of representations and algorithms for the
              computational modeling of human movements.  The ultimate goal is to devise a
              general representation of human motion structure that potentially covers a wide
              range of domains: from subtle lip motions during speaking and facial
              expressions, to complex hand and full-body gestures.  Possible applications
              include improved visual tracking algorithms, gesture classification tasks, face
              and body animation tasks, and new tools for bio-medical studies.  Corner-stones
              will be the use of large example motion databases and appropriate statistical
              estimation algorithms.  In this proposal, we specifically focus on techniques
              that can acquire kinematic models from video sequences. These models and
              measurements will be a building block for further studies on dynamics and
              higher-level human activity representations and will aid motion studies for
              research in bio-mechanical and medical projects.
