Windstorms in the United States, such as hurricanes and
              tornadoes, currently cause high levels of deaths and injuries, business
              interruption, a large amount of property damage, and disruption in the lives of
              people.  It is estimated that an average of more than 30,000 homes or dwelling
              units are destroyed or made uninhabitable each year as a result of extreme wind
              events.  Over the last twenty years, from hurricanes alone, the losses in the
              United States are $100 billion in 1999 dollars.

A symposium will be held in
              Washington, DC, during the winter of 1999.   The purpose of the symposium is
              two-fold: 1) to identify scientific and technical programs as well as public
              policy issues from architects, engineers, building code officials, builders,
              lenders and others involved in the construction industry, as well as
              decision-makers, and 2) to take steps toward innovative system-oriented
              developments of research thrusts in technologies for immediate and long-term
              approach for mitigating the impact of windstorms.  The venue for the symposium
              is chosen to permit easy access by all stakeholders in the connection industry
              and decision-makers.  The symposium will be open to the public.

The format
              for the symposium will be four keynote speakers in the mornings and afternoons
              of the two days and six panel discussions.  This format is designed to solicit
              participation by all attendees of the symposium.  The symposium is sponsored by
              the American Association for Wind Engineering and co-sponsored by several
              organizations including the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the
              National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Oceanic and
              Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency
              (FEMA), the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), and others.
