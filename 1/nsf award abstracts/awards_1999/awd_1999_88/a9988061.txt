The Physics Department at the University of Arkansas in
              Fayetteville continues operating a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
              Site in modern optics and optical materials. The REU Site builds on an existing
              undergraduate program in Modern Optics for science and engineering majors.  The
              program targets Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the region for
              student recruitment.  Ten undergraduate students are recruited every year for a
              ten-week summer research experience on topics that include semiconductor
              waveguides, diode lasers, and photorefractive crystals.

The program provides
              undergraduate students from the region with a research experience that
              encourages them to pursue further education and training in modern optics, and
              eventually provides better-trained students in this technologically important
              area.
