Near-infrared imaging of the region immediately surrounding
              the dynamical center of our Galaxy with the Keck 10-meter telescope over the
              last four years has yielded precise proper motion measurements of 90 stars. 
              The observed stellar velocities provide an accurate measure of the mass of a
              central black hole.  The ability to measure the orbital accelerations of a
              number of stars near the black hole opens a new range of possibilities for
              exploring the environment of a black hole in a galactic nucleus. Drs. Andrea
              Ghez and Mark Morris of the University of California at Los Angeles will obtain
              speckle imaging and adaptive optics near-infrared spectra of stars within a few
              arcsec of the Galactic Center in order to determine stellar orbits.  Knowing
              the orbits of several stars will constrain the possible presence and position
              of a black hole near the unique radio wavelength source Sgr A*.  This award is
              made through the Galactic Astronomy Program.
