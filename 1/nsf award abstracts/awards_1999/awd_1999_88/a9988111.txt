The investigators will work to enhance the ability of the research group at
              Michigan State University to continue state of the art research on several
              processes occurring in the outer layers of the Sun. The main effort is to fund
              a postdoctoral researcher to concentrate on parallelizing existing computer
              codes. This will vastly increase the speed of simulations to allow longer runs
              on larger volumes. In turn, this reduces effects of initial conditions and
              allows a more realistic treatment of the highly stratified solar plasma,
              subject to magnetic fields (throughout the volume) and radiative transfer (in
              the top layers). This research is extremely timely in an era of rapid advances
              in observational abilities to study solar p-modes, near-surface convection, and
              small-scale and/or weak magnetic fields. The project will fill an urgent need
              for numerical simulations to test and deepen the physical understanding of
              these phenomena.
