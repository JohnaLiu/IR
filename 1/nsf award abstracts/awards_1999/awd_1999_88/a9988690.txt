	This symposium, first presented in 1983, deals with the
              action of drugs that affect some vital body functions regulating maintenance
              and growth.  Drugs and endogenous physiologic chemicals reduce their effects by
              interacting with a macromolecular tissue constituent of functional
              significance, the receptor.   The particular receptors of interest here are
              those that respond to the endogneous chemical, acetylecholine, and to the
              mushroom poison, muscarine.  These so-called muscarinic receptors are located
              at many sites in the body and their activation or blockade can lead to changes
              in heart rate, stimulation or blockage of salivary and gastro-intestinal
              secretions, bronchiolar constriction among others.  Older drugs, such as
              atropine, which interact with the muscarinic receptors produce effects
              non-selectively at many sites.  However, as a result of research, the concept
              of different types of the muscarinic receptor-subtypes became a reality, and
              now many agents have been developed that act selectively at some muscarinic
              receptors and not at others, to produce the desired effects and fewer
              side-effects.  As a result of basic research on muscarinic receptors, new
              selective agents are available for treatment of genito-urinary and
              gastrointestinal problems, cardiovasular and pulmonary diseases, and the role
              of muscarinic receptors in Alzheimer's diseas, schizophrenia and glaucoma is
              being clarified.
