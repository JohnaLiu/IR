Abstract    :
              This is a three-year proposal submitted by a project team at the University of
              Colorado at Denver, to investigate how early-age temperatures affect the
              concrete maturity concept.  The objective of the proposed research is to
              address limitations with the methods currently being used to develop the
              maturity index-strength relationship, especially the method found in the
              American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), C1074-93, "Standard Practice
              For Estimating Concrete Strength by The Maturity Method".  The objective will
              be accomplished by developing a quantitative understanding of the effects that
              early-age temperatures have on the maturity concept, including the limiting
              strength.  
In order to fully understand these effects three main phases of
              testing will be implemented.  Each of the three phases is set up to evaluate
              the effects of temperature on two different concrete mixes.    
Once the
              effects of early-age temperatures are understood, a new method that takes these
              effects into account while developing the maturity index-relative strength
              relationship will be developed.  Ultimately, a revision to the ASTM standard
              C1074-93 method will be proposed.  The new method will be a modified version of
              the already developed maturity index-relative strength concept introduced by a
              research team at the National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST) in
              1984.
