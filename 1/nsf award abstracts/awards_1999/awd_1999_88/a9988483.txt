Abstract


This project will investigate measure-theoretic and
              information-theorectic aspects of central questions in computational
              complexity.  Resource-bounded measure will be axiomatized using higher-type
              complexity theory and will be extended to low-complexity (including
              finite-state) classes and function classes.  A variety of information-theoretic
              tools, including Shannon entropy, Kolmogorov complexity, and instance
              complexity, will be studied and applied in conjunction with measure to
              investigation in average-case complexity, completeness and weak completeness,
              derandomization, and propositional proof systems.  Weak completeness will be a
              major focus, especially in connection with natural examples and
              derandomization.  The explanatory power and reasonableness of the hypothesis
              that NP does not have p-measure 0 will be further be examined.  Related aspects
              of information and complexity that will investigated include computational
              depth and its variants, efficient algorithms for betting successfully on
              unpredictable data, and the feasible effectivization of classical  results in
              probability, stochastic processes, and information theory.  The project will
              involve students and other young investigators in progress toward the long-term
              objective of a greater synthesis between information theory and the theory of
              computing.
