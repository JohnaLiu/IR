Abstract    :
               The Interface Foundation of North America (IFNA), a non-profit educational

              corporation, sponsors a yearly meeting on the Interface of Computing
 Science
              and Statistics. This proposal seeks funding for Interface 2000, to
 be held
              April 5-8, 2000, at the Hotel Monteleon, in New Orleans. The 2000
 Symposium
              is organized around the theme of 'Modeling the Earth's Systems:
 Physical to
              Infrastructural,' and is intended to bring together subject
 area scientists
              and statisticians to discuss large, complex,
 multidisciplinary,
              computationally demanding modeling problems.  The
 keynote speaker is Grace
              Wahba (University of Wisconsin) with short
 courses presented by Wahba,
              Lorraine Denby and William S. Cleveland.
 Among other invited presentators are
              David Hand (Imperial College),
 Douglas Nychka (NCAR), Sally Morton (RAND),
              Lorraine Denby (Bell Labs),
 Sallie Keller-McNulty (Los Alamos), Paul Black
              (Neptune) and Cathy Dippo
 (Labor Statistics).  This forum, a  smaller focused
              meeting with a less
 formal atmosphere, will allow graduate students and young
              researchers to
 interact strongly with experienced researchers.
