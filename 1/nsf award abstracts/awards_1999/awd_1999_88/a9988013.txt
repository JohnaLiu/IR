Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Northern Arizona University will
              offer a summer research 
program for six students recruited nationwide.
              Minority students and students from colleges and universities 
without
              doctoral programs are especially encouraged to apply. The program will run for
              eight weeks in the 
summer, with each student working on an individual project
              tailored to his or her own mathematical background.  Students will work with a
              faculty adviser, but interaction with their peers is considered an important
              component of the program. The possible subject areas, which are to be widely
              interpreted, 
are Applied Mathematics and Combinatorics. Descriptions of
              projects available for the coming summer appear on the department's homepage at
              http://odin.math.nau.edu/REU/. As well as carrying out their research, students
              will participate in seminar series and will each give a fifty-minute
              presentation. Students will also write up their work in a form suitable for
              publication; these will put into a single bound volume and sent to each
              participant.
