ABSTRACT

     The study will
              evaluate expansion rate measurement as a possible rapid test method for delayed
              ettringite formation (DEF). Concrete specimens with different amount of
              potassium will be cast and stored under high moisture conditions to accelerate
              DEF.  The measured expansion rate data will be analyzed using nonlinear curve
              fitting algorithms based on the Incomplete Gamma function in order to extract
              characteristic expansion parameters.   These parameters will then be correlated
              with time-resolved measurements of the amount of ettringite formed, which will
              be determined through a combination of    scanning electron microscopy,
              quantitative X-ray diffraction, synchrotron radiation energy dispersive
              diffraction, and other means. In addition, computer tomography will be used for
              3D imaging of crack propagation. 
   Weight gain as a function of humidity
              cycling will also be explored as a possible alternative rapid test method.  The
              formation of ettringite or ASR gel involves the uptake of water, which results
              in a permanent weight, or mass, gain of the sample.   Since mass can be
              measured more sensitively and conveniently than length change, this suggests
              the possibility of replacing the expansion measurement with a weight change
              measurement that is more directly related to DEF.     
  The study will
              contribute to the understanding of the cause for the distress mechanism in DEF,
              and will contribute to the development of a rapid test method for
              DEF.
