Abstract    :
              	Several problems in probability theory will be studied. The first is the
              question of uniqueness for diffusions on fractals. For infinitely ramified
              fractals such as the Sierpinski carpet it is not yet known whether all possible
              constructions of Brownian motion whose state space is the fractal lead to the
              same process. This problem has applications to mathematical physics. Another
              concerns applying probabilistic techniques to the hot spots problem, a
              difficult problem in analysis. The hot spots problem is to determine where the
              solution to the heat equation with reflecting boundaries takes its maximum. A
              third problem is the estimation of the heat kernel, a problem that is related
              to partial differential equations. The heat equation for elliptic operators in
              divergence form has a fundamental solution that is comparable to that for the
              Laplacian. Is this true when the state space is not Euclidean space, but rather
              a more general manifold?
	Several problems in probability theory will be
              studied. They are all related to analysis and partial differential equations,
              in particular, to the heat equation. The heat equation governs the flow of heat
              as well as many other physical quantities. Interestingly enough, the study of
              random processes such as Brownian motion, can shed a great deal of light on the
              solutions of the heat equation in various media.
