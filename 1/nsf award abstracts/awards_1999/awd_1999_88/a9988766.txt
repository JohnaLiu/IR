Abstract    :
              Dr. Richard Schrock, Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
              Program of the Chemistry Division for research into metal-carbon multiple bonds
              and metallacycles. The objective is to develop new catalytic reactions
              involving olefins and acetylenes. The project will concentrate on the synthesis
              of new molybdenum catalysts that contain biphenolate and binaphtholate ligands.
              The mechanism of asymmetric olefin metathesis catalyzed by these species will
              be determined. Related tungsten complexes will be studied and asymmetric olefin
              metathesis catalyzed by them will be probed. 

Catalysts are important in the
              synthesis of specific reaction products and their use can result in significant
              energy and chemical savings.  The goal of this work is to systematically design
              groups attached to active metal centers in order to control their catalytic
              effects.  The specific systems studied contain nitrogen-based (amido) ligands
              and early transition metals. Facile routes to new asymmetric molecules will be
              devised. This will have great impact on, e.g., the pharmaceutical industry by
              providing new ways of obtaining pure enatio-isomers.
