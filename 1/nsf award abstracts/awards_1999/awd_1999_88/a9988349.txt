Abstract    :
              Abstract:

With the advent of the World Wide Web, there has been a
              fundamental
shift in the way information is exchanged among systems connected
              to
the Internet. There has been significant research in developing
techniques
              for eliminating performance bottlenecks arising due to the
lack of sufficient
              CPU, disk, and network bandwidths. While this
research has led to greater
              understanding about building a Web
middleware, it is not clear how a Web
              middleware can provide services
that can be customized to suit the needs of
              end users.

This research project aims to investigate two key ideas - support
              for
differentiated level of services and extensibility of the Web
components
              - to make a Web middleware more responsive and adaptive.
The research will
              first develop components that can control and
regulate allocation of resources
              to different requests. The research
here encompasses development of a quality
              of service (QoS) model with
respect to services and resources provided by the
              components,
exploration of QoS architectures, extension of the QoS model over
              a
wide area network, and investigation of a QoS model for web
caching. The
              project will then develop components whose behavior
can be customized to suit
              user preferences, Web object characteristics
and operating conditions.
