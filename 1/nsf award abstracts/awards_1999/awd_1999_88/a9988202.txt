Abstract    :
              This project will study the computational complexity of number-theoretic
              problems, which is relevant to both the theory and practive of computing.  On
              the practical side, computational problems in number theory arise in the design
              of systems for random number generation, cryptography, and computer algebra. 
              On the theoretical side, many of the classic questions about the relative power
              of various computational resources are crucial to number theory.  For example,
              if randomization is not necessary for polynomial-time computation, then there
              is a fast deterministic test for primality. 

This work falls into four
              categories:

a) designing improved models for the analysis of
              number-theoretic algorithms,

b) improving statistical tests of heuristic
              models for number-theoretic algorithms,

c) applying analytic and algebraic
              number theory to computations in number theory, and

d) incorporating
              efficient algorithms into the teaching of elementary cryptography.
