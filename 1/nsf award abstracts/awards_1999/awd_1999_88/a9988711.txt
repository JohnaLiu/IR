Abstract    :
              In this proposal,the PI will concentrate on the study of "locally flat"
              sets,
the geometry of the measures that they support,and the connections with
              harmonic
measure.Also,the PI will study boundary value problems under minimal
              smoothness
conditions,and the existence and regularity of solutions to
              two-phase free boun
dar problems.The PI will also study non-linear evolution
              problems,focusing on
Liouville theorems for parabolic regularizations of
              conservation laws,and on the
connection between oscillatory
              integrals,restriction theorems for the Fourier
transform,and the
              well-posedness of solutions to non-linear dispersive equations
and
              systems.


 The main guiding principle in the proposal is the development of
              various aspec
ts of harmonic analysis,potential theory and geometric measure
              theory,with a 
view to applications to a number of challenging problems in
              linear and non-lin
ear partial differential equations,and the implementation
              of these applications.
It is expected that this research will lead to the
              development of new graduate
courses,to Phd dissertations,and to the sposoring
              of a number of postdoc's reas
erch.
