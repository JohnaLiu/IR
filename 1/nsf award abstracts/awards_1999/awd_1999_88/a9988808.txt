Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this grant is the preparation of unique novel,
              potentially useful, polymeric materials by new syntheses employing inexpensive
              monomers/chemicals and conventional equipment.  The synthesis methods involve
              living carbocationic polymerizations (LC+Pzn) or a combination of LC+Pzn with
              other techniques, and are based on recently generated mechanistic insight . 
              While the emphasis is always on synthesis, the elucidation of
              structure/property relationships and a measure of mechanical testing to suggest
              utility are essential parts of the projects.  The proposal consists of four
              main projects and numerous subordinate projects: 1. Living Cationic Azeotropic
              Copolymerization of Isobutylene and Styrene, and Isobutylene/Styrene Copolymers
              Prepared by this Route.  2. Organic/Inorganic Hybrid Stars and Networks by
              Sol/Gel Chemistry.  3. New Thermoplastic Elastomers by Combination of Living
              Cationic and Radical Polymerizations.  4. Synthesis and Characterization of
              Novel Amphiphilic Membranes (two subprojects): A. Chemically Crosslinked
              Membranes, and B. Physically Crosslinked Membranes.

These projects concern
              the preparation of novel prototype materials and investigations suggesting
              utility for various engineering and biomaterials applications; therefore the
              potential impact on advancing knowledge in designed polymeric materials could
              be significant.  The projects will be carried out by graduate students in
              polymer science.
