Abstract    :
              On-chip inductance becomes an important design issue at transistor geometries of
              0.25 mm and below.  The primary goal of this project is to generate computer
              aided design tools and on-chip measurement techniques that will enable IC
              designers to cope with inductance related issues without the need for highly
              specialized knowledge or experimentation.  The project has three thrusts.  In
              thrust one, modeling and model reduction techniques will be developed that
              enable complex on-chip structures to be modeled and reduced so that they will
              be tractable for simulation.  The techniques are based on rule-based extensions
              to PEEC and wavelet-based extraction.  Thrust two is concerned with
              establishing an automated methodology to generate layout and performance margin
              guidance for use by designers.  At the center of this effort is the
              identification of a set of generalized parameterized interconnect topologies
              that capture most of the important issues related to inductance control. 
              Thrust three is concerned with measurement verification of the results of the
              other two thrusts and the determination of new automated in-situ measurement
              techniques.
