Abstract    :
              The proposed research addresses the problem of designing interconnect-optimized
              systems in deep-sub-micron technologies. All recent studies on the performance
              of VLSI systems in terms of timing, noise, power dissipation and related
              problems point to interconnect as a major factor. Thus, a central challenge in
              designing low-noise, low-power, high-speed reliable systems is to be able to
              estimate and optimize interconnect lengths, geometrical shapes, locations and
              thus delays, as well as minimize cross-talk by predicting and controlling
              mutual relations between individual wires. These problems are addressed by
              using (1) an innovative, interconnect-regular design representation (2)
              decomposition algorithms integrated with floorplanning and with simultaneous
              prediction, estimation and optimization of interconnect lengths, delays and
              cross-talk. The influence of process parameter variations is also
              considered.
