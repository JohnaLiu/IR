Title:            Heterogeneous
              Specification Formalisms for Reactive Systems

This project will investigate
              heterogeneous, mathematically rigorous modeling
and analysis techniques for
              embedded software.  The growing popularity of
embedded computer controllers in
              devices ranging from airplanes to 
pacemakers to electric shavers points to
              the importance of cost-effective
methods supporting the software they run. 
              Traditional specification
formalisms have emphasized homogeneous approaches in
              which all modeling and
analysis occur within one framework, such as
              Statecharts or temporal logic;
however, heterogeneous methodologies supporting
              multi-paradigm specifications
have strong practical motivations, and informal
              design notations such as UML
already provide superficial support for them.  To
              enable heterogeneous systems
specifications to be analyzed in a mathematically
              rigorous manner, thereby
providing designers with feedback in advance of
              implementation, the project
will pursue these lines of inquiry: the
              development of a uniform theory of
operational and logic-based system
              specifications; the study of mechanisms for
composing component models given
              in disparate formalisms; the implementation
of automated tool support for
              verifying the correctness of heterogeneous
specifications; and the
              investigation of case studies involving avionics
systems and communication
              protocols.  This research will enhance greatly the
capabilities of formal
              system modeling and analysis by providing a rigorous
basis for diverse
              embedded-software specification and verification
technologies to
              ``interoperate''.
