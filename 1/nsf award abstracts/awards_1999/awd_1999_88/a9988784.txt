Abstract    :
              This CNPq research project will enable a research group at the University of
              Massachusetts, Amherst to cooperate with a research group at the Artificial
              Intelligence Group at the University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. Together
              they will create a two-level multi-agent framework. At the higher level, a
              subsystem that reasons about symbolic information will be developed. Its
              activities pertain to domain-specific coordination tasks. At the lower level, a
              subsystem will be developed that reasons about quantitative information. Its
              activities pertain to feasibility and implementation operations. The two layers
              comprise interdependent activities that operate asynchronously. The lower layer
              provides feedback to the upper layer; the upper layer responds to the feedback
              by altering its tasks or performance objectives where necessary. Such an
              architecture will make it easier for multi-agent systems to function in open
              environments, such as the Internet, where the goals to be achieved, the
              resources available and the other interacting agents are dynamically changing.
