An Experimental Study of Broadcasting Protocols for
              Video-on-Demand
PI: D.E. Long

One of the most promising approaches to
              making video-on-demand services
more competitive is to continuously broadcast
              the most frequently requested
videos.  This research addresses three important
              limitations common to most
existing broadcasting protocols for
              video-on-demand.

A first research direction is the development of
              broadcasting protocols
that can handle compressed videos having variable
              bandwidth requirements.
The performance of these new protocols will be
              evaluated using a
representative set of videos in the MPEG-2 format used by
              DVD. 

A second research direction is the efficient implementation of
              interactive
functions analogous to those existing on a VCR.  These functions
              will allow
customers to pause, move backward and forward as if they were
              watching a
videocassette.

A third research direction is the design of
              broadcasting protocols that can
adjust their broadcasting schedules to all
              observed changes in the request
arrival rate.  As a result, these dynamic
              broadcasting protocols will
perform equally well at peak hours and at hours of
              lower demand.

All these broadcasting protocols will be demonstrated on a
              very simple
testbed consisting of a single workstation broadcasting a few
              specific videos.

 This is a collaborative research project between the
              University of
California, Santa Cruz and the University of 
Houston.
