This award to Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium
              (LUMCON) will provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V
              Pelican, a research vessel operated by LUMCON as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              instrumentation to be acquired is a fluorometer, which will be used to study
              chlorophyll concentration in surface waters using their automated shipboard
              flow-through seawater system.  The shared-use instrumentation supported here
              will assist marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in  the Gulf of
              Mexico, during 2000 and future years.
