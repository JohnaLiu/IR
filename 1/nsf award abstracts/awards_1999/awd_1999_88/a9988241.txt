Abstract    :
              Asynchronous (or clockless) digital design is the focus of renewed interest, as
              designers face increasing challenges in future chip design. These circuits
              promise three important benefits: high performance, scalability and design
              reuse, and low power.  This project is investigating two basic problems in
              asynchronous system design: (1) design of high-speed pipelines and pipelined
              datapath units (adders, multipliers, etc.), and (2) computer-aided design (CAD)
              algorithms and tools for the synthesis and optimization of distributed control.
                Multi-Giga Hertz asynchronous pipelines are being designed, where stages only
              communicate with their neighbors, and where timing optimizations are applied
              locally.  Using this approach, a substantial pipelined datapath component
              (adder/multiplier) is being designed, laid out and evaluated.  CAD tools for
              asynchronous distributed control are also being developed, using new bottom-up
              (clustering) and top-down  (partitioning) algorithms.
