Abstract    :
              This is a project to develop a "Retinal Readout System" that will allow the
              simultaneous detection of signals from hundreds to thousands of retinal output
              neurons while the retina is stimulated by dynamic visual images focused on the
              input neutrons.  The signals from the output neurons will be detected in real
              time, from a single living retinal preparation, with all spatial and temporal
              correlations among the signals recorded.  The Retinal Readout System will be
              based in part on the silicon microstrip detector technology and expertise
              developed to study short-lived particles in high energy physics experiments. 
              The work will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team with expertise in
              high energy physics, neurobiology, nanofabrication, and VLSI design.
