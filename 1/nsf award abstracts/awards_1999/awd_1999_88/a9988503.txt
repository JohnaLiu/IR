Abstract    :
                The investigator studies the methods of estimating the sum of exponential
              
sums, especially the sum of the Kloosterman sums, which explores the subtle
              
cancellation of the terms and which goes beyond the bounds of 
Weil and
              Deligne for exponential sums. The applications of such methods
to two
              outstanding problems are highlighted. 
  These sums are fundamental objects
              and arise naturally from a variety of 
open problems in number theory and
              harmonic analysis. The investigator 
studies the optimal way to estimate them,
              which potentially has striking
applications to several well known unsolved
              problems.
