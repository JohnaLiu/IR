The PI proposes to interpret scanning force microscopy (SFM) and
              surface force apparatus (SFA) experiments rigorously by molecular simulations.
              For simulations of SFM experiments on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs),
              tip-based molecular simulations will be carried out where an SFM tip scans at a
              constant velocity over alkanethiols/Au(111) in either constant height or
              constant load mode. The tip-cantilever system (TCS) will be explicitly
              described by representing it with three orthogonal springs connecting a rigid
              holder to the center of mass of the tip. A temporal-hybrid molecular simulation
              technique will be developed to extend the simulation time scale to that of SFM
              experiments. This method combines a dynamic element model for the TCS and a
              molecular dynamics relaxation approach for SAMs. Experimental values for the
              inertial mass of the TCS and spring constants of the cantilever determined by
              the PI's group will be used in the simulations. The hybrid technique will be
              used to study the dependence of friction on the chain length and terminal group
              of SAMs, scanning velocity and direction, tip size, and temperature. Simulation
              results will be compared with quantitative nano-scale frictional properties
              measured by the PI's group using SFM. Mechanical properties of SAMs (e.g.,
              lateral stiffness and elastic modules) and various energy dissipation
              mechanisms will be examined. The new hybrid simulation technique is of general
              significance. It can be applied to validate not only simulations of SFM and SFA
              experiments, but also simulations of nano-indentation and many other important
              problems involving different time scales. For simulations of SFA experiments,
              non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations will be carried out to study
              rheological properties of long-chain molecules in a grand canonical ensemble
              where confined fluids are in equilibrium with bulk fluids. This is an improved
              model for SFA experiments. In addition, novel lubricating strategies for
              applications in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) will be explored.
