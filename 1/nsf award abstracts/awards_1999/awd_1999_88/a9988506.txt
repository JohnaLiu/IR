Abstract    :
              9988506

Understanding the response of geomaterials such as soils and rocks is
              crucial in addressing a variety of problems in geotechnical engineering,
              earthquake engineering, environmental engineering, transportation, building and
              construction technology.

This research on the mechanical response of
              geological materials addresses four topics:
 The extension of an existing
              constitutive theory for porous rock into a fully three-dimensional theory.

              The inclusion of rate effects (inertial and frictional) into the constitutive
              theory.
 The development of rate-independent and rate-dependent constitutive
              theories for soils, including the effects   of water saturation.
 The
              application of these constitutive theories to the solution of relevant initial
              and boundary value problems  in geotechnical engineering and earthquake
              engineering.

The research utilizes a combination of micro-mechanical
              analysis (both theoretical and numerical) and empiricism based upon reliable
              experimental data.
