The University-National laboratory System (UNOLS)
              is an association of academic institutions established in 1971 as a
              coordinating a planning mechanism for oceanographic facilities operated by the
              member institutions.  The goal of UNOLS is to assist in the coordination and
              scheduling of facilities and shared-use equipment to provide efficient use of
              finite resources.  The UNOLS Office is the focal point for planning,
              coordination and reporting of UNOLS activities.

The UNOLS office provides
              administrative support services, supports ship scheduling through an electronic
              data base, disseminates ship request and schedules, analyses ship use, prepares
              committee reports, distributes marine regulations and other related information
              as necessary.  Support for special studies, Medical Advisory Service for ship's
              crew and scientist, travel expenses for UNOLS Committee members and consultants
              is also provide through UNOLS.

Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) will
              host and staff the office of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory
              System (UNOLS) in Moss Landing, California.

MLML will meet the needs of the
              marine scientists for ship operating institutions and ensure that the
              appropriate mix of the best facilities are available to scientist conducting
              marine science research and educational programs for UNOLS Vessels.
