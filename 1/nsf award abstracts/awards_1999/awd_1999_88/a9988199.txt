Abstract    :
              Recent advances have demonstrated how Quality of Service (QoS) at the resource
              management level brings content-rich applications, such as video-on-demand,
              visual tracking and tele-instrumentation, to our laboratories, and homes.  In
              order for these applications to make full use of QoS and in turn impact our
              lives in a beneficial, secure and economic manner, fundamental mappings between
              QoS/ resource-specific and application-specific parameters must be addressed. 
              Solving this problem is the next major step in bringing out the full potential
              of QoS.

Nahrstedt's research will address the systematic theoretical and
              experimental exploration of methodologies for matching between QoS/ resource
              and application requirements, resulting in a framework, called 'QoS Talk".  The
              primary objective of the research is to achieve effective "talking" between two
              different worlds.  To achieve this objective, 'QoS Talk' project will (1)
              develop concepts for matching of local and distributed resource management
              environments to application requirements and their QoS guarantees, (2) provide
              theoretical framework, building on top of models such as fuzzy control,
              adaptive control, probabilistic models, and (3) implement a testbed.
