Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses the problem of effective security control of extensive,
              heavily loaded power systems, focusing on the study of mechanisms and
              precursors of widespread oscillations, and on the problems of selecting
              effective controls in the face of limited data.  Its ultimate objective is to
              provide system operators with abilities to detect the imminence of potentially
              dangerous oscillations and to take preventive measures to avoid danger to
              equipment or the system.  It is confined to consideration of spontaneous
              oscillations caused by gradual changes in system conditions, and to
              oscillations due to disturbances.  "Forced" oscillations resulting from
              incomplete islanding or pulsating loads are not considered.  The proposal draws
              heavily on the recently defined concept of "strong resonance."  It is proposed
              that two lightly damped oscillatory modes interact near a resonance.  "If
              linearization is not diagonizable, the resonance is called "strong;" if it is
              diagonizable, it is called "weak."  An eigenvalue that changes in frequency
              before the resonance can change in damping after the resonance and become
              oscillatory unstable as the damping changes through zero."  Thus, modal
              resonance is considered as a possible precursor of power system
              oscillations.
