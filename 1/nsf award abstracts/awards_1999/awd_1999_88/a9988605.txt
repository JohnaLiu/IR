Abstract    :
              This research project proposes to study the programming productivity of global
              software teams from the dual perspectives of cultural variability and
              collaborative skills. Based on these two dynamics, the PIs will develop a
              framework, determine its validity and then establish the relative importance of
              cultural forces and collaborative skills on global team performance. An
              international research team of faculty at the Middle East Technical University
              in Ankara, Turkey and Sejong University in Seoul, South Korea are participating
              in this project. The three universities will set up global teams of
              undergraduate students doing joint programming tasks. Students will use a
              synchronous groupware system (with asynchronous communications capabilities,
              also) for their tasks. This research should provide useful insights into how to
              manage globally dispersed software development projects and the specific
              dynamics affecting global team performance, contributing to the theoretically
              motivated empirical studies on these topics.
