	Recent results from CERN seem to indicate that a new form
              of matter predicted by the strong interactions, i.e, the quark gluon plasma can
              be produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. Current and forthcoming
              experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven and the Large
              Hadron Collider at CERN 
with higher energies and luminosity will access this
              new state of matter which existed a few microseconds after the Big Bang. This
              proposal describes the continuation of a program to study non-equilibrium
              aspects of the phase transitions that lead to the formation and evolution of
              this novel plasma. The  goal of this program 
is to find experimental
              signatures of these transitions associated with strongly out of equilibrium
              phenomena by adapting and implementing novel techniques of non-equilibrium
              quantum statistical physics to study phenomena on time scales of 10^-22 seconds
              and spatial scales of 10^-14 meters. The program has experimental relevance for
              the search of the quark-gluon plasma and phase transitions at RHIC and LHC with
              potential for interdisciplinary impact in cosmology
and condensed matter
              physics.
