Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop a coherent mathematical framework in
              which asymptotically stabilizing feedback controllers for biped systems may be
              rigorously analyzed and synthesized. Feedback control is an integral part of
              both biological and mechanical biped locomotion. For the important cases of
              under actuated bipeds, none of the feedback controllers or stabilization
              mechanisms proposed in the literature has been proven to yield asymptotically
              stable motions. The lack of analytical progress is normally attributed to the
              inherent complexity of even the simplest biped models. The proposed work will
              be based on a recent breakthrough by Grizzle, Abba and Plestan. For the
              important special case of an under actuated biped with a torso and stiff legs
              (i.e., no knees), these researchers provided the first mathematical proof of
              the asymptotic stability of a feedback-controlled walking motion. This project
              will systematically explore feedback stabilization and design for a sequence of
              more realistic biped models. The models will be selected on the basis of their
              applicability to robotics, biomechanics and prosthetics, and will represent a
              wide range in the degree of (under) actuation.
