Abstract    :
              In this research program the silicon strip technology from High Energy Physics
              detectors is further developed for three dimensional particle tracking. 
              Fundamental questions about Lagrangian properties of turbulence are unanswered,
              and our ability to test theoretical models is very limited.  Important unsolved
              problems include statistics of the fluid particle acceleration, inertial range
              scaling of the Lagrangian structure functions, and n-particle turbulent
              dispersion.  This new technology allows to follow up to four particles in three
              dimensions at sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to provide the
              facility to measure single and multiple particle Langrangian statistics in the
              dissipation and interial range of high Reynolds number turbulence. 
              Simultaneously, new ways are developed to generate very high Reynolds number
              isotropic and homogeneous turbulence in flows with no mean velocity.  These
              measurements will provide much needed data to compare with theoretical
              predictions and may trigger new directions in theoretical research.  In
              addition, they will give important information needed to address problems of
              turbulent diffusion in many processes ranging from turbulent combustion to
              pollutant transport in the atmosphere.  It also promises the continued
              development of high speed strip detectors as a general purpose tool which can
              be used for many measurements where a weak light streak has to be followed in
              real time.
