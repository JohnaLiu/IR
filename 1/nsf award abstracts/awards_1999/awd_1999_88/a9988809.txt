              Abstract :

The Principal Investigator is Michael Shub. Shub and
              co-workers
Pugh, Wilkinson and others have established the stable ergodicity
              of a
wide range of partially hyperbolic dynamical systems which preserve
              a
smooth volume element, thus establishing the statistical robustness
              of
these chaotic systems. The thrust of the work proposed is to extend
these
              results to include almost all partially hyperbolic systems and to
eliminate
              the hypothesis of volume preservation. This is an ambitious goal,
but the
              results obtained included the development of new tools,  namely
julienne
              quasi-conformality and julienne density point preservation of the
stable
              holonomy maps, whose power has not been fully explored. 
A second theme is a
              study of the complexity of continuous problems centered around the
analysis
              and application of variants of Newton's method.

Chaotic dynamical systems
              are pervasive in scientific, engineering and
numerical simulation
              applications. The proposed work would lay foundations
for the statistical
              analysis of these systems, whose deterministic behavior is
unpredictable due
              to the presence of sensitive dependence on initial
conditions. Newton's method
              for solving systems of equations is one of
the main algorithms of numerical
              analysis. A better understanding of its
properties and those of variants can
              make the solution of problems of
scientific and engineering origin more
              efficient.
