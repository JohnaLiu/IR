Abstract

Two complementary areas of computational complexity
              theory will be studied. The first is the complexity of quantum computing, a
              project that my colleagues and I have begun work on during the past two years.
              To this point two projects have been completed, both concern finding lower
              bounds for classes of quantum computations. I propose to continue to explore
              the power of quantum computation and try to obtain both lower and upper bounds
              by relating quantum classes to classical complexity theory. The second area
              concerns the study of the complexity theory of natural combinatorial functions
              in PSPACE. Here the goal is to make use of the extensions of the polynomial
              hierarchy, which were defined and explicated in an earlier paper on the
              hyperpolynomial hierarchy. Tools such as the NP-jump and the methods of Toda's
              theorem will be studied and extended in order to classify counting problems and
              other natural complex problems in PSPACE. We intend to explore this new
              framework for the classification of optimization problems and to study the
              relationship between older notion such as alternation and the extended
              polynomial hierarchies which we have defined.
