Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT:

Krantz proposes to study the groups of holomorphic
              self-mappings
(automorphism groups) of domains in complex space using
              techniques of real
and complex analysis, differential geometry, Lie theory,
              and partial
differential equations.  The goal is to identify invariants that
              will help
to classify domains up to biholomorphic equivalence.  In
              another
direction, Krantz will study real-variable Hardy spaces on
              domains,
pursuant to earlier collaborative work with Chang and Stein.
              Finally,
Krantz will collaborate with Marco Peloso in his continuing study of
              the
inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations in the Sobolev
              topology.
Applications to mapping theory and the study of the worm domain are
              being
developed.

Professor Krantz will study aspects of complex analysis
              related to
symmetry.  The notion of symmetry is measured by means of mappings
              of
domains.  The set of such mappings of a region in space to itself has
an
              algebraic structure which is called a ``group''.  The properties of
this group
              reveal geometric structure of the region under study and
vice versa.  This
              idea of attaching an algebraic invariant to a
geometric object is one of the
              big thrusts in twentieth-century
mathematics, and uncovers new depth and
              texture in the subject.
Krantz's study of these ``automorphism groups''
              complements his
continuing study of certain partial differential equations on
              these
spatial regions.  The partial differential equations can be used
              to
construct mappings, and to calculate their regularity properties.  As
an
              ancillary to these two projects, Krantz will study certain spaces
of functions
              and mappings which are called Hardy spaces, and whose
existence was inspired
              by the mapping questions.  The geometric study
of complex function theory in
              several variables has applications in
cosmology (thanks to work of Penrose)
              and in geophysics.
