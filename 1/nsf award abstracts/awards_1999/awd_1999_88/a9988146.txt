Abstract    :
              Drs. Martin Weinberg and Neal Katz of the University of Massachusetts will carry
              out  two interrelated, but independent, projects aimed at understanding the
              structure, evolution, and interaction between the halo and luminous components
              of galaxies in general, but focused primarily on our galaxy, the Milky Way. 
              

The Milky Way is the ideal and possibly the only galaxy that qualifies as a
              subject for this study. Different evolutionary histories are likely to produce
              unique but subtly different responses. Tests of these
              multi-component
interactions will require the photometric and kinematic detail
              that only our own galaxy can offer.  Similarly, the simultaneous evolution of
              the Milky Way's companions, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, by the same
              dynamical mechanisms will further constrain inferred scenarios. The
              near-infrared star counts offered by the 2MASS project together with diffuse
              and molecular gas surveys enable a deep theory-data comparison and help plan
              programs for upcoming high-precision kinematic data. This project will for the
              first time unify these dynamical mechanisms theoretically and provide detailed
              observational diagnoses for their consequences. In the end, conclusions based
              on the study of the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds will have significant
              implications for galaxy evolution in general.
