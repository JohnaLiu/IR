Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is on developing techniques and algorithms that
will
              allow idle workstations to be opportunistically exploited for parallel
and
              distributed shared-memory applications. The target environments range
from
              local-area networks (LAN's) to wide-area networks (WAN's). The
              central
challenges are competition from other applications for workstation
              and
network resources, load imbalance arising from differing system speeds,
              and
heterogeneity.

The intent is to design and build as transparent a
              system as possible. Such
a system will need new methods of deriving dynamic
              sharing and processor
capacity information online, new load-balancing and
              thread-migration
heuristics that minimize both communication and load
              imbalance in dynamic
environments, and easy-to-use API's that will provide the
              type information
needed to address heterogeneity. The end result of this work
              will be a set
of techniques, policies, and code that will allow
              shared-memory
applications to be transparently migrated across a set of
              non-dedicated
workstations. In allowing otherwise-unused resources to be
              exploited by
this new application domain, this research will significantly
              expand the
value of incrementally-deployed sets of workstations.
