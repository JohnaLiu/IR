The PI
              will investigate a physically interesting and a technologically important
              problem: the sediment transport that derives when "ephemeral ripples burst"
              with the concomitant transfer of sedimentary material.  The PI and his research
              group have carried out self-supported initial studies that give excellent
              promise of significant contributions from this NSF supported effort.
