Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research on the chemistry of main group metallacarboranes and
              metallaboranes by Professor Narayan Hosmane of the Department of Chemistry and
              Biochemistry at Northern Illinois University. The reactivity of the "carbons
              apart" tetracarba-nido-dodecaborane and fused [B22H22] anionic and [C2B22H22]
              cages with s-and p-block elements will be investigated. In particular,
              compounds resulting from reaction of Cs, Sr, Ba, Ga and In with these cages
              will be synthesized, and subjected to structural and theoretical studies. The
              ability of some of these cage compounds to extract Cs ion from aqueous solution
              will be determined, as will the extent of their versatility as synthons for the
              production of a variety of full and half-sandwich complexes containing main
              group, d-and f-block elements.

The goal of this research is to produce a
              number of new and novel compounds containing cages of carbon and/or boron
              combined with  heavy metals or semi-metals such as gallium and indium. These
              materials may find use in remediation by helping to reclaim cesium from
              radiactive wastes and as precursors in the formation of semiconductors,
              ceramics and catalysts. The students involved in this project, both graduate
              and undergraduate, will learn a breadth of synthetic and calculational skills
              and gain experience in the environmental and industrial applications of the
              work.
