Abstract    :
              This award supports the continuation of an experimental program to investigate
              the fundamental interactions of positrons with free atoms and molecules.  
              Earlier measurements on positron-hydrogen scattering and positron-alkali atom
              scattering, particularly with regard to positronium formation, will be extended
              to include atoms and molecules not yet investigated.   In an expansion of the
              program, new experiments using cross-beam investigations of positron-alkali
              atom scattering will focus on (1) formation of positronium in excited states,
              (2) excitation of the atoms by positron impact, and the comparison of this
              process with electron impact excitation, and (3) differential atomic excitation
              cross section measurements.
