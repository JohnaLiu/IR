              Abstract:

The area of analysis called geometric measure theory (GMT) was
              formally
introduced in the nineteen sixties, when the book ``Geometric
              Measure
Theory'' by H. Federer was published. Since the beginning of the
              century a
large amount of relevant work had been done in this area by many
              authors
including Besicovitch, Carath\'eodory, De Giorgi, Federer
              himself,
Fleming, Marstrand, Morrey, Reifenberg, and Whitney. However it was
              only
when Federer's book was published that it became clear how all
              these
results fit naturally together as a cohesive subject. Unfortunately
              since
its introduction the subject has been perceived as somewhat mysterious
              and
inaccessible. In this proposal the investigator exploits one of
              the
outstanding features of the field, its versatility. The PI intends
              to
apply techniques of GMT to study free boundary regularity problems,
              to
answer questions regarding the existence of good parameterizations
              for
certain metric spaces and to classify sets supporting
              ``Lebesgue-type''
measures.



Free boundary problems arise naturally in
              physics and engineering. The
free boundary may appear as the interface between
              a fluid and the air, or
water and ice. In the filtration problem, which
              studies how water
filtrates from a dam made of a porous medium (say earth),
              the free
boundary separates the wet part from the dry part. The problem
              of
characterizing the regularity of the free boundary has been studied
              by
many authors, among others Alt, Caffarelli and Friedman. In this
              proposal
the investigator addresses this question under very weak free
              boundary
assumptions. By relaxing the regularity hypothesis a broader spectrum
              of
physical problems can be covered.  The investigator also proposes to
              study
the structure of sets supporting measures that behave like
              Lesbegue
measure on an affine space. In the context of weak notions of
              regularity,
these sets play the role of tangent planes.  In particular the
              problem of
classifying these sets is of primary importance. The ideas
              discussed here
belong to a larger project that intends to establish that weak
              notions of
regularity are for many purposes sufficient to answer basic
              questions in
analysis and geometry.
