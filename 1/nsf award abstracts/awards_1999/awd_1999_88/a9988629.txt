Abstract    :
              Professor Mark Ediger of the University of Wisconsin Madison is supported by the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to perform thermodynamic
              studies of the structure and dynamics of supercooled liquids and the
              glass/liquid transition.  The PI uses neutron forward recoil spectrometry and
              neutron reflectivity to assess self-diffusion in thin bilayer samples of
              deuterated and nondeuterated molecules. Samples include small polar glass
              forming molecules such as glycerol, propylene carbonate and water.   Secondly,
              a solid state NMR method new to this application is being used on several
              supercooled liquids and films providing structural information as a function of
              temperature.     New types of data will provide important benchmarks for
              theoretical efforts in predicting phase transitions in condensed
              phases.

Despite having a long history, the area of supercooled liquids and
              the glass/liquid transition has many fundamental unanswered questions about the
              nature of molecular motions near the transition point and the influence of
              structure on properties of glass forming materials. An improved understanding
              of the glassy state will have impact on materials applications including
              polymer science.
