Abstract    :
              Software tools based on data-flow analyses can automate many software
              engineering tasks.  These tools, however, are rarely used in practice because
              existing data-flow analyzers are prohibitively expensive or too imprecise for
              use with large software systems written in languages that contain complex
              language constructs such as pointers, arrays, and function-valued variables. 
              The primary goal of this research is to develop data-flow analyses that are
              sufficiently efficient and precise in practice to analyze programs when those
              programs are under development, testing, and maintenance.  The research
              involves three primary efforts: development of efficient and effective
              data-flow analyses for C Programs; performance of large-scale experimentation
              to evaluate the algorithms and to guide the direction of the later work; and
              investigation of the application of the techniques to object-oriented
              languages.  The proposed research will have several tangible results: it will
              provide information about how practical data-flow analyses can be created; it
              will construct prototypes and assemble a set of experimental subjects for use
              in evaluation of the results of the research and demonstration of the
              practicality of the algorithms; and it will use discoveries about data-flow
              analyses as a starting point for developing such techniques for object-oriented
              programs.
