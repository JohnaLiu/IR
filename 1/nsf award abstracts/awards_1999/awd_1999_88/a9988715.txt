Abstract    :
              This research project investigates the design and analysis of market-based
              mechanisms for decentralized scheduling. Market price systems are well known to
              effectively decentralize decisions in idealized situations, but real scheduling
              problems present constraints and interdependencies that can defeat simple
              market schemes. In this project, market failures arising from the inability to
              couple interdependent resources are addressed through more sophisticated market
              structures that allow traders to express complex contingencies. The resulting
              system will be analyzed using game-theoretic and evolutionary techniques.
              Results from this work will lead to novel practical scheduling mechanisms that
              can be deployed within e-commerce and other distributed contexts. New design
              and analysis methodologies will demonstrate how to extend the resulting
              mechanisms to other classes of decentralized allocation problems.
