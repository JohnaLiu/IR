   Title: Automated Methods in the Analysis and Verification of
              Concurrent 
          Systems
   PI: A. Prasad Sistla

Abstract: 
 The
              project investigates various methods, based on temporal 
logic model-checking,
               for automated
analysis of concurrent and distributed systems
              including
security verification of Internet based applications such
as
              e-commerce.
Hybrid techniques, employing symmetry and partial order
              based
methods, will be investigated for containing
the state explosion and
              for checking both safety and liveness properties.
The project also considers
              work on  verification of systems
 composed of arbitrary number of processes.
              
Verification of such systems
with different network topologies will be
              explored. 
As part of this work, induction based techniques as well
              as
algorithmic techniques will be developed. The security verification
              will
consider different security properties, intruder and protocol
              models.
The project emphasizes both basic research as well as experimental
              
work in the form of implementation
and application to real-world problems.
