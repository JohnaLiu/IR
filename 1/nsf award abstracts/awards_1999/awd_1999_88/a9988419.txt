Abstract    :
              This research is on the climatic effects of volcanic eruptions, focusing on the
              1991 Pinatubo eruption.  The PIs have produced an aerosol data set that they
              will employ for this study.  The work will include organizing an international
              climate model intercomparison of Pinatubo simulations.  They will conduct their
              own simulations using this data set and the GFDL SKYHI GCM. A by-product of
              this project would be a data set of stratospheric ozone changes following the
              Pinatubo eruption and a comparison of the radiative forcing due to the ozone
              changes to those of the aerosols.

This research is important because it
              might lead to an improved understanding of the climatic effects of tropical
              volcanic eruptions
