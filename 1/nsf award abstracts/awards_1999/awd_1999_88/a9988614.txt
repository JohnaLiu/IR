Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to investigate the fundamental problem of pattern
              formation: how organized structures can spontaneously arise in a structureless
              environment.  Experiments are planned on a rich model system for  studying
              pattern formation: electrohydrodynamic instabilities that arise in nematic
              liquid crystals.  Specifically, the following three areas will be investigated:
              energy transport measurements and their use as quantitative tests of competing
              models of electroconvection; b) the origin of a crucial length scale only
              partially selected in dendritic growth; and c) the competition between
              equilibrium and non-equilibrium transitions.

The study of spatio-temporal
              flow instabilities in nematic liquid crystals is crucial to optimizing this
              class of liquid crystal materials in various device applications.    This
              project, in cooperation with predictions based on the latest theoretical
              modeling from our collaborators, will significantly enhance our understanding
              of patter formation outside equilibrium in intrinsically anisotropic systems. 
              Not only are these studies of fundamental scientific and technological
              importance, they are also represent invaluable opportunities for training
              graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in a diverse array of useful
              techniques and skills.
