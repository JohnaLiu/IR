Abstract    :
              The ultimate goal of this research project is an understanding of how the
              biological activity of heme proteins is influenced by the dynamic interaction
              of the protein backbone with the heme group.  Advances in x-ray synchrotron
              nuclear absorption spectroscopy permit, for the first time, measurement of the
              heme Fe vibrational density of states under various conditions of oxidation,
              temperature, ligand configuration, and optical excitation.  This detailed
              dynamic information will be obtained in experiments at the Advanced Photon
              Source from proteins that span a range of heme-backbone coupling
              configurations.   Comparisons with results from microperoxidase and other
              truncated versions of heme proteins will help illustrate the non-local
              heme-backbone interactions.  This comprehensive set of vibrational data with
              then be used to refine the force constants used in non-linear normal mode
              calculations of heme protein dynamics.  This project is jointly supported by
              the Physics Division in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and
              by the Molecular Biophysics program in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.
