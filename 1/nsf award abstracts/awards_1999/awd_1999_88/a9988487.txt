The goal of this project is to refine and further
              develop the 
new insights and tools for the treatment of quantum symmetry
in
              noncommutative geometry which emerged from the recent joint work 
of A. Connes
              and the PI, in order to expand their range of 
applications to transverse
              differential geometry, the algebraic 
and the analytic theory of quantum
              groups, as well as to quantum 
field theory. The main new insight, that
              symmetry in Diff-equivariant
geometry comes organized in the form of specific
              Hopf algebras,
will be investigated for all geometrically interesting classes
              of
transverse geometries and then employed to settle the
              corresponding
transverse index problem. The main new tool, provided by the
              
adaptation of cyclic cohomology to Hopf algebras, will be applied
to obtain
              new cohomological invariants of quantum groups and of their
actions. 

The
              proposed work is motivated by the necessity of developing
appropriate
              mathematical tools for handling a wealth of examples
of non-classical spaces,
              arising in many areas of mathematics and physics, 
whose common feature is
              that their measurable local parameters behave
like infinite-dimensional
              matrices rather than numbers. This requires a
considerable stretching and
              rethinking of the existing geometric 
techniques and led to the development of
              noncomutative geometry. The
emphasis of the present project is on the the
              treatment of such
noncommutative spaces in the presence of non-classical
              symmetries.
