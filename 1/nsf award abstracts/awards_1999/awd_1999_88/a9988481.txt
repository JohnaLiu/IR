This award to University of Rhode Island will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Endeavor, a research
              vessel operated by the university's Graduate School of Oceanography as part of
              the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.
              Specific instrumentation to be acquired includes a spare CTD system, including
              both underwater and surface electronics, for use with both the Endeavor's CTD
              system and the portable undulating vehicle operated by URI, and a remote
              control system for operating the undulating vehicle winch (with video camera
              and monitors).  The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist
              marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in  the northwest Atlantic, but
              also from ships of opportunity elsewhere in the world, during 2000 and future
              years.
