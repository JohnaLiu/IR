This FASEB Summer Research Conference on
              "Posttranscriptional Control of Gene Expression," will held on July 16 to July
              21, 2000 in Copper Mountain, Colorado. The conference is organized under the
              auspices of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
              (FASEB), and will bring together international scientists studying translation
              and mRNA decay, in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Of key interest to
              this meeting are exciting new observations focused at interface between
              translation and decay, and the mechanisms by which these two complicated
              processes are coordinated. The conference format consists of nine major
              sessions, five in the morning and four in the evening, spanning five days. An
              afternoon poster session and two afternoon round-table discussions are
              included. Afternoon activities and mealtimes represent opportunities for
              interaction and discussion that might not occur during the more formal oral
              sessions, especially among junior and senior scientists. There will be
              approximately 45 invited lecturers, with another 10 selected from the
              applicants. Special attention will be given to new investigators, as well as
              women and minorities.   Given rapid developments in this important area, we
              expect the 2000 conference to foster further exchange, interaction and
              collaboration among investigators working at different levels in the field.
