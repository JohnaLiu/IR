Discovering the Profiles and Patterns of
              Software Evolution

Software evolution refers to the dynamic behavior of
              
software systems as they are maintained and enhanced 
over their lifetimes. 
              Software evolution is of increasing
 importance as systems in organizations
              become longer-lived.  
However, empirical studies of software evolution face
              particular
 challenges due to the longitudinal nature of the evolution
              
phenomenon.  As a result, there is relatively little scientific
 knowledge
              about how software systems actually evolve. 
This research has the objectives
              of developing and evaluating 
models of the process of software evolution. 
              Specifically, 
this research seeks to: (1) Identify typical patterns in the
              
changes to software systems over time, (2) Determine the extent 
to which
              the patterns coalesce into distinct evolutionary phases,
 (3) Understand why
              systems follow similar or different 
evolutionary paths, and (4) Develop and
              evaluate models that 
predict the evolutionary patterns of software systems. 
              
The empirical evaluation involves collecting, coding, and 
analyzing more
              than 25,000 change events that occurred over 
20 years in 23 commercial
              software systems.  Given the relative 
paucity of research on software
              evolution, this study should yield 
unique insights that contribute to theory
              building.  In addition, 
longitudinal empirical data and databases on software
              change 
histories will be created that are novel, detailed, and of high
              
quality.
