ABSTRACT      Andrew Webber   Proposal # DBI - 9988027


All life on this
              planet is ultimately dependent on photosynthesis for its energy requirements. 
              At Arizona State University the Center for the Study of Early Events in
              Photosynthesis, comprised of faculty in the departments of Plant Biology,
              Chemistry and Biochemistry, takes an interdisciplinary approach to
              understanding the energy storage process carried out by photosynthetic
              organisms and mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems.  Undergraduate
              students will participate in the individual research programs of the Center
              faculty.  Projects will include organic synthesis and spectroscopic studies of
              model compounds, spectroscopic studies of bacterial and plant photosynthetic
              reaction centers, and molecular biology and genetics of photosynthetic systems.
               Structured interaction between faculty and student participants, including the
              weekly photosynthesis seminar series, research group meetings, instrumentation
              workshops and a concluding undergraduate symposium, will help educate the
              students in the extremely diverse modem approach to the study of
              photosynthesis.  Student participants will be recruited from throughout the US,
              with emphasis on targeted colleges and universities in the West and Southwest
              United States, with the help of local department chairs and individual
              faculty.
