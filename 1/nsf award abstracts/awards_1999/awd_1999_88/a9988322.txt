Title: Developing Linear-Time Model-Checking
              Technology
Project-summary-paragraph:

Model checking is a key technology in
              formal verification.
As it is generally practiced today, model checking is
              basically
an efficient symbolic search procedure based on fixed-point
              computation
that checks whether a model of the design satisfies given
              CTL
specifications.  In spite of the phenomenal success of CTL-based
              model
checking, CTL suffers from several fundamental limitations as
a
              specification language, all stemming from the fact that CTL is
              a
branching-time formalism: the language is unintuitive and hard to
use, it
              does not lend itself to compositional reasoning, and it is
fundamentally
              incompatible with dynamic validation.
In contrast, the linear-time framework
              is expressive and intuitive,
supports compositional reasoning and semi-formal
              verification, and
is amenable to combining enumerative and symbolic search
              methods.
Surprisingly, the linear-time framework, even though it preceded
              CTL,
and does not suffer from its weaknesses, has not enjoyed the same
              
intensive research focus as CTL, resulting in a much less mature
technology.
               This projects builds upon the theoretical foundations of
the linear-time
              framework that have been laid over the last 20 years, 
and focuses on
              generating a body of knowledge that industry can convert
into a robust
              technology.
