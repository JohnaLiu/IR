Layden

Dr. Andrew Layden of Bowling Green State University will
              direct a research program comprising four distinct projects that have the
              overall objective of improving our understanding of the old stellar populations
              in our Galaxy.  Dr. Layden will do photometry of RR Lyrae stars in the globular
              cluster NGC3201; he will do a survey of RR Lyrae stars in metal-rich globular
              star clusters; he will use RR Lyrae star observations as a tool to measure
              interstellar reddening; and he will investigate the history of star formation
              in the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy.  The research program is distinguished by the
              level and extent of student involvement which will serve to promote
              undergraduate education and experience for pre-service teachers at Dr. Layden's
              institution.  This award is funded out of the Galactic Astronomy Program in the
              Division of Astronomical Sciences.
