Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

Cholak plans on studying the interaction between definability
              and
computability in various structures in mathematical logic. Primarily,
but
              not totally, Cholak will focus on the collection of all computably
enumerable
              sets under the inclusion relation and the computably
enumerable degrees under
              Turing reducibility.  Cholak's long range
goals are to provide a complete
              understanding of the relationships
between these two structures and their
              automorphisms and definable
orbits.

Cholak's main focus is on definability
              and computability.  These
notions are both important in measuring the
              complexity of an answer to
a mathematical problem.  One develops an
              intertwined hierarchy of
definability and computability.  Only answers which
              lay on the lowest
level of complexity are computable and even then are not
              always
feasibly computable given today's computers.  Answers of
              higher
complexity provide useful mathematical information and allows the
              user
to test the limits of their mathematical techniques.
