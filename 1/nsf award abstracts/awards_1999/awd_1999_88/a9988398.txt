As radio waves travel through our Galaxy they are
              distorted by the inhomogeneous plasma in interstellar space.  This creates a
              "seeing" problem for radio astronomers, comparable to atmospheric seeing for
              optical astronomers.  The source is blurred, pulses are broadened, and constant
              sources appear to fluctuate (scintillate).  The scintillations have to be
              recognized and separated from fluctuations which are intrinsic to the
              astronomical source.  At the same time the scintillations provide a unique
              probe of the turbulence in the ionized interstellar medium.  Drs. Barney
              Rickett and William Coles, at the University of California at San Diego, have
              considerable experience in the theory and observation of such phenomena.  With
              this award they will refine the current understanding of the spatial and
              spectral distribution of the interstellar plasma, and they will apply the
              results to the study of the ionized interstellar medium and to extremely
              compact extragalactic radio sources, including the afterglows from Gamma-Ray
              Burst sources. This award is funded through the Galactic Astronomy
              Program.
