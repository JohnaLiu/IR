Abstract    :
              This is a project in the study of control of spatiotemporal complexity in
              nonlinear optical systems.  Spatiotemporal irregularity and spontaneous pattern
              formation are intrinsic and universal phenomena in nonlinear optical systems
              that may seriously degrade the operation of the system in certain critical
              applications.   The work will focus on studying spatiotemporal control in a
              unidirectional ring resonator that uses a refractive crystal to provide
              two-wave mixing gain and a laser that operates with many transverse modes.  The
              experiments will be accompanied by theoretical calculations using a
              two-dimensional model for the resonator and a one-dimensional model for the
              laser.
