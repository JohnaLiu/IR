Abstract    :
              This REU opportunity at the University of Toledo's Lake Erie Center will give
              students the opportunity to collaborate with faculty on an environmental
              problem of global significance by using the Maumee River watershed as a test
              case.  A ten-week summer program will expose students to the environmental
              degradation of the Maumee watershed, the major environmental and social
              processes involved in that degradation, and the related policy/legal issues. 
              Students will be drawn from all over the United States, with particular
              attention paid to students from universities which primarily serve groups
              underrepresented in science.  Students will then be teamed with a faculty
              mentor to conduct a research project that will evaluate a specific aspect of
              environmental degradation/land use change, demographic/social factors, or the
              policy implications of a particular problem.  The final week of the research
              experience will consist of a student project symposium in which students will
              present their research results and discuss the overarching processes that unify
              their research efforts.  Guest professionals will attend these meetings and
              will also provide an overview of the significance of environmental/policy
              research training for real-world careers.  In addition, these community
              partners will evaluate individual projects as well as the overall program.
