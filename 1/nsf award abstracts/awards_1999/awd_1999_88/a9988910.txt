The Third International Conference on Complex Systems
              (ICCS)
is being organized for May 21-26, 2000. There is a new and 
growing
              effort to understand complex systems and complexity 
that has stimulated
              widespread interest in the scientific 
community. Scientific sessions will
              focus on unified 
conceptual and mathematical strategies and their
              applications 
to physical, biological and social systems. The conference
              
includes pedagogical sessions for students and topics of 
interest and
              concern to the public that will serve as 
vehicles of education and
              communication for a broader 
audience. Various conferences and workshops have
              addressed 
aspects of these growing efforts to understand complex 
systems.
              However, the ICCS is the only major international 
conference series to bring
              the wide diversity of research 
together, demonstrating the interdisciplinary
              yet 
integrative and coherent nature of these efforts. This 
conference
              series is organized by the New England Complex 
Systems Institute (NECSI).
