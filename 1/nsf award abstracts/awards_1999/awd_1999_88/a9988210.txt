Title:  RUI: Design of Object-Oriented
              Programming Languages

The overall goal of this research is to improve the
              design of
statically typed programming languages, especially
              object-oriented
programming languages.  The main projects for the next three
              years
include the following: 1. Consolidating and disseminating knowledge of
              OO language design,
type theory, and semantics, by completing a monograph
              presenting the 
results of recent research in this area. 2. Investigating
              further issues in the design of language features
for programming in the
              large, especially with object-oriented
languages.  3. Investigating typed
              intermediate languages and other
implementation strategies for object-oriented
              languages.
We intend to continue using the language LOOM as a test bed for
              further
investigations into the best way to support features
              of
object-oriented languages, while also investigating how to use the
best of
              these ideas to enhance real languages like Java and its
successors.
