Abstract    :
              	Under this award, Dr. Betts will investigate the thermodynamics of atmospheric
              energy and water interactions from the land surface to the troposphere.  At
              present, forecast and climate models have serious deficiencies in their
              physical parameterizations, particularly in the modeling of energy and land
              transports at the land surface,  and in the coupling of the surface and
              boundary layer to convective processes.  The principal investigator will
              address these issues by analyzing observations from various field programs, and
              then using them to diagnose and correct errors in the physical
              parameterizations in large-scale models.  Operational forecast models will be
              used, primarily the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF) model,
              so that this research directly benefits the forecasting of weather on
              time-scales from a few days out to the seasonal time-scale.  In addition, the
              research will help to improve the global reanalyses produced by operational
              forecast centers which are key databases for climate studies.

	The goals of
              this research contribute directly to the objectives of NSF's WEAVE program
              under the USGCRP and to the goals of the International Global Energy and Water
              Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) effort.
