Integration Architecture
              Theory

Current software development practices frequently incorporate the
              reuse of
multiple, existing, and often heterogeneous, components in a
              single
application. This style of development is thought to increase
              adaptability
and evolvability of the resulting integrated system.
              Unfortunately, it also
manifests complex interoperability conflicts among
              participating components.
Though commercial middleware is being touted as
              resolving these problems,
often its use results in incomplete solutions, which
              are neither flexible
nor evolvable. To overcome these problems, it is
              necessary to capture and
codify the inherent nature of interoperability
              conflicts in order to
determine and apply appropriate resolution techniques in
              a principled
manner. Toward this end, this project focuses on developing a
              theory of
integration founded on formulating software architecture
              descriptions of
interoperability conflicts, mapping these conflicts to
              resolution
strategies, and defining a formal composition of these strategies
              as they
are used in middleware frameworks. The goal of this research is,
              therefore,
to provide key resources at a foundational level to make principled
              and
repeatable design decisions that result in more complete and
              adaptable
integration solutions.
