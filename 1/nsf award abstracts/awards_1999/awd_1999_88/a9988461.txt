The role of hot oxygen atoms on the chemistry,
              composition and the thermal structure of the atmosphere will be studied. 
              Doppler profiles of emissions from electronically excited O(1D) atoms will be
              calculated.  They are extensively used to determine thermospheric temperatures
              and neutral wind velocities.  A major source of energetic oxygen atoms in
              ground (3P) and excited (1D) states is phototodissociation of O2 by solar
              ultraviolet radiation. Theoretical procedures will be applied to the
              quantitative determination of the cross sections, branching ratio and energy
              distributions of O (3P) and O (1D) atoms in the photodissociation of O2.

Hot
              oxygen atoms are an important heating source of the neutral thermosphere. 
              Their rate of thermalization strongly influences the heat and energy balance of
              the thermosphere.  Semiclassical and quantum mechanical scattering calculations
              will be performed to evaluate the cross sections for collisions with both gases
              which thermalize the hot O atoms.  By inserting the cross sections in the
              solutions of the Boltzmann equation, the non-equilibrium energy distribution
              functions of these atoms will be determined.
