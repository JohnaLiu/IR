Abstract    :
              With this award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the
              work of Dr. Stephen F. Nelsen at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.   The
              research aims to probe the details of electron transfer (ET) reactions in
              organic intervalence compounds - compounds with two charged units connected by
              a bridge of connected atoms where the only difference between the two units is
              the amount of charge, and also between molecules of known oxidation potential. 
               Intervalence compounds have no driving force (the energy is the same
              irrespective of which unit has the higher charge), and provide a good test of
              theoretical models.   ET reactions are very important in both chemistry and
              biology, and are found for example in photosynthesis and
              respiration.

Intervalence compounds show a charge transfer band arising from
              a vertical ET transition induced by absorption of a visible photon.   Compounds
              with  organic charge-bearing units that are stable, and have high internal
              reorganization energies, will be synthesized and studied in order to measure
              rate constants for thermal ET and to compare the experimental results with
              theoretical models.
