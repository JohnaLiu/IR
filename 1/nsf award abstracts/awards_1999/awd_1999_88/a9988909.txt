Abstract    :
              The need for rapid assessment of the performance and safety of civil structures
              has been amply demonstrated during recent natural disasters.  The objective of
              this research is to develop an integrated system for monitoring the condition
              of a civil structure, utilizing advanced sensing, microprocessing, wireless
              communication and damage diagnosis methods.  The integrated framework will be
              prototyped and tested both in the laboratory setting as well as in the field
              ironment.  The goal is to change the practices from using extensive cabling and
              high cost labor and equipment to the instrumentation of inexpensive, easily
              installed, maintained and operated wireless embedded systems.
