Abstract    :
              The research to be performed will develop simulation-based algorithms for
              numerical solution of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which can be used to
              model complex systems in manufacturing, telecommunications, and finance.  Two
              new approaches that offer potential benefits not found in currently available
              methods will be explored.  The first approach will use ordinal optimization
              (OO) for choosing actions in the backwards induction step for finite horizon
              problems, or in the policy iteration or value iteration step for infinite
              horizon problems.   The second approach will use simultaneous perturbation
              stochastic approximation (SPSA) for optimizing high-dimensional parameterized
              MDPs.

If successful, the results of the research will lead to dramatically
              more efficient algorithms for solving MDPs of practical interest in a number of
              application areas, from financial engineering to production systems.   The
              impact of successfully applying high-dimensional solution methodologies to
              these problems would represent a major advance in developing computationally
              tractable methods for solving complex problems of sequential decision making
              under uncertainty.   Furthermore, theoretical results are envisioned that would
              rigorously establish faster rates of convergence for the new algorithms over
              convergence rates from usual Monte Carlo simulation.
