Abstract    :
              The National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering (NISEE) provides
              comprehensive, public access to technical research knowledge, applications,
              research software, and education information in earthquake engineering and
              earthquake loss reduction and the related fields of structural dynamics,
              geotechnical engineering, engineering seismology and earthquake hazard
              mitigation policy and economics.  As part of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program (NEHRP) strategy with ties to earthquake engineering research
              centers, NISEE serves a growing audience of engineering and design
              practitioners, students, and educators, policy makers, the media, local
              organizations, government, and the general public through the Internet
              <http://www.eerc.berkeley.edu/>, print (reports, newsletters, manuals), by
              exhibiting (regional, national and international conferences and workshops) and
              by personal contact (phone, fax, email, visit).
