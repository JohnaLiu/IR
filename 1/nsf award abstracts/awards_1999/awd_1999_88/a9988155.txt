"Compositional Techniques for Verification and Performance
              Analysis
	of Reactive, Probabilistic Systems"

The research proposed here
              has as its objectives: (1) to develop
significantly improved techniques for
              the formal specification,
verification, and performance analysis of systems
              that exhibit
concurrent, reactive, probabilistic, and real-time behavior; (2)
              to
construct implementations of these techniques in the form of
              efficient
computer-aided design tools; and (3) to assess these tools
              and
techniques and guide their further development by applying them
              to
problems drawn from actual real-world engineering practice.  In
              this
research, attention will be focused primarily on finite-state
              system
models.  A key characteristic of the approach is
              compositionality,
which permits a large system to be described as the
              composition of a
collection of simpler components and to be analyzed in
              a
component-by-component fashion.  This research will build on previous
work
              of the PIs, in which they developed a model, called
"probabilistic I/O
              automata" (PIOA), for the compositional
specification of reactive,
              probabilistic systems, together with
compositional performance analysis
              algorithms for this model.  The
proposed project would advance the state of
              the art in the area of
formal specification and verification techniques for
              finite state
systems, which holds promise for enabling more efficient
              production of
more reliable software systems.
