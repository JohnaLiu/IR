              Next Generation Software:  Workshop on Active Services

The dramatic increase
              of internet-based applications and the proliferation of networking technologies
              has been transforming most areas of computer science and engineering as well as
              computational science and commercial application areas.  We feel strongly that
              this provides an outstanding opportunity to explore new, internet-oriented
              software technologies that will open new research and application opportunities
              for a range of constituencies, from the high-performance computing to the
              commercial multimedia and end-user communities.

To this end, we propose the
              organization of an NSF-sponsored workshop on Active Services in conjunction
              with the 1999 Grids Forum Workshop to be held at Northwestern University.  By
              "Active Services" we mean a new software paradigm which will support the
              operating environment, network support, control and communication protocols,
              development and application environments for intelligent software agents which
              we refer to as software scouts.  Scouts could be used for a variety of new
              scientific applications, intelligent network and systems software, and end-user
              applications.

We would like to request NSF sponsorship of the proposed
              workshop which will facilitate the participation of 30-35 of the most active
              and accomplished researchers in related areas.  The workshop will be open to
              the entire community.  However, we rely primarily on the participation and
              contribution of the most active researchers in relevant fields and as such it
              will be an invitation-based workshop.  We have already contacted several of the
              proposed participants who have already agreed to participate in the discussions
              and also contribute short presentations.
