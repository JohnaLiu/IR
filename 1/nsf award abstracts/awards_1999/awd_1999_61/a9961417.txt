Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to research and
              develop modular software for generic multisensor/actuator intelligent nodes
              containing commercial embedded microcontrollers and/or digital signal
              processors (iPod).  The software provides an autonomous multiprocessor network
              with operational computational data processing and actuation capabilities which
              can 'enable more efficient, safer and more satisfying products and services to
              improve quality of life in both work and home environments and to augment human
              capabilities'.  It would consist of an instrument development environment
              (IDE), an ActiveX-like object (iBroker), and an embedded virtual machine (EVM).
               The IDE generates run-time commands (applets) for the PC and the iPods.  The
              iBroker, as intermediary, links the iPods embedded microcontrollers to a PC
              and/or a larger network through a master.  The EVM residing on each iPod
              utilizes downloaded applets and communicates through a master to the iBroker
              and beyond. While some software components have been tested in programs both
              here and elsewhere, a research effort is needed on a modular, over-arching
              program for a sensor based multiprocessor systems that can fully utilize their
              networking capabilities while providing real time multiprocessing of
              sensor/actuator information.  In Phase I, this software will be tested on
              Scitefair's recent flow measuring nodal network.
