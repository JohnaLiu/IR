Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from PhRAM Inc.
              ITAL will produce a working and testable prototype of a comprehensive
              educational tool and it will obtain initial evidence of how the proposed
              software works with students and how it is accepted by teachers.  ITAL's
              software is designed to create educational modules and tools that will help
              teachers assemble a single computer-based learning environment from
              heterogeneous educational resources and the WWW.  The proposed open-ended
              package will include an Active Shell, Modeling Activities, Problem Solving
              Tutor, Interactive Lessons and a tool to design them, Tools for Assessing
              student progress, and more. Virtually everything in the software can be
              controlled from a script.  The proposed software package employs a 'learning
              situation-focused' approach.  The Simulation module is based upon a 'real-life
              situation'.  It enables learners to actively participate in modeling and
              virtual experimentation and observe the physical processes from macroscopic to
              microscopic levels.  The software allows students to assemble various
              functioning systems from intelligent components and link science content and
              technology education with real life technical problems and thus to cross a gulf
              between applied knowledge and fundamental science.  The software may be used in
              classrooms equipped with stand-alone computers or local networks or it may be
              used over the Internet for distance learning.
     PhRAM's software is
              designed to address high, technical and vocational school and college students
              and teachers as well as people engaged in any kind of distance learning,
              including those with disabilities.  The product can be used by companies for
              training technicians.  It will also target the marketplace of computer-based
              design and engineering, and it will be useful for presenting household hardware
              to the customers.
