Abstract    :
                    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project aims to apply
              novel micro-discharge structures and techniques for exciting micro-lasers. The
              proposer will target wavelength regions not accessed by other compact lasers,
              emphasizing output wavelengths in spectral regions where diode pumped solid
              state laser approaches are considerably more complex than the proposed
              technology. The Phase I objectives include the development of the alignment and
              construction methods needed to make a stack of micro-discharges appropriate for
              laser action. The proposer will show laser action in the touchstone systems of
              the Mid-IR Xenon atom laser and the KrF laser in the ultraviolet. An analytical
              effort using state of the art, multi-dimensional discharge models will support
              experiments and guide the Phase II prototype design.  The proposer will also
              define the needed risk reduction tests to produce a useful sensor system in
              Phase II.
          These very compact sources will be used in sensors for
              trace species detection, process control, and medical and food industry
              applications. The small size and low voltage operation will lead to inexpensive
              hand held uses and very compact automated industrial systems. The
              semi-conductor based fabrication techniques are inexpensive and systems based
              on this technology can significantly enhance the market potential. Specific
              commercial applications include: trace gas sensors for short ranges, screening
              solid surfaces and foods for pathogens, process controls, and fiber coupled
              probes for medicine.
