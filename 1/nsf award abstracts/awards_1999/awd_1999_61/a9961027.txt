Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I Project will develop a novel
              integrated process for manufacturing and interconnecting a 3-D array of
              transistors made of carbon nanotubes, suitable for large-scale manufacturing. 
              This large-scale, low-cost approach will provide extremely fast, low-power,
              ultra-high-density logic and memory devices, which operate at room temperature.
               The fundamental enabling innovation of the proposed process involves
              introducing controlled discontinuities in the structure of the carbon nanotube.
               We estimate that our fabrication technology will enable device densities of
              10^12 per cm^2, limited only by lateral interconnect technology.  A novel
              interconnect technology will also be investigated to provide device densities
              to 10^14 per cm^2.
