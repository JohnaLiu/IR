Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new technology to reclaim tungsten carbide (WC) directly from WC-cobalt (Co)
              scrap, generated each year by the cutting tool industry in an amount worth 2
              billion dollars.  Since segregation by grade is nearly impossible in that it
              must be collected from end users and since mixing grades is highly likely, a
              recovery process that focuses on WC is needed.  Current methods for recovery
              are tedious, time consuming, and expensive due to use of highly corrosive
              chemicals and high energy consumption.  The proposed electrochemical process
              will eliminate the hydrogen reduction step and the recarburization
              step.

Recovered WC can be re-coated and remanufactured into WC-Co tools for
              applications in machining, ore
drilling, in forming tools and dies, and
              nozzles for oil and natural gas burners, inkjets and abrasive waterjet cutting.
               Other applications for recovered WC include materials used in electronics,
              composite coatings for wear resistance, and counterweights for gyroscopes.  The
              electrochemical approach is expected to result in significant cost savings in
              the recovery process by reducing the amount of chemicals used, lower the
              equipment infrastructure use of chemicals, and reduce energy costs.
