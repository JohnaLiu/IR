Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              the feasibility of a high-performance, low-cost, computer-aided garment design
              and pattern flattening (GDPF) system.  Using a new three-dimensional (3D)
              camera technology, the GDPF system would enable the custom fit of apparel. 
              Since the human body is inherently a 3D object with complex shapes and
              dimensions, the design and production of garments, shoes, hats, and other
              apparel products must fit.  That is, the 3D shape of the apparel piece must
              match the body shape, style, and fashion selection of individual customers.  
              Since no two human bodies are exactly the same in their 3D dimensions, the
              first critical step in the custom fit apparel design is to obtain 3D body shape
              measurements for individual customer.  Today, almost all existing garment
              computer-aided design (CAD) systems only use 2D manual measurements as their
              input and 2D representation in their designs.   Phase I will examine the use of
              the new 3D imaging technology in providing 3D specifications for CAD
              software.

Potential commercial applications are anticipated in the garment
              and fashion industries.
