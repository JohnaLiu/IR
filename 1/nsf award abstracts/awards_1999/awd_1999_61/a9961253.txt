Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a
              low cost process to synthesize ultrafine titanium carbide (TiC) powder from its
              chloride precursor and to consolidate this powder, along with metal powders, to
              produce fine grained composites.  Major impediments to the wide spread use of
              TiC-based composite materials for high temperature structural and cutting tool
              applications are their low fracture toughness and high cost of production. 
              Increase in toughness and reduction in cost may be achieved simultaneously by
              producing composites using nanocrystalline carbide powder synthesized by a low
              cost, ambient temperature mechanochemical process.  Phase I will focus on
              optimizing the parameters which control (i) the reaction rate during the
              mechanochemical process, (ii) the particle size of metal matrix powders during
              milling with hard TiC to produce composite powder, and (iii) grain growth
              during consolidation.  The research objective is production of cost-effective
              composites with a nanoscale grain size.

This process technology has
              potential as a commercial technique for synthesis of ultrafine metal carbide
              powders used in products like metal matrix composites and titanium carbide
              cutting tools.
