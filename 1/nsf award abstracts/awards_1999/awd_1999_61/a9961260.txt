Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new magnetic position sensing technology that utilizes a novel graded magnetic
              field and giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor.  The graded magnetic field is
              produced in a composite film comprising samarium cobalt (SmCo5) nanorods
              imbedded in an alumina matrix.  High coercivity, high magnetization SmCo5 is
              desirable so that the sensor may be employed in extreme environments.  The
              composite is produced using well-known electrochemical techniques.  A GMR read
              head is used to sense the strength of the magnetic field as a function of the
              position of the sensor over the graded field.  This arrangement is superior to
              conventional position sensing devices in that the proposed device may be
              integrated into a single package along with control and signal processing
              electronics.   Phase I will investigate the fabrication of the graded magnetic
              field composite and determine the best conditions under which to produce high
              coercivity SmCo5 nanorods.  Phase II will continue the development of a
              monolithic position sensor for automatic test equipment.

These
              high-resolution sensors, that can be readily integrated with silicon based
              electronics, will be useful in robotics, automated test equipment, and in
              interactive electronic devices.  Successful implementation of the proposed
              technology will enable disk drives to be built with data densities exceeding
              100 gigabytes per square inch allowing smaller, faster storage systems for
              portable systems, digital video recording, and digital TV.
