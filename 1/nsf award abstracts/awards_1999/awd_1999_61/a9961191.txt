Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from LASERMIND proposes
              to design and build an innovative scientific teaching tool that will improve
              high school physics students' understanding of the principles of light and
              energy.  The need for better understanding and knowledge of physics in
              secondary education in this country is paramount.  Physics teachers need a
              simple, safe, durable, and hands-on approach to teach students the principles
              of light.  The proposed learning system, Laser-Wave Explorer, will meet the
              needs of teachers and students.  The unique feature of this Laser-Wave Explorer
              system is the all-in-one design requiring no mechanical assembly.  The advanced
              design interlinks seven combinations of optical components together into one
              system.  Through inquiry-based hands-on learning, physics students can perform
              over 30 different laser and optical experiments with the Laser-Wave Explorer
              system.  LASERMIND plans to develop a teacher's guide and student workbook and
              to conduct field tests to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the
              prototype.

During the 1996-2006 period, science and engineering jobs are
              expected to increase by 44 percent.  Advances in laser technology will continue
              to generate a demand for skilled workers.  There exists a widening workforce
              gap between the number of skilled scientists and engineers that will be needed
              and those that are available.  The Laser Wave Explorer will decrease the
              workforce gap by preparing physics students for future science and technology
