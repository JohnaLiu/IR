Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project addresses the
              carbothermic reduction of MgO using natural gas as the carbon source to form
              magnesium metal powder.  The reduction of MgO with natural gas has been used in
              the past.  However, the inability to quench the reaction products sufficiently
              rapidly reduced the yield to less than an economically acceptable level. 
              Recently MIT, utilizing natural gas, showed yields as high as 90% in a small
              system.  Although more heat is required when using CH4 for reduction, the
              byproducts CO and H2 have great value.  The Plasma Quench process has quench
              rates of over a billion degrees C per second, and as a result, ITT believes
              that the yield could be close to 100% in a rapid plasma quench reactor system. 
              The key technical objective is to determine whether the fundamental quench
              approach will in fact completely prevent back reaction between the magnesium
              vapor and the carbon monoxide by-product.  The secondary objective is to
              determine the residence time that would be necessary for complete reaction. 
              Most of the required equipment exists to test the concept.  This includes a
              plasma torch reactor system, a feed system, and a collection system for fine
              powder.
