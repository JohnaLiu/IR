Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop all-metal
              support electronics that are based on giant magnetoresistance (GMR) for a
              nanoscale, nonvolatile, solid-state random-access memory.  Silicon technology,
              alone or in combination with GMR memory elements, cannot match either the
              density or low cost of all-metal memory because of inherent limits on scaling
              of semiconductors and because of the fewer masking steps required for all-metal
              technology.  Only all-metal solid-state storage (the combination of GMR memory
              and GMR circuitry) can realize the full potential of magnetoelectronic chips. 
              At the heart of the proposal's general-purpose electronics is a novel
              multifunctional GMR device called a transpinnor (TM).  The research objectives
              are to develop and demonstrate transpinnor-based circuitry on the all-metal
              chip.  The research will design the GMR elements, model and simulate their
              coupling on the circuit, fabricate and test GMR based selection and sense
              circuitry, and design a complete 1 Kbit all-metal magnetic memory chip. The
              results are anticipated to demonstrate functionality of GMR circuitry on an
              integrated chip.

The addressable markets for all-metal solid-state chips
              include not only semiconductor memories such as SRAM, DRAM and Flash, but
              mechanical storage and general-purpose electronics as well.
