Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
              high throughput multiple mRNA assay for screening large numbers of compounds to
              discover  potential compounds that affect patterns of gene expression in plant
              tissue.  The expression for a group of genes of interest and control genes can
              be tested all at once within each well of a 96-well plate.  Investigators can
              evaluate how 96 different compounds affect the expression pattern for these
              genes in each plate.  This technology will address an unmet need of the
              agricultural industry - to make efficient use of novel genomics information.
              This will allow testing of more gene targets including newly identified genes,
              and will provide information about selectivity and specificity.
Proprietary
              methods allow DNA array technology to be used for the high throughput multiple
              mRNA assay. Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of these methods
              using mammalian cells.  DNA arrays can be applied within each well and retain
              hybridization specificity.  The method is sensitive enough to detect genes
              expressed at one mRNA molecule per cell from cells grown within one well of a
              96-well plate.  The researchers propose to apply the approach to cultured plant
              cells, in order to form a reliable and sensitive screening technology for
              discovering new compounds that modulate gene expression in crops.
