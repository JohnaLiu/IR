Abstract    :
                     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project aims to develop a
              low cost single optical photon imaging detector. This detector will support
              diagnostic systems needing rapidly acquired images obtained from ultra-low
              levels of light.  Examples include:  assays for bacterial and yeast
              contamination in fluids in the food, beverage, pharmaceutical and semiconductor
              industries; and clinical diagnostics for gene-specific activity screens.  Phase
              I of this project will demonstrate the device concept. Phase II will develop a
              manufacturing process to support mass production and will initiate the custom
              design of one or more instruments for specific assays.
      Offering a
              suitable detector for a fraction of the cost of current technologies will
              facilitate the widespread adoption and development of assays that are faster
              and more accurate than current common practices. Industries in the U.S. will
              benefit from increased quality and productivity in processes that depend on
              these assays, and companies that produce the assays will enjoy growth in the
              demand for their products.
