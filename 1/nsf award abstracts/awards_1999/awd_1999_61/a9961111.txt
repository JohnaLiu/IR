Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project is directed towards
              developing a compact, unattended sensing module for shipboard or moored use, to
              measure the carbon dioxide concentration (pCO2) of the surface ocean. There
              remains large scientific uncertainty in the quantitative evaluation of the
              ocean as a sink for anthropogenically produced (excess) carbon dioxide
              emissions, a leading greenhouse gas (U.S. GCRP, 1999). At present, despite
              significant large scale programs such as the NSF and DOE supported JGOFS and
              WOCE studies of the past decade, the observational oceanographic database is
              limited in space and time. Current research ship based measurements obtained by
              discrete water sampling techniques are expensive, require highly skilled
              scientific personnel and are necessarily limited in their spatiotemporal
              resolution. The sensor system proposed here is needed to allow largely
              unattended deployment on a range of at-sea platforms, to greatly extend the
              global monitoring effort. 

Potential Commercial Applications of the
              Research. While the measurement of oceanic carbonate systems parameters has
              been regarded as a governmental agency or academic research concern, societal
              and socio-economic factors (e.g. the recent Kyoto Protocol) place great current
              value on their understanding by an increasing range of environmental agencies
              and oceanographic researchers both nationally and internationally.
              Demonstration of an accurate, compact pCO2 sensor will broaden the commercial
              market for this critical environmental measurement.
