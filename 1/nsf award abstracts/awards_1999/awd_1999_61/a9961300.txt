Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes an interactive
              education program with the International Space Station under the management of
              Durham Research, Inc.  The Telescience Resource Kit (TReK), a software and
              hardware package developed at NASA Marshall with the help of AZ Technology, has
              the potential to be a bridge between research and education.  This technology
              was originally developed to allow researchers to access payloads on-board the
              International Space Station from their laboratories and offices.  A web-based
              add-on component called TOPS was developed and the idea of using the system as
              an educational tool was born.  TOPS (Teleoperations System) is a Sun Java
              Studio-based visual program that was designed to be easily learned and
              manipulated by individuals with little or no computer skills.  A pilot program
              at Crofton Middle School in Maryland is being developed and research at the
              University of Alabama-Birmingham is being built into the eighth grade
              curriculum to meet Maryland State guidelines. Expansion of the program to
              interested schools will follow upon completion of the pilot program.

              Research proffers technology that will allow students to access payloads on the
              Space Station in real-time over the Internet and to perform actual research
              alongside professional researchers from around the world.  This kind of
              connection between student work in the classroom and on-going space station
              research has the potential to have a strong positive effect on student interest
              in, enthusiasm for, and understanding of science.  As the students conduct
              their own experiments, they will be reinforced by news from the space station. 
              The results of this work can provide a model for other efforts to connect the
              world of students with those of scientists.
