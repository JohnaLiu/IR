Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop an
              instrumentation system capable of characterizing the surface area and surface
              pore size distribution of coatings without the need for removing the coating
              from its substrate or using specific deposition substrates.  Current state of
              the art instrumentation is incapable of accurately characterizing the surface
              and pore size distributions of deposited coatings.  The proposed instrument
              would provide enabling technology for the characterization of coatings and
              surfaces.

The proposed surface characterization instrument represents a
              breakthrough capability for manufacturers and users of advanced coatings and
              membranes.  Instead of relying on time-consuming empirical trials of large
              volumes of prototype material, rapid determination of surface area and pore
              size distribution will be possible with cost-effective small samples.

The
              coatings and membrane industries represent markets exceeding $4 billion in the
              next decade.  Instrumentation that would enable industry to accurately, quickly
              and inexpensively characterize the vital surface features of coatings and
              membranes will be widely applicable for quality control of devices.  This
              instrument system is applicable, but not limited, to semiconductor processing,
              membrane development, optical coatings and pharmaceutical and medical products.
