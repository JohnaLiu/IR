Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
              subnanosecond switching spin dependent tunneling (SDT) devices by combining
              high speed magnetic thin films and low-capacitance SDT structures.  SDT devices
              have high signal, low switching field, and high resistance, which lead to high
              sensitivity, low power consumption, and small size and weight, when compared
              with giant magnetoresistive (GMR) materials.  While the switching speed of SDT
              devices is limited to longer than severalnanoseconds, the speed of fast
              electronics has gone into the deep sub-nanosecond regime in the past several
              years.  In order to make fast SDT devices, the magnetic material used in the
              devices has to be significantly reduced, and existing attractive static
              properties have to be maintained.  Phase I will address both film switching and
              SDT structure/design issues.  By incorporating high-speed magnetic films into
              the new SDT structures with fast electrical characteristics, the result is
              expected to be integrated SDT devices with state-of-the-art static properties,
              but with switching speeds of much less than 1 nanosecond.

There are several
              commercial applications for this technology in high-speed magnetic field and
              current sensing devices, high-speed/low-power isolaters, fast magnetic random
              access memories (MRAM), next generation read heads, as well as gigahertz
              inductor/transformer applications.
