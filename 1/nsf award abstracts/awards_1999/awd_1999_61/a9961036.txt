Abstract    :
              Electrical performance of ultracapacitors based on consolidated powders such as
              carbon powders is often limited by interparticle electrical resistance.  As a
              consequence, this requires the addition of conductivity enhancing additives or
              specialized processing steps. Transition metal carbide/nitride are known for
              their intrinsic high electronic conductance. To reduce the interparticle
              resistance, in this Phase I program, we are going to make transition metal
              carbide/nitride fiber electrodes using sol-gel technology.  The microstructure
              of fibers will be tailored to obtain a uniform pore size distribution and high
              accessible surface area.  The resulting power density of an ultracapacitor made
              of this material is expected to be notably impoved due to a much lower
              eqivalent series resistance (ESR).

Anticipated Benefits/Potential Commercial
              Applications of the Research or Developement Load leveling for electric vehicle
              or as power source for automotive sub-systems such as starter, regenerative
              braking and air bag. In addition, portable electronic devices such as notebook
              computers, cellular phones will also be able to use it as primary or secondary
              power sources.
