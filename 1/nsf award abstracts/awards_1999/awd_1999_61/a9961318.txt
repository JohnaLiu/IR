Abstract    :
              As the number of fish in rivers and streams diminishes and become threatened,
              endangered, or extinct, we see a growing concern from the local communities
              that is being met with increased funding and political attention. There is a
              need for better fish monitoring tools for the riverine environment. Leaders in
              the riverine sonar community have identified several deficiencies in current
              systems. Scientific Fishery Systems, Inc.
proposes to develop a broadband
              sonar fish tracking system for use in shallow water environments. The proposed
              system will address many of the current deficiencies, resulting in a broadband
              fish tracking system with 10 times better range resolution and at least 6 dB
              improvement in the signal to noise ratio for targets.  EPA estimates that there
              are 68,000 dams. The National Park Service estimates that thereare 75,000 dams.
              The Wall Street Journal estimates that there are 80,000 dams. The problems of
              tracking fish in three dimensions near dams to determine fish behavior is a
              major issue for many of these dams, especially those in the Columbia River
              Basin where the threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead have recently
              received the attention of the Office of the President.  Assuming only 5% of
              these dams require fish monitoring, and that SciFish is able to capture only
              10% of that market, this conservatively represents a $34 M market.
