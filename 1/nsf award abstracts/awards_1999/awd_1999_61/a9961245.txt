Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design,
              fabricate, and test novel, high-temperature pressure-sensing elements composed
              of shape memory alloys.  Ever-increasing demands on material systems under
              conditions of high temperatures and harsh environments create needs for high
              performance, low cost, reliable pressure transducers.  The sensing element will
              be suitable for a wide range of environments along with an ability to provide
              greater sensitivity than silicon carbide sensors.  Phase I will evaluate
              several candidate shape memory alloy materials and design a packaging scheme to
              maximize the sensitivity of this novel transducer.  Emphasis will be placed on
              exploiting property changes during phase transformations.

A high temperature
              pressure transducer is expected to have large impact in the automotive industry
              as an in-cylinder pressure sensor.  Furthermore, other industries such as
              geothermal drilling, industrial applications, and aircraft turbine engines will
              benefit from in-situ, high sensitivity pressure measurements.  The
              high-temperature pressure transducer would provide more than a three-fold
              increase in the maximum operating temperature and an order-of- magnitude
              increase in sensitivity over traditional pressure transducers.
