Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I program will determine the
              feasibility of actively controlling the spectral properties of Bragg gratings
              embedded in nonlinear optical waveguide devices.  The key innovation in this
              work is the application of an external field to control the embedded Bragg
              grating.  Preliminary calculations indicate that tuning ranges of 1 nm should
              be possible with rates as high as 10GHz.  To fully realize the potential of the
              electro-optically controlled Bragg grating, an investigation of the effect that
              different processing conditions have on the spectral properties of the grating
              will be made.  The ability to incorporate an electro-optically tunable Bragg
              grating with a particular set of spectral characteristics into a standard
              nonlinear optical material such as ion-modified potassium titanyl phosphate
              will greatly expand the functionality of the material and enable a broad range
              of new applications.

An electro-optically tunable Bragg grating will open
              the door to a broad range of applications, including direct high speed
              frequency modulation of diode lasers for wavelength division multiplexing
              (WDM), spectroscopy, and remote s
