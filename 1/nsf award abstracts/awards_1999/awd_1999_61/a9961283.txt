Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves
              conventional endoscopes that have limited field-of-view (FOV). They observe
              objects through a relatively small solid angle subtended in front of the distal
              end of the scope.  Although various prisms can be used in the optical design to
              change the viewing direction, a wide FOV observation can not be achieved
              without adjusting the optical system, employing moving parts, or turning the
              endoscope itself.  Furthermore, the panoramic view can not be acquired
              simultaneously. 
For many medical diagnosis instrument (gastroscope,
              cystoscope, colonscope,etc.) and industrial inspections (pipe inspection,
              turbine engine diagnosis, surveillance, autonomous navigation, security,
              robotics, video conferencing, etc), simultaneously acquired image in all
              directions around the sensor system can provide invaluable visual information
              and a leapfrog advance in the performance of these systems.  The primary
              
objective of the SBIR effort proposed herein is to investigate the
              feasibility of a novel endoscope design, dubbed as the 'Omniscope', based on
              the omnidirectional imaging technique recently developed by Genex Technologies,
              Inc.  The proposed design allows an ultra wide viewing angle (360 degree) and
              simultaneous observing capability, therefore can greatly increase the
              efficiency, accuracy, and patient's comfort in diagnosis and treatment.  The
              Omniscope technique will also provide a unique tool for documentation,
              
surgery planning, and training.  Due to its simple structural and optical
              design, the Omniscope can be fabricated inexpensively and will be reliable in
              practical field usage environment.
