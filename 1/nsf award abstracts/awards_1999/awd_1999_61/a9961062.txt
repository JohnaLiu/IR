Abstract    :
              A new conductive composite material is proposed for use in fuel cells as a
              bipolar plate between adjoining cells in series.  The new composite material is
              lightweight and promises to reduce manufacturing time and costs associated with
              incorporating complex field flow channels into the plate surface.  The
              conductive material consists of polybutylene terephthalate thermoplastic
              embedded with carbon nanotubes, which are 10x100 Angstroms in size.  The
              material will be processed to reduce pellets to a powder for compression
              molding, extrusion and injection molding trials.  Processing and manufacturing
              methods for the composite will be optimized to produce thin plates for testing.
               The effects of incorporating plasticizers and coupling agents on the material
              processing will be investigated.  Physical and mechanical properties of the
              molded composite will be determined including gas permeability, tensile and
              flexural strength, thermal expansion coefficient, resistivity and contact
              resistance against other cell components.  The plates will be tested in a
              proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and the electrochemical performance
              compared with cells containing plates made of graphite and other composites. 
              The effects of service use at 80oC will be assessed by re-establishing the
              physical and mechanical characteristics after continuous cell operation.
