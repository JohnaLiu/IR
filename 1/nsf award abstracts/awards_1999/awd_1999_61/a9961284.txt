Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has as its primary
              objective to develop a fully automatic and intelligent software tool that is
              able to mosaic (i.e., align and merge) multiple 3D images of the same object
              taken from different viewpoints, without a priori knowledge of camera
              positions. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling of physical objects and environment
              is an essential part of the challenges for many multimedia tasks. However, most
              physical objects self occlude, and no single view 3D image suffices to describe
              the entire surface of a 3D object.  Multiple 3D images of the same object or
              scene from various viewpoints have to be taken and integrated in order to
              obtain a complete 3D model of the 3D object or scene. We call this process the
              '3D mosaic'. The main innovations of this proposed effort are threefold:

1.
              an intelligent alignment method that is able to register multiple uncalibrated
              3D images without needing a priori knowledge of camera location and
              orientation;

2. a seamless merge method to 'stitch' together the aligned 3D
              images using the fuzzy logic principle; and

3. an intelligent 3D image
              compression algorithm that preserves 3D image geometric features while
              achieving high compression ratio.

The 3D Mosaic technique to be developed
              has enormous commercial applications, including industrial design and
              prototyping, reverse engineering, manufacturing part inspection, part
              replacement and repair, animation, entertainment, 3D modeling for WWW
              documents, archiving, virtual reality environment, education, virtual museum,
              commercial on-line catalogues, etc.  If successful, 1t could become an
              important part of future 3D TV technology.
