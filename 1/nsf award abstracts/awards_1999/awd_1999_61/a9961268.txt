Abstract    :
                      This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project aims to
              demonstrate the feasibility, through physical experimentation at small scale,
              of using newly developed and very promising long-gage fiber-optic sensors,
              fiber Bragg grating sensors, for monitoring directly the 'macroscopic' internal
              deformation response of structures to strong ground motions and for
              non-destructive post-earthquake evaluation of structures. These sensors can be
              demodulated at high speeds (kHz to MHz) to accurately monitor dynamic events
              and to provide oversampling capabilities. Determination of the actual nonlinear
              inelastic response mechanisms developed by civil structures such as buildings
              and bridges during strong earthquakes and post-earthquake damage assessment of
              these structures represent very difficult challenges for earthquake structural
              engineers. Indeed, the ultimate objective of the whole research effort in
              modeling and analysis of structural response to earthquake ground motions is to
              predict the actual seismic response of structures with all its key features.
 
                   Applications include earthquake damage assessment of buildings and civil
              structures. Capability to correct current unbalance between the analytical
              capabilities for predicting nonlinear structural response and damage parameters
              and the incompleteness of the information on the actual seismic response of
              structures measured in the laboratory and in the field.
