Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              closed-loop solvent evaporation ovens.  Currently, industrial processes pass
              large.volumes of heated air through the evaporation oven, producing an air
              stream effluent contaminated by volatile organic carbon (VOC) compounds.  These
              present environmental problems and no opportunity for recovery of the solvent. 
              The proposed process is an enclosed, closed-loop system using nitrogen as the
              recirculating gas and a membrane to recover the evaporated solvent vapors and
              remove oxygen and water vapor derived from air that leaks into the gas.  The
              amount of make-up nitrogen required will be small.  Operating costs would be
              justified by the avoided costs of treating the dilute VOC-contaminated air
              stream and by the value of the recovered solvent.  The main Phase I
              experimental task involves a selection of an oxygen-permeable, solvent
              vapor/nitrogen-impermeable membrane for the oxygen removal step.  The membrane
              must retain these properties at high solvent vapor pressures and high feed gas
              temperatures.  A prototype of the system will also be designed and the
              construction costs estimated.  Phase II will build a complete system and
              operate it in the laboratory and at cooperating host sites to evaluate process
              benefits and costs.

Replacement of direct-air-vented solvent evaporation
              ovens with affordable closed-loop nitrogen recirculation systems would become
              feasible for use in tablet coating and printing operations, preparation of
              tapes and adhesive films, and surface coating, varnishing, and painting
              operations common in industry.  The new oven systems will allow solvent
              recovery and reuse, eliminate troublesome vapor emissiona, and offer many
              processing advantages.  Affordable systems based on this technology are
              expected to be widely used.
