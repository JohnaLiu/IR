Abstract    :
              This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project aims to develop an
              instrument to accurately characterize the thermal (T) and/or temporal (t)
              response of a material's specific volume (Vsp). Presently, no commercially
              available device exists for the characterization of Vsp (T, t) at ambient
              pressures. The proposer's involvement in the design, development and validation
              of a stage I prototype device is what has led to the identification of gaps
              within the existing technology. The proposed development of this next
              generation instrumentation was made possible through the implementation of a
              fiber-optic displacement sensor system developed by the proposer. This is due
              in part, to a constant influx of new engineering materials to the market place
              (i.e. thermoplastics, thermosets, metal alloys, polymorphs of existing
              materials, etc.) and the emergence and/or growth of new and exciting fields
              (i.e. microelectronics, composite manufacturing, etc.). Ultimately, this need
              is driven by the fact that there are a variety of physical phenomena which
              result in dimensional change (i.e. crystallization, curing, melting, glass
              formation, secondary transitions and physical aging).

Specific applications
              for the fully developed and commercialized instrumentation include atmospheric
              pressure high-resolution volumetric dilatometry; and non-contact,
              nano-displacement metrology; as well as, linear dilatometry, non-contact,
              micro-displacement metrology and thin-film metrology.
