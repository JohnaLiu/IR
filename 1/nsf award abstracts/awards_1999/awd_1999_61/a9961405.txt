Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              theoretical models of three advanced heat pipe mechanisms that should lead to
              significantly improved heat flux capability.  The mechanisms include Combined
              Pulsating and Capillary Transport (CPCT), Star Wick Transport (SWT) and
              Subcooled Liquid Feeding (SLF) mechanisms.  The principal Phase I objective is
              to develop two basic models that later will be validated by experiments and
              incorporated into CPCT, SWT and SLF heat pipe design models in Phase II.  Two
              models, including a 1-D transient Pulsating Flow Heat Transfer model and a 3-D
              steady state Wick Nucleate Boiling model, will be numerically solved to provide
              a fundamental understanding of heat transfer and slow stability of thermally
              drive, pulsating two-phase flows in miniature channels and boiling heat
              transfer and two-phase flows in porous wick structures.  The Phase I results
              will include two theoretical models (mathematical and numerical formulations)
              and numerical solution packages (computer codes and numerical results).

The
              theoretical models developed through this program will benefit the design of
              the three advanced heat pipe mechanisms for potential application in markets
              such as high-end workstations, servers, notebook computers, and laser diodes
