Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research project will develop highly engineered,
              oxidation resistant and durable NZP-based TBCs for components in advanced
              aerospace and gas turbine engine systems.  Next generation aerospace propulsion
              and power generation systems have to meet requirements of higher efficiencies,
              greater fuel economy, and longer lifetimes.  Higher firing temperatures and
              better insulation are required to improve engine efficiency and lifetimes of
              components in such systems.  State-of-the art thermal barrier coatings (TBCs)
              based on yttria partially-stabilized zirconia (YPSZ) are inadequate to meet
              these temperature and lifetime requirements because of:(1) oxidation problems,
              (2) low thermo-chemical stability, (3) in-service microstructural changes, and
              (4) low strain tolerance. At least, two compositions viz. Ba1.25Zr4P5.5Si0.5O24
              (BS-25) and Ca0.5Sr0.5Zr4P6O24 (CS-50,) belonging to the NZP ceramics family,
              are ideally suited for advanced TBCs. Attractive properties of these
              compositions include high melting temperature (> 1800C), high thermal cycling
              stability, very low thermal conductivity (~1.0 W/mK), excellent thermal shock
              resistance, and low oxygen ion conductivity.  In addition, their thermal
              expansion coefficients are very low.  Functionally Graded (FG) design approach
              will be used to minimize thermal expansion mismatches and introduce beneficial
              surface compressive stresses.  When successfully developed, this technology
              will also be beneficial to automotive and metallurgical industries.

Specific
              commercial applications that could be immediately realized for NZP
              ceramics-based TBCs are: for turbine blades, combustor liners, stator vanes,
              etc., in jet and gas turbine engines; and pistons, valve heads, exhaust port,
              and cylinders in diesel engines. Other commercial applications are in: (1) Heat
              Exchangers, (2) Burner Nozzles, (3) Hot Gas Fans and Filters, and (4) Pump and
              Valve Linings in Corrosive Environments.
