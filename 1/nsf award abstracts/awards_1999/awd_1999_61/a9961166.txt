Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is designed to
              demonstrate the feasibility of building giant-magnetoresistive (GMR) bridge
              sensors that exhibit tenfold and greater improvement in hysteresis over
              existing bridge sensors.  Unique processing enables edge pinning in GMR
              sandwich resistor elements that leads to increased stability and significant
              reduction in hysteresis. Technical objectives required to develop the low
              hysteresis bridge sensors are:  (1) determine the edge hardening mechanism; (2)
              develop a single-step edge hardening process protocol; (3) develop a two-step
              edge hardening process protocol; (4) design sensor prototypes utilizing low
              hysteresis; and (5) build and characterize hard-edge bridge sensors.  The
              research will focus on first gaining an understanding and control of the hard
              edge treatment. This effort will produce a basic low hysteresis bridge sensor. 
              That knowledge will then be applied to processing variable degrees of hard edge
              profiles within a given device.  The result of this effort will be a
              self-biased full-output bride sensor and a fully symmetric bridge sensor.  In
              addition to addressing the need for low hysteresis in magnetic bridge sensors,
              the processes developed can be applied to integrated linear and digital output
              sensors and signal isolation devices.
