Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop the basis
              for miniaturization of Ion Cyclotron Resonance Fourier Transform Mass
              Spectrometry (ICR-FT-MS)instruments. This basis will be deployed in Phase II
              and Phase III to build and qualify such an instrument for industrial and
              commercial applications.  The proposed research concerns the characterization
              of an existing small and light superconducting solenoid and the numerical
              simulation of the relation between ion cyclotron resonance frequency and ion
              mass-to-charge ratio which undergoes distortion due to a number of effects that
              are included in the numerical simulation.  Such distortion becomes large when
              the magnitude of the magnetic field and the size of the ICR-FT-MS cell become
              small. A performance equivalent to a magnetic field of 1 T and a mass
              resolution in excess of 10,000 at a mass-to-charge-ratio of 100 g/mol is
              anticipated.  Although the performance of such small and light instruments will
              be much lower than that of large and heavy instruments, it will combine some of
              the performance of currently deployed non-ICR-FT-MS instruments into a
              versatile instrument that bridges the price and performance gap between
              non-ICR-FT-MS and ICR-FT-MS.  This is expected to result in a market potential
              of $5,000,000 per year.
