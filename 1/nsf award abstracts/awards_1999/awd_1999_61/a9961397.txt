Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will develop a silicon
              carbide (SiC) process technology that will permit control of both the
              microstructure and macrostructure during the SiC deposition process. This will
              be done by combining a rapid chemical vapor deposition technique using
              organosilicon sources combined  with a transfer mold technique.   Patterned and
              etched silicon substrates will be used as templates. This approach will enable
              the growth of three-dimensional SiC structures for advanced
              microelectromechanical structures (MEMS) and vacuum microelectronic (VME)
              devices with greater functionality and durability. This  microstructural
              engineering process, if successful,  will be applied to the  development of SiC
              components such as gyroscopes, heat engines, nozzles, and sensors for MEMS
              applications and flat panel displays and RF microwave amplifiers for harsh
              environments.
