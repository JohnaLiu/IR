Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)  Phase I project involves the
              introduction of advanced, automated modeling and verification techniques into
              the design cycle of reactive systems. The state of the art mandates the
              extensive use of testing in order to ensure that such systems, which typically
              function in safety- and business-critical settings, behave correctly.  The key
              insight underlying the innovation is that many errors, and much of the cost of
              testing and other design, development and maintenance activities, can be
              eliminated through the judicious use of rigorous modeling notations based on
              process algebra, and through model checking to examine the properties of such
              models.  The project will yield cost-effective techniques for producing
              reactive systems that are more dependable, cheaper to design, more thoroughly
              understood, better documented, and easier to maintain than those constructed
              using current practice.  The ubiquity of reactive systems, and the nation's
              increasing reliance on them point to the dramatic benefits the innovation will
              have on society's safety, security and economic well being.  

This
              technology, if successful can be used in the of dependable reactive systems
              such as the embedded software found in automotive, medical, aeronautical,
              consumer-electronic and telecommunications applications.
