This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will develop a novel electro-mechanical, micro-vibratory transducer that can be
              used to detect and control boundary layer flow separation in a wide class of
              aerodynamic flows.  This transducer is composed of a very thin, light-weight
              composite sheet that contains the combination sensors and vibratory transducers
              that are used to detect boundary layer flow conditions and to excite the
              viscous sub-layer of the boundary layer to control flow separation.  The power
              consumption of the transducer is expected to be about three orders of magnitude
              lower than the best competing technologies.  The device will be easily applied
              to or integrated into stationary and high-speed rotating machinery and
              components such as aircraft wings and control surfaces, aircraft propellers,
              helicopter rotors, axial compressor blades, diffusers, and nozzles.  Phase I
              will address wide needs for flow control in high-Reynolds Number flows. 

The
              performance enhancement and increased efficiency of such an advanced boundary
              layer control device can provide a competitive edge in many industries.  This
              technology can potentially be applied to a broad range of aviation needs
              including drag reduction, lift augmentation, and boosting of flight controls in
              airplanes and similar applications in helicopters.  Applications of the
              technology in the automotive field and in the process industry will also be
              pursued.
