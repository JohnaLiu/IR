Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project seeks to demonstrate
              the
feasibility of integrating vast numbers of microfluidic channels with Spin
              Dependent
Tunneling (SDT) sensors on a chip. These sensors will detect flow of
              nanoscopic
superparamagnetic particles of the type typically used for
              separations and as labels in
bioassays. The immediate goal is to demonstrate
              and evaluate particle detection in single
channels. Ultimately, the proposed
              work could lead to a biochip with 1000 parallel
microchannels, each able to
              detect the passing of single superparamagnetic particles at
the rate of 1000 /
              second: a total detection rate of 1,000,000 particles / second! The
SDT
              sensors enable this high capacity because they can be fabricated in sub-micron
              sized
elements, integrated with standard silicon integrated circuits, and
              combined with typical
MEMS and microfluidic structures. They are the latest
              and most sensitive sensors in the
class of ferromagnetic thin film materials
              including Anisotropic Magnetoresistance (AMR)
and Giant Magnetoresistance
              (GMR).  This new biochip tool may have significant utility 
for detection of
              cells, proteins, biological pathogens, pollutants in fluids, and
              performing
DNA analyses.
