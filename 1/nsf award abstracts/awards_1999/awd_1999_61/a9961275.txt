Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new understanding of rolling mill chatter.  Rolling mill chatter is a vibration
              problem limiting the throughput of nearly all metal rolling operations.  In
              addition, associated sensitivities of the system to external vibration forces
              necessitate costly maintenance programs to minimize these forces.  The root
              cause of the problem is a destabilizing feedback mechanism, which renders the
              system extremely sensitive to any excitation.  In the limit, the rolling
              process is unstable and self excited.  The extension/tension relationship of
              the interstand steel sheet is a critical component of the feedback path.  Phase
              I will explore previously overlooked aspects of sheet behavior to modify the
              feedback control path such that the feedback is a stabilizing rather than
              destabilizing effect.

This technology has wide potential application to hot
              and cold rolling processes in the steel industry, aluminum industry, tin mills,
              finishing mills, and plastics processing.
