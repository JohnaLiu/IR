Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate that a
              fully functional internet seismic processing system (INSP) can be developed and
              smoothly operated.  The use of large-scale parallel computers for seismic
              processing has achieved such technical and economical success that the oil and
              gas industry is the largest commercial market for scientific high-performance
              computing; however, the vast majority of exploration organizations have no
              direct access to high-end seismic imaging technologies because they lack the
              resources to acquire and maintain the necessary hardware and software.  The
              objective of this project is to take advantage of high-speed networks and
              recent advances in architecture-independent programming languages to provide a
              seamless internet/intranet seismic computing solution.  The research will
              attempt to build the software infrastructure that will enable geologists to
              have direct control of depth-imaging projects and to have access to remote
              large-scale parallel computers, as effortlessly and effectively as if they were
              employing a workstation linked to their local-area network. This will overcome
              the economical and operational obstacles that today prevent the vast majority
              of exploration projects in difficult areas to fully benefit from the rapid
              progress in high-performance computing.

The commercial potential of the
              technology is significant because it makes seismic depth imaging and other
              compute-intensive technologies accessible to a large heretofore untapped client
              base, while providing an efficient resource distribution and allocation to all
              potential clients requiring access to high performance computing facilities and
              state-of-the-art software.  The resulting product will allow greatly increased
              interaction between the client and contractor, thereby increasing the quality
              of the final seismic image and in turn reducing exploration risk and offsetting
              the high costs of exploratory drilling and failed reservoir management
              projects.
