This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project  will explore the feasibility of a low-cost, microfabrication system
              known as micro cross-sectional lithography.  The system would be capable of
              creating high aspect ratio, three dimensional micromechanical devices for
              Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) applications with a one-micron
              resolution from photopolymer resins, typically using UV energy.  Phase I will
              include fabrication of a demonstration unit with 5-micron resolution, design of
              a one-micron resolution lens for feasibility analysis, and materials evaluation
              for microscale properties.

The experimental design suggests increased
              resolution, increased flexibility in manufacturing, reduced cost, and reduced
              fabrication times compared to current lithographic means.  Use of such a device
              enhances the capability of designers and researchers by allowing cost-effective
              prototypes to be built at the microscale level.  This innovative process will
              greatly enhance the ability to package microsensors and improve on parts
              designs through the prototyping process.
