Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project states that the use of
              autologous  hematopoietic stem cell  (HSC) transplantation is increasing for
              treatment of many cancers.   However, tumor  cell contamination within
              harvested HSC products continues to be of major concern.  Contaminating tumor
              cells are known to contribute to cancer relapse, based on studies using
              genetically-marked transplanted cells. Several purging methods have been
              developed, but all leave detectable tumor cells in the transplant. Furthermore,
               existing methods reduce HSC numbers, compromising the therapeutic value of
              purging.   Therefore, technology that reliably eliminates detectable tumor
              cells from a transplant, while leaving HSCs undamaged, is needed. This proposal
              describes a patented innovative approach integrating fluorescence scanning
              cytometry, real-time image analysis, and laser ablation. Phase I studies are
              proposed to evaluate feasibility of an approach that
 would accelerate the
              process to the speed required for clinical-scale operation.  A breadboard
              optical system will be assembled and tested for rapid scanning and
              identification of fluorescent targets. Successful Phase I results will lead to
              Phase II studies to fully develop the prototype instrument and initiate
              clinical trials.  This will lead to commercialization of a method to eliminate
              tumor cells from an HSC transplant within a several hour automated procedure. 
              Over 30,000 autologous HSC transplants were performed in 1997, and the number
              is increasing 20-25% per year. The resulting instrumentation is applicable to
              any process that requires a highly defined cell product.
