Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project focuses on the
              innovative use of microspheres to provide substantially long pathlengths for
              spectrum analysis.  Microspheres are spheres of optical material 100 um or less
              in diameter. They have the ability to propagate light around their equatorial
              diameter. Light can be coupled in and out of the microsphere. In this way, a
              microsphere can serve as the light chamber for spectral analysis, offering a
              meters-long path length in a very small volume. This will allow the
              construction of accurate optical spectrum analyzers in a small, robust package.
               Typical spectrum analyzers are delicate laboratory instruments that do not
              support field use. Furthermore, the ultra-narrow channel spacing being planned
              for optical networks will exceed the currently available range capabilities of
              optical spectrum analyzers. The proposed device will be relatively inexpensive,
              easy to integrate into new and existing fiber networks, and rugged enough to
              survive field deployments. Telecommunications service providers need field
              monitoring equipment to prevent system shutdowns, and the best tool for that
              job is an optical spectrum analyzer. The proposed device would provide that
              capability with better accuracy, at a lower cost, and in a package capable of
              continuous use in the field.
