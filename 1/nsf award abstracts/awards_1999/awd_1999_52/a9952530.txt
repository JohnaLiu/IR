Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

This project is creating a library collection of
              "interactive explorations" to support a suite of undergraduate courses in
              mathematics. Each exploration consists of approximately eight organized
              sequences of simulations, "quantitative/qualitative laboratory" experiments,
              lessons, and/or open-ended exercises tied to the conceptual themes of the
              targeted course. The underlying application programming package is the
              Mathwright software environment created originally at the IBM Institute for
              Academic Technology at the University of North Carolina. Development of these
              explorations is by faculty teams that pair a novice developer and an
              experienced author of Mathwright WorkBooks. A particularly attractive "capacity
              building" feature of this project is that the novice developers represent HBCU
              institutions. The project leverages a large collection of existing WorkBooks by
              employing a new "translator" software application that converts WorkBooks to
              the Java programming language. This tool also enhances the dissemination and
              ultimate usability of newly created material. Extensive class testing of the
              explorations is taking place at the eight participating HBCU institutions, and
              it is expected that the course improvements form part of a larger effort of
              curricular reform.
