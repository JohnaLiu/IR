Abstract    :
              Chemistry  (12)
Use of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) for
              undergraduate instruction and research and adaptation of experiments published
              in various journals allow widespread use of sophisticated instrumentation in
              introductory and advanced level undergraduate chemistry courses. The project is
              one part of an overall curriculum modernization plan the goal of which is to
              provide students with more hands-on experience using modern instrumentation and
              to incorporate additional laboratory exercises that more fully engage students
              in the scientific process and exploration of scientific concepts. GC/MS is
              being integrated into a new honors freshman chemistry sequence, into
              sophomore-level organic and analytical chemistry courses, and into
              upper-division physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, and organic
              spectroscopy courses. GC/MS based laboratory exercises from standard literature
              are being adapted for use in target courses, and new laboratory modules are
              being developed, including a novel collaborative exercise between students
              enrolled in two different courses. A central theme in the proposed
              instructional applications is the incorporation of open-ended, discovery-based
              labs. The GC/MS also receives widespread use in faculty directed undergraduate
              research projects, particularly in the area of organic chemistry.
