Abstract    :
              PROJECT SUMMARY

The Science, Engineering and Educator Intelligent Tutor
              (SEE-IT) project is developing an intelligent tutor for an introductory
              sequence in electrical circuits and systems, but the program could be used in
              any discipline.  The paradigm adopted is that of a newly hired engineer working
              in an office with access to a laboratory.

The project is: 1) Developing and
              integrating the components of an interactive multimedia intelligent tutoring
              system to supplement a two semester introductory course on electric circuits
              for electrical engineering undergraduates, and a two semester course in
              electric circuits and systems for engineering students not majoring in
              electrical engineering. 2) Developing a realistic laboratory that enables
              students to select, place and interconnect circuit elements, electronic
              devices, electrical systems, signal generators and measuring instruments.  3)
              Providing students with an intelligent laboratory assistant that acts as a
              laboratory technician. 4) Preparing a subset of the modules for high school
              mathematics and science teachers that will enable them to introduce
              introductory engineering concepts in their classrooms. 5) Evaluating the
              effectiveness of the intelligent tutoring system and describing its affect on
              student learning.  6) Placing the resultant SEE-IT modules on CD ROM, and
              making these modules completely functional on the world wide web. 7)
              Disseminating the results over the world wide web, in appropriate journals, and
              through presentations at notable conferences.
