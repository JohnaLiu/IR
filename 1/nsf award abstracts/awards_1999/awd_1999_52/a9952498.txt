Abstract    :
              Physics (13)  A "Physics Exploration Center" (PEC) to supplement
              lecture-oriented teaching in large introductory physics courses has been
              designed. At the PEC, physics lecture demonstrations are turned into fun
              activities that are integrated with the introductory courses. The PEC has been
              tried on a small scale, and this project is expanding it so that it can serve
              large numbers of students. The central objective of PEC is to provide students
              an opportunity for hands-on, demonstration-based homework problems. The PEC
              experience is different from that of a traditional laboratory, and is meant to
              be more conceptual and open-ended. The primary purpose is to help students with
              conceptual understanding of the lecture material, challenge their
              preconceptions by providing contradictory experiences, and introduce them to
              scientific method. PEC activities can be particularly beneficial for the
              intellectual development of underprepared students.
