Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)This project is introducing the use of a state-of-the-art
              inductively coupled 
plasma - optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) as part
              of an interdisciplinary effort to incorporate analytical chemistry techniques
              into the earth sciences curriculum. Students in several departments access the
              equipment, including those in geology, chemistry, and environmental studies
              programs. The introduction of these new analytical techniques complements an
              existing hands-on field-oriented approach in the earth and environmental
              sciences. Student research opportunities are also being supported, and access
              to the instrumentation is shared with other institutions with which W&L has had
              previous collaborative agreements, including members of the Keck Geology
              Consortium. Materials and approaches from several institutions are being
              adapted and/or implemented including an environmental program at Duquesne
              University that emphasizes atomic spectroscopic techniques, problem-based class
              and laboratory approaches developed by a Dept. of Chemistry team at Bates
              College with NSF/DUE funding in the ILI and CCLI programs (#9950314 and
              #9850730), and multi-element analyses approaches in mineralogy and petrology
              developed by members of the Dept. of Earth Science at Minot State (NSF
              #9751439).
