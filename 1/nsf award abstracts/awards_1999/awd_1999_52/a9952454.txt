Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31) This project develops a laboratory for studying
              administrative aspects of computer networking and operating systems. The
              laboratory includes mini-networks of PC workstations and servers, plus Ethernet
              hubs, routers, and an Ethernet/ATM switch for connectivity. The project adapts
              materials developed through NSF Award 9750885 to the University of Michigan. 
              This project adapts the materials to use the Linux rather than NT operating
              system and increases the emphasis on measurement and experimentation.

The
              laboratory allows students to install and manage a network of PCs, program
              routers both for normal use and as packet-filtering firewalls, and to measure
              network performance of different technologies. Prior to this project, students
              at Rockhurst did not get any experience in these areas  since all of the
              College's networking resources were used for essential infrastructure and were
              unavailable for experimentation.

The laboratory will be integrated into two
              regularly offered courses in networking and operating systems. Many of the
              adapted and newly developed exercises will also be used as supplemental
              materials in three other courses. The project director will host two one week
              summer workshops for faculty development.  All developed materials will be
              available through courseware repositories on the Web and results will be
              presented at computer science education conferences.
