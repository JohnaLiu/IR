Abstract    :
              Economics (82)
Patterns in Problem Solving is multimedia software designed to
              teach problem solving strategies in economics. Classroom integration of
              instruction on problem solving and standard course material requires a costly
              tradeoff between quality of learning and the amount of material that can be
              covered. This project develops software that allows problem solving strategies
              and new economic knowledge to be taught on parallel but separate tracks.
              Separation through computer-assisted instruction is expected to increase
              learning by allowing students to distinguish those study methods pertinent to
              problem solving from those that are appropriate for new economic knowledge. The
              objective of Patterns in Problem Solving is to develop problem-solving
              strategies within the domain of economics and (later on) to transfer these
              strategies to a variety of domains. The software use multi-level questions to
              guide students through fifty application problems. The problems are based on a
              subset of core economic knowledge but the software does not teach economics per
              se. The software develops proficiency in ten problem-solving strategies adapted
              from research on the differences between expert and novice problem
              solvers.
