Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) This proof of concept project integrates technology
              into genetics instruction and amplifies faculty effectiveness by providing a
              better learning environment for students. Interactive, highly visual
              computer-based tools include tutorials for problem solving, the use of
              simulated crosses to generate data, and assessments of conceptual knowledge
              through 2D mapping exercises. The project brings together content experts with
              artists and student developers in an authoring team to create these tools. The
              product provides the basis for assessing and evaluating knowledge transfer
              between different subjects or classes in genetics. The expected immediate
              audience is approximately 1700 students per year in the University of
              California at Los Angeles Introductory Genetics class, plus an additional 300
              students at the University of California at Santan Barbara and students at two
              year community colleges in the Los Angeles area with articulated programs. The
              long-term audience will be students in genetics classes nationwide. The final
              project planned is a CD-ROM web hybrid for distribution to students for
              independent study and discussion section cooperative exercises.
