Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)

A student-focussed, guided inquiry approach to
              teaching concepts of molecular structure and function is being developed using
              accurate, three dimensional physical models of protein structure.  The physical
              models provide students with a solid base upon which to construct their
              knowledge of the molecular world.  This approach is being tested both in
              long-standing introductory biology and chemistry courses, where these models
              and accompanying computer visualization tools will be used to complement and
              extend existing courses, and in a new upper level biochemistry course
              specifically designed around this pedagogical approach.  The pedagogical model
              employed enables students to discover and construct their own knowledge by
              relating abstract concepts as much as possible to real world examples. Students
              use the physical model to translate the abstract concept of a protein into
              something tangible and tactilely significant.  Students then formulate their
              own questions regarding the structure and functional features of a model
              protein and, in a guided but open-ended laboratory experience, explore the
              answers to their questions.
