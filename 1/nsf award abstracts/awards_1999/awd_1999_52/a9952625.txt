Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

This project is developing, implementing,
              evaluating, and disseminating a two course sequence in scientific simulation.
              This sequence involves modeling, numerical analysis, and computer programming.
              The first purpose of the course is to teach students how to solve extended
              problems that require them to learn how to formulate the problem; decide on the
              appropriate mathematical tool; implement the method; obtain, interpret, and
              communicate the results; and use that information to refine the model. The
              second purpose is for students to learn how to implement modern technology in
              their problem solving techniques. The overall motivation for the course is that
              most real world problems are solved with the aid of technology and require
              these types of problem solving methodologies.

In this course students are
              learning the basics of numerical analysis, including Simpson's rule,
              Runge-Kutta methods, and finite difference models. The course also includes a
              discussion of object-oriented C++ programming and shows how computer objects
              can be used to simplify scientific programming. The primary focus of this
              multidisciplinary course is on simulations such as a swinging pendulum and
              catalyzed chemical reactions which can be taken from the sciences. The course
              is being adapted from the course "Experimental Mathematics" at Northwestern
              University.
