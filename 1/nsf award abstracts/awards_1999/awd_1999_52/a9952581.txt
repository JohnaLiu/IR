Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)

The overall project goals are to develop and compare
              two prototype modules for a science-based and technology-driven textile
              laboratory manual and accompanying visual media that integrate science
              principles, scientific methods, and evaluation of textile test
              results.

Existing instructional materials used for textile laboratory
              experiences and assignments do not integrate science principles into the
              laboratory curriculum, nor do they draw upon science principles in the
              explanations of lab results. An understanding of the fundamental relationship
              between the underlying science principles and the observed textile performance
              is critical to understanding science principles as explanations and predictors
              in future professional applications. These textile laboratory materials are
              integrating the teaching of science principles and scientific methods into
              laboratory instruction and are developing the students' use of science
              principles to explain observed lab outcomes.
