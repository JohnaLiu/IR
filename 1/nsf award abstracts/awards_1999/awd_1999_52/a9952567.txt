Abstract    :
              This builds on a previous project where a lack of geometric visualization in the
              student comprehension of three-dimensional concepts was discovered. With the
              help of mechanical engineering students from the school of engineering, a
              system and set of tools is being created. This set of tools is helping students
              of science and engineering visualize concepts relating to points, surfaces,
              curves, contours, and vectors in three dimensions.

The goals for the project
              are the following: 
(a) to manufacture sets of these tools, which can be used
              both by instructors and by students in small groups. 
(b) to publish an
              accompanying manual for the use of these tools. 
(c) to locate partner
              institutions to pilot test these tools.

To realize these goals, mechanical
              engineering students are refining tools currently being used to a level where
              they can be mass-produced. The senior personnel are writing the accompanying
              manual for their effective use. Local tests are being run to test their
              effectiveness. Partner institutions are being identified to help pilot test
              these tools.

This project is having a strong impact on underrepresented
              minorities in SEM fields. It involves faculty development and the integration
              of new tools in the mathematics curriculum.
