Abstract    :
              Astronomy (11) This project is developing a series of innovative classroom
              instructional materials for a large enrolment, introductory science survey
              course for non-science and pre-service education majors. The final materials
              package, called Lecture-Tutorials, is a self-contained, classroom-ready product
              for use with collaborative student learning groups. The materials are designed
              specifically to be easily integrated into the conventional lecture course. As
              such, this product directly addresses the needs of busy researchers and
              heavily-loaded teaching faculty for effective, student-centered,
              classroom-ready materials that do not require a drastic course revision for
              implementation. The Lecture-Tutorials developed for this project are based upon
              educational research on student misconceptions, demonstrated effective
              instructional strategies, and extensive pilot and field-testing. The
              materials-development procedure serves as a national model for other science
              disciplines that provide similar large-enrollment introductory courses. The
              project investigators are primarily disseminating these materials through
              workshops at professional science meetings in addition to making print and Web
              versions readily available.
