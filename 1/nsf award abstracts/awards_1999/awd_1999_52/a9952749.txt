Abstract    :
              Software Engineering (34)  This project adapts materials from six exemplary
              university programs along with an integrated suite of CASE and collaboration
              tools to the Hiram College environment. At Hiram College software engineering
              is distributed over several courses taken by both traditional computer science
              majors and weekend college computer systems management majors and minors (adult
              learners). It will directly affect approximately 50 undergraduate students per
              year.

The project creates a software engineering laboratory, consisting of
              PCs outfitted with state-of-the-art CASE and implementation software, along
              with collaboration tools, an instructors' station and server containing
              projects at various stages of their life cycle, and projection and
              collaboration tools to allow both local and remote group work. With the
              laboratory configuration, the lifetime of a single project, as in the real
              world, extends beyond the boundaries of a single course, or even an academic
              year.

After two years, Hiram College has committed to maintaining the
              laboratory and sustaining the project. With growing interest in both
              traditional and weekend programs offered by the computer science department,
              they expect 75 - 100 students per year to benefit from the facility in the
              future.
