Abstract    :
              Physics (13) This project is undertaking a significant enhancement of the Studio
              Physics I curriculum at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The curricular
              revision is focused on the replacement of many of the student activities
              currently used in the course with materials adapted from Microcomputer Based
              Interactive Lecture Demonstrations, "Real Time" Physics and Workshop Physics.
              Once a new activity has been developed, it undergoes a continuous cycle of
              classroom testing and assessment of its effectiveness. The aim of this project
              is to improve student learning in the Studio Physics I course at Rensselaer by
              improving the quality of the activities in which students engage during their
              time in the classroom. The primary motivation for this curricular revision is
              that the level of student conceptual learning in the Studio Physics I course is
              no higher than that found in traditionally structured courses. This is true,
              despite a progressive class structure, collaborative group work, computers in
              the classroom, and an increase in the faculty resources allocated to the
              introductory physics program. Hence, the primary goals of this project focus on
              increased student learning, with an emphasis on conceptual understanding and
              incorporation of guided inquiry activities into the curriculum, with the aim of
              providing students with exposure to science as a process.
