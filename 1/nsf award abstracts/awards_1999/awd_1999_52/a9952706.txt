Abstract    :
              Physics (13) The project is developing a University Physics course organized
              around models and modeling to make the subject matter and procedural knowledge
              more explicit, systematic and coherent. Two unifying themes run throughout the
              course: (1) structure of matter and (2) energy storage and transfer. The
              instructional method employed is a variant of the modeling method that has been
              so successful in high school physics. Students work in collaborative groups in
              a technology-rich classroom. Student learning, as measured by standard
              instruments, is considerably greater than under traditional instruction. This
              project is adapting the modeling approach to a large technology-rich studio
              classroom, and developing workshops for faculty for wide
              dissemination.
