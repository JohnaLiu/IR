Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)  A 300 MHz NMR spectrometer is allowing integration of high-field
              NMR spectroscopy throughout the undergraduate chemistry curriculum and offers
              expanded opportunities for undergraduates to participate in faculty-directed
              research.  Instrument features critical for the innovations include: (1) the
              increased ability at 300 MHz to resolve peaks of similar chemical shift, (2) a
              broadband probe for multinuclear NMR experiments, and (3) the ease of going
              beyond standard I-D 'H and 13 C NMR to include 2-D homo- and heteronuclear
              experiments in an undergraduate laboratory setting.  A number of experiments
              from the education literature and from the research literature are being
              adapted to provide appropriate experiences for undergraduates in a range of
              courses.  In the organic course, 19F NMR is being introduced in a new
              laboratory on asymmetric synthesis, and 2-D techniques are being applied to
              determining the structure of a Diels-Alder reaction product.  Biochemistry
              students use highfield NMR to probe sugar structures, while in the
              physical/inorganic chemistry laboratory a new experiment highlighting
              heteronuclear coupling is being implemented. Broad use of the NMR spectrometer
              throughout the Chemistry Department's courses is preparing students to
              undertake independent work in faculty laboratories, where research projects in
              organic, inorganic, and biochemical systems demand application of
              state-of-the-art NMR technology. The 300 MHz NMR spectrometer is a centerpiece
              of the College's steadily improving infrastructure for learning and research,
              contributing to the larger goal of encouraging our best and brightest women to
              enter careers in the chemical sciences.
