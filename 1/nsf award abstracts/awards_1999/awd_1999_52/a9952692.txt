Abstract    :
              GEOLOGY (42) The project adapts and implements a number of approaches to
              successful undergraduate introductory and advanced hydrology curricula. With
              the field and laboratory equipment and information technology we have
              implemented discovery-based learning of the hydrological system in communities
              surrounding Bowdoin College in mid-coast Maine. This motivates inquiry by
              linking hydrological studies to environmental issues in local communities,
              including groundwater supply and contamination and non-point-source pollution
              of local rivers and estuaries.  We have adapted Experimental Well Fields
              (Fletcher, 1994, J. Geol. Ed. 42, 491-493) which is used on the campuses of
              Dickinson College (Niemitz and Key, NSF ILI Award #9550929) and Queens College,
              NYC (Belitz and Ludman, NSF ILI Award #9851444).  This allows students to
              compare and contrast groundwater geochemistry and aquifer characteristics
              between fractured bedrock and sand-and-gravel settings. Two research watersheds
              with hydrological instrumentation, such as those at Alfred University (Hluchy,
              NSF ILI Award #9751265) and SUNY-Plattsburg (Franzi, NSF ILI Award #9551126)
              provide continuous time series of weather, flow, and water-quality variables,
              and afford students the opportunity to integrate study of the meteorological,
              surface and hillslope components of the hydrological system at the event scale.
              An internet-accessible database and visualization software, adapted from the
              GLOBE Project and a number of government sources, provides hydrologic and
              environmental data and metadata to undergraduate students, K-12 teachers and
              students, and resource managers and conservation groups in the area, linking a
              "hydrologic community of learners" in common discovery and education. The
              project also involves undergraduate faculty and students in enhancing
              earth-science education at nearby and remote rural middle schools, benefiting
              both in-service and pre-service teachers.
