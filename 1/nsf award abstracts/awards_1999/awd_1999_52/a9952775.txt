Abstract    :
              Physics (13) As part of a multiyear campus-wide curriculum reform effort, the
              Physics Department at the Colorado School of Mines is implementing a new
              curriculum and instruction for the calculus-based introductory physics core
              sequence for its engineering majors which is aligned with the ABET 2000
              criteria. This project addresses the second semester of the introductory
              sequence (electromagnetism and optics, or Physics II) which has been undergoing
              development over the past two years culminating in a pilot offering in the
              spring 1999 semester. While the integration of the learning activities in the
              new curriculum design cannot be overemphasized, the focus of this project is
              the laboratory component which adapts the MlT/Caltech "ZAP!" approach to fit a
              more traditional curriculum emphasis and delivery mode. The novel ZAP! approach
              places significant emphasis on design and fabrication of electronic circuits
              which is highly experiential and well aligned with these ABET 2000 criteria.
              However, in its current form, ZAP! is not deliverable within the time
              traditionally allocated to laboratories in the introductory physics sequence.
              In the modified Physics II laboratories the design/fabrication goals of ZAP!
              are adapted to fit traditional resource constraints, delivery modes, and
              curriculum emphasis. Limited prototype models of specialized equipment;	and
              circuits for these laboratories have been designed, fabricated, and tested in
              the pilot course. This project involves the implementation in the entire
              course. In their modified form these novel laboratory experiences could be
              readily adopted by other physics departments serving engineering programs.
