Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99) 
To support two new interdisciplinary majors in
              biochemistry and neuroscience, science faculty at Drew University are
              introducing the technique of fluorescence across the curriculum. The project
              seeks to bridge gaps in modern instrumentation necessary to enhance these
              majors, to overcome compartmentalization both within and between several
              science departments, to strengthen connections between the introductory and
              advanced levels of laboratory instruction across disciplines, and to increase
              interdisciplinary connections for students at all levels of classroom and
              laboratory instruction and undergraduate research. The project is purchasing a
              fluorescence scanner, inverted fluorescence microscopes, and
              spectrofluorometers to support the introduction of new laboratory exercises in
              introductory and advanced courses in biochemistry, biology, chemistry,
              neuroscience, and archeology. Current laboratory exercises are also being
              enhanced, since the amount of equipment available for students in science
              courses is being increased. The project is expanding the novel use of "Student
              Experts" to facilitate cross-disciplinary learning, expanding the involvement
              of RISE fellows (distinguished, recently retired, industrial scientists at
              Drew) in teaching and mentoring undergraduate students, and enhancing
              undergraduate research opportunities available on campus. The project's model
              for studying neurobiology is being adapted from programs at Wellesley College
              and Macalester College (both supported by earlier NSF funding - USE #9251547
              and DUE #9552134). In addition, material from an NSF funded chemistry project
              (DUE #9350850) is being adapted for use in chemistry coursework that supports
              the new interdisciplinary major programs.
