Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)
The New York Learning Standards for Mathematics, Science
              and Technology (MST) call for changes in the way mathematics and science are
              taught in the classroom, including in particular an increased emphasis on
              inquiry-based and problem-based learning. Since these reforms have key
              implications for teacher preparation programs, this project is obtaining
              specific computer technology, software, and accompanying data acquisition
              instrumentation to be configured in a laboratory/classroom environment
              conducive to inquiry- and problem-based learning and teaching. This resulting
              MST Laboratory is enabling prospective K-6 teachers to construct the critical
              links between mathematical analysis and scientific investigation and to develop
              the technological competence necessary to teach in accordance with the NYS MST
              Learning Standards. Project activities include adoption, adaptation and
              implementation of materials and technology for six mathematics- and science-
              related courses to be taught in the integrated MST Laboratory. These materials
              and educational practices are being adapted from the Long Island Consortium for
              Interconnected Learning and other projects in the Mathematical Sciences and
              their Applications Across the Curriculum Initiative. St. John Fisher College is
              a founding member of the New York State Coalition (NYSC) which is comprised of
              some thirty two- and four-year colleges. Dissemination of the results of this
              project is being facilitated by the NYSC.
