Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21) Over the last two years, the principal investigators
              have developed and implemented Calculus on the Web (COW) - an interactive
              Internet-based modular learning system for the study of calculus, including
              practice of basic skills and techniques, and "hands-on" experimentation with
              basic concepts. The COW environment is freely accessible to either registered
              users or anonymous visitors. This project is completing the COW environment to
              address a full three-semester sequence in basic calculus by: (1) creating new
              module structures that broaden and diversify the COW as a complete, on-line
              textbook; and, (2), further developing the "intelligence" and "human" character
              of COW's logical, syntactical and mathematical analysis and of its user
              interactions. Testing of the environment involves a variety of institutions and
              includes a secondary school component. Evidence also suggests that this
              particular online environment helps women students engage with the subject of
              calculus at a high level of interest.
