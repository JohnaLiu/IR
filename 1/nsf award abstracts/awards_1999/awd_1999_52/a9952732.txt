Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) New methodologies are sought in order to improve student learning
              in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET).  As a result of
              previous NSF initiatives, numerous teaching and learning models have been
              developed and await widespread implementation.  One model, the use of
              LabWorksII developed at the Air Force Academy, was a result of NSF initiatives.
              Our goal is the adaptation and full implementation of the use of LabWorksII in
              the chemistry courses allied-health chemistry, general chemistry, and
              analytical chemistry.  We are integrating the use of LabWorksII interface units
              into the laboratories, developing courses, implementing on-going assessment
              measures, and disseminating results from the project.  The expected outcome of
              this project is to increase student learning, satisfaction, retention, and
              enthusiasm for science, creating a better trained and more knowledgeable
              student who is more likely to pursue a career in the sciences.
