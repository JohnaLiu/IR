Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55)

Many measurements made in undergraduate
              electrical engineering laboratories may be carried out with general purpose
              laboratory equipment, but this manual process is slow, tedious, and prone to
              error.  Specialized instrumentation exists for many measurements tasks, but the
              expense of specialized instrumentation undergraduate laboratories may be
              difficult to justify. Computer-based laboratory instruments offer a low-cost
              alternative to such specialized instruments.  This project, whose theme is
              integration of technology into education is further developing existing
              instruments; to actively bring undergraduate students into the design and
              testing of new instruments; to integrate these new instruments into the
              undergraduate curriculum; and to create and disseminate software and hardware
              designs and curriculum materials in a form permitting other engineering program
              to readily duplicate.

  The project adapts concepts of using computer-based
              laboratory instrumentation from the research laboratory of Prof. John Webster
              at the University of Wisconsin and the research laboratory of the Health and
              Kinesiology Department of the University of Texas at Tyler (UT-Tyler) which are
              implemented into the Department of Electrical Engineering undergraduate
              curriculum at the UT-Tyler.
