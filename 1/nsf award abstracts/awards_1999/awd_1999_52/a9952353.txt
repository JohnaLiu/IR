Abstract    :
              Astronomy (11) The Education Office of the American Astronomical Society is
              conducting an ongoing program for stimulating systemic reform in a widely
              taught science course: introductory astronomy for non-science majors. This
              course serves a great number of undergraduates, including many future teachers,
              and has great potential for improving their science skills and influencing
              their understanding of and appreciation for science. However, as now taught,
              this course often fails to live up to its potential (see, e.g., Zeilik, 1999 or
              Tobias, 1992). This project partially supports two meeting of the chairs of
              astronomy departments to be held in widely separated geographic locations to
              make travel easier. In these meetings, chairs will (A) discuss issues
              pertaining to the teaching of these courses, (B) work with education experts,
              (C) identify common goals and valid measures of success, and (D) adopt formal
              resolutions, to be presented to the American Astronomical Society and to
              funding agencies, and then widely disseminated. The meetings form one part of a
              two-part initiative seeking reform of introductory astronomy courses
              nationwide. The second phase is a series of workshops for new faculty, which
              will address the training of new college faculty.
