Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

Northwestern Michigan College is improving the
              performance of students in mathematics by integrating other disciplines into
              the development mathematics classes and integrating mathematics skills into
              non-mathematical areas of study.  In this project, faculty are adapting the
              Richard Stockton College of New Jersey Quantitative Reasoning Across the
              Discipline program funded through the National Science Foundation to the needs
              of a community college population and curriculum. The project is focusing on
              beginning algebra, intermediate algebra, and introductory courses from
              communications, social science, business, and health.  Data is being collected
              to compare students' attainment of mathematics skills in classes offered prior
              to this integration of disciplines and afterwards.
