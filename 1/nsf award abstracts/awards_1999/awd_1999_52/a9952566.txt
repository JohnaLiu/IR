Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) This project establishes molecular modeling facilities to
              implement visualization, molecular modeling and computational chemistry in a
              multi-tiered approach.  These facilities are being used by all students taking
              chemistry from on- or off-campus sites.  The equipment required is a SGI Origin
              200 server and two SGI R5000 02 workstations. The multi-tiered approach has the
              following components: (1) Freshman Level: Molecular modeling is being used as a
              visualization tool for the investigation of molecular structure and its role in
              property determination. (2) Sophomore Level: Organic molecules are being
              analyzed using simple calculations involving molecular mechanics and
              semi-empirical methods to explain structure, reactivity and reaction
              mechanisms. (3) Junior Level: Quantum mechanics are being used to understand
              the strengths and weaknesses at the different levels (ab initio,
              semi-empirical, molecular mechanics) of calculation. (4) Senior Level:
              Molecular modeling is being used as a theoretical basis to explain chemical
              phenomena observed in experiments in an Advanced Laboratory sequence and in
              research projects. Many of the exercises used are based on recent articles in
              the literature (Journal of Chemical Education, Chemistry Educator) developed as
              a result of NSF-ILI support at a number of undergraduate institutions. Many
              have been piloted to some degree; full implementation is being carried out over
              the two year period.  All students (approximately 500 students/year) taking
              chemistry courses are being impacted.  Formal evaluation and assessment of the
              project will be carried out by an educational  specialist.
