Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
The project integrates an automatic polarimeter into courses
              including Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, Organic and Biochemistry for nursing
              majors, research-oriented General Chemistry laboratory, Chemistry for
              non-science majors, and undergraduate research. Experiments from standard
              research and industrial literature are being adapted.  The purpose of this
              integration is three-fold:  to promote student awareness of and participation
              in green chemistry, or the reduction of adverse environmental impact in an
              economically responsible manner, to facilitate student understanding of
              stereochemical concepts, and to increase student exposure to modern
              instrumentation that is used in industrial and academic research laboratories. 
              These purposes complement the goals of an ongoing Institution-Wide Curriculum
              Reform Project in science.  

The polarimeter is used in combination with
              other instruments to characterize optically-active products.  The objectives of
              this project are to train students to eliminate waste proejcts before they
              form, use water as a reaction medium, switch to biodegradable and non-toxic
              reagents, replace stoichiometric methods with catalytic alternatives, and
              understand stereochemistry as a classification scheme.  This latter objective
              falls under the rubric of a campus-wide NSF-supported curriculum reform grant
              that is already underway and will culminate in the year 2000 with the
              publication of a laboratory manual of modules suitable for nonscience majors. 
              Over 100 students per year are impacted by this project.
