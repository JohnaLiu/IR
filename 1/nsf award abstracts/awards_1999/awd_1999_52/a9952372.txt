Abstract    :
              Engineering - Civil (54)This project develops materials and pedagogy for a
              course on Environmental Engineering Using Geosynthetics--Landfills, the first
              in a series of planned courses. The materials are being used by civil and
              environmental engineering professors who teach courses in environmental
              engineering. Geosynthetics are flat, man-made materials that are used to
              perform engineering tasks. Geosynthetics form the liners, drains, reinforcement
              and filters used in landfills. Teaching materials are being constructed in a
              modular fashion that allow them to be incorporated into existing courses or
              assembled into a stand-alone course or courses. Student learning and teaching
              effectiveness are being evaluated by a professional evaluator.
