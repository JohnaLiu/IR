Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
The teaching of kinesiology has been revolutionized by
              the integration of technology throughout the curriculum, from data collection
              and analysis to the application of findings in educational and work site
              environments. This project strengthens the undergraduate coursework in the
              Health and Human Performance Department by integrating motion analysis
              equipment into student learning experiences.  Integration of motion analysis
              instrumentation into course work is being accomplished by adding interactive
              demonstrations to lectures, providing hands-on laboratory experiences, and
              encouraging student research projects that utilize motion analysis equipment. 
              The exercises students will perform are adapted from Carol Widule's manual,
              Biomechanical Foundations of Motor Skills with Computer Applications, which
              serves as a source of validated comprehensive electromyographic
              experiments.
