Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) Biology students become highly motivated when they
              engage in mutual, cooperative group learning. Students learn from each other
              under these circumstances and pursue answers to questions more efficiently and
              persistently than when working individually.  We are using two courses,
              Histology and Systemic Physiology, as pilot programs for the adaptation of
              cooperative and inquiry based learning techniques based on the "workshop
              biology" program developed at the University of Oregon. In the Histology course
              we are greatly reducing traditional lectures by substituting formal small group
              interaction and the use of a self-paced study guide which allows the instructor
              to act as a director of learning.  In both courses students are engaging in
              semester-long group projects culminating in formal presentations. These courses
              were selected because we have already successfully implemented aspects of group
              learning in them and quality software is currently available. This approach to
              student centered learning requires that the students have free access to the
              computers and lab equipment. This model of teaching is also being introduced
              into other areas of the curriculum.
