Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)
This project is addressing the challenge of curriculum
              attractiveness and efficiency in fundamental engineering. Its goal is to
              stimulate interest and enthusiasm among undergraduate students in
              pre-engineering, engineering, and engineering technology, and to foster more
              creative thinking and learning styles. Development and testing of one module
              for statics will result in educational material available on CD-ROM and the
              Internet which supplements introductory statics courses. The unique feature of
              this effort is that anthropomorphic machine parts and engineering formulas will
              interact with each other, with the students, and with audiovisual
              representations of the world's greatest scientists. Modules are emphasizing
              methods of system and process identification, pattern analysis and synthesis,
              simultaneous conditions, engineering modeling and approximation, and the
              'teamwork' of these methods in maximizing thinking and learning efficiency. The
              project is a collaboration between Northern Illinois University and two
              community colleges, Elgin Community College and Rock Valley College.
