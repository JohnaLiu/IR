Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) 

This project is greatly enhancing teaching
              laboratories in upper-division molecular and cellular biology, microbiology,
              immunology and developmental biology by providing students the opportunity to
              engage in experimental work which can now only be read about.  Introductory
              students are benefiting through undergraduate research projects on the
              restoration of the Benedictine Bottoms (re-establishment of Missouri river
              bottom lands).  The project adapts protocols in the literature for
              undergraduate use and is part of the institution's developing Biology Discovery
              curriculum.
