Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) This curriculum reform effort is creating an active,
              student-centered learning environment in which all students take responsibility
              for their own learning and develop the ability to work collaboratively and in
              which investigation and research are emphasized.   Lower-division courses are
              adapting an active, workshop-style format and in upper-division laboratories
              there is a reduction in reliance on standard exercises centered on laboratory
              manuals and a concomitant adaption of inquiry based learning exercises. This
              project follows a successful pilot and adapts ideas developed by Amy Mulnix
              (DUE 9559773).  In general, students are taught several flexible approaches for
              investigating the importance of tissue interactions on developmental gene
              regulation in early avian embryos. This system weaves together the disciplines
              of developmental biology, cell biology, molecular biology and immunology while
              addressing fundamental principles of development: fate, potency, commitment,
              differentiation and developmentally regulated gene expression. Students design
              and carry out experiments involving microsurgical manipulation of early embryos
              followed by techniques to reveal changes in mRNA and protein expression in the
              affected tissues. They present their results to one another orally and in
              written reports.  The inquiry-based approach adapted in this upper-division
              laboratory is being adapted in other upper-division courses as
              well.
