Abstract    :
              Physics (13)  Building on previous work by Laws and Luetzelschwab in Workshop
              Physics, and on previous work at Pacific University to develop lower level and
              advanced level participatory physics courses, this project is developing an
              intermediate program of physics teaching. The course, Modern Physics with
              Health Applications, moves the focus of teaching from a lecture-based and
              laboratory structure to a project-based approach. The course is being designed
              around four extended small group active-learning projects - Nuclear Medicine;
              Radiation Therapy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Neutron Activation
              Analysis.

The course extends the scope of inquiry-based courses in the
              curriculum and offers a highly relevant physics program for students planning
              to go into health schools and other health-related fields. By creating a
              classroom environment at each level of teaching that encourages inquiry,
              experience, and active learning about physics, the course may also have a
              substantial influence on how science is taught elsewhere.
