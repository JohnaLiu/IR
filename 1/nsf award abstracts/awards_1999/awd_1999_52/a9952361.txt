Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)

This joint project of the Departments of Chemistry
              and Biology provides the core for a teaching module designed to integrate
              introductory biology and chemistry courses.  Upper-level courses across the two
              disciplines are also being enhanced.  The courses affected are designed to
              increase the science literacy of non-SMET majors and integrate research
              techniques and design into undergraduate courses.
