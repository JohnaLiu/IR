Abstract    :
              Engineering - Mechanical (56)
This is a proof-of-concept project to demonstrate
              the feasibility of a Hypermedia approach to materials for undergraduate
              engineering education.  Highly visual multimedia materials will be developed in
              the upper-division undergraduate topic area of compressible fluid flow, with
              strong emphasis on experimental flow visualization.  A prototype CD-ROM is
              being developed that can be used by instructors and students as a visual
              supplement to any of the standard textbooks, and that points the way for future
              development of this educational approach.   The future development may include
              collaboration with a similar project for development of a CD-ROM for
              incompressible flow.  This project makes use of the low-cost and ease of use of
              CD-ROM technology, which is also suitable for national dissemination.  Faculty
              development is enhanced by providing faculty with an new supplementary teaching
              tool, while integration of technology is addressed through exercising student
              use of computers and multimedia in the learning process.  The materials
              developed here are designed to convey a sense of the laboratory experience, and
              that of the actual physical appearance of real flow patterns beyond standard
              text line drawings.  The project is meant to supplement, not replace textbook
              treatment with highly visual, research-grade material without intimidating the
              student or sidetracking the standard objectives of an introductory class. 
              Learning outcomes from the prototype CD-ROM are being evaluated at Penn State
              University and other institutions.
