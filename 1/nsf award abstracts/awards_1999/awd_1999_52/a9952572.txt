Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)  This project dovetails laboratory experiences that
              develop students' inquiry/research skills through concepts depending on
              spectrophotometric skills with a focus on the structure and functioning of
              proteins and nucleic acids into laboratory learning experiences.  Objectives
              are focused on results such as increased academic performance, increased
              enrollment and completion rates, and increased student interest in molecular
              biology-related upper division study and careers, with the outcome of
              disseminating information internally and externally regarding the effectiveness
              of the revised practices to maximize project impact.  Processes developed by
              Virginia Hartman have been adapted to guide development and implementation of
              the courses and modules.
