Abstract    :
              Physics (13) This project is developing Multimedia-focused kinematics questions,
              and studying their effect on student understanding. Multimedia-focused
              questions are questions where students must collect data from multimedia
              (animations in this case) to answer the question. Animations are being created
              using Physlets, which are physics Java applets, developed by Wolfgang
              Christian. Questions are delivered, and students' responses collected using a
              web-based homework system called WebAssign. The Physlet questions are based on
              known student difficulties in kinematics. Diagnostic instruments developed from
              research -- the TUG-K (Test of Understanding GraphsKinematics) and the proposed
              ATM (Animated Test of Motion) -- are being used to probe for the first time the
              effect of multimedia-focused questions on students' conceptual understanding of
              kinematics. The project is: (1) providing a model for the development of
              similar questions across the introductory physics curriculum if these questions
              are found to be effective, and (2) developing a set of kinematics questions,
              deliverable via the web, that anyone teaching physics can immediately use in
              their class. The questions are downloadable as HTML files from WebPhysics
              servers, available in the WebAssign question database, and available on the
              companion CD to an upcoming book Teaching with Physlets.  DUE themes targeted
              by the project are diversity, teacher preparation, and integration of
              technology in education.
