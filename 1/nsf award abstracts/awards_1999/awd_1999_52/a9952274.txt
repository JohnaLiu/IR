Abstract    :
              Physics (13) This project is developing a laboratory for electricity and
              magnetism. The laboratory is designed to provide a learning experience for each
              student that merges a physical concept having current research interest with a
              focus that makes the concept interesting and tractable. Visual Electricity and
              Magnetism is defined by a series of related experiments that lead to a clearly
              defined goal at the end of one semester. Communication, team work, and critical
              thinking are enhanced by the structured environment of cooperative learning
              groups. Each group consists of an experimentalist, a theorist, a referee, and
              an editor. After each student becomes acquainted with a laboratory experiment,
              the learning groups assemble. Each group collects data, analyzes the data,
              critiques the analysis, and prepares a summary of the day's accomplishments.
              Group assignments and assignments within a group are rotated periodically. This
              insures that each student has several opportunities to perform one of the
              well-defined tasks within the same group, and within other groups of different
              student composition. Courseware consisting of a Laboratory Workbook, LabVIEW
              (TM) software, and course related material is published by National Instruments
              on their web site. In addition to Web based publishing, National Instruments
              has the capability to distribute Visual Electricity and Magnetism on a compact
              disk.
