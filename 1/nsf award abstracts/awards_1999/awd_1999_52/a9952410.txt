Abstract    :
              Geology (42) 
The ICP-MS will be used, in conjunction with our existing ion
              chromatograph, in the chemical analyses of natural samples in both regular
              courses and student-research projects.  In our shared analytical facility,
              course-related exercises and senior research work are implemented across all
              four years of the curriculum in the Departments of Geology (5 courses),
              Chemistry (2 courses), Biology (2 courses), and Civil Engineering (4 courses). 
              The facility will also be utilized in the interdisciplinary Environmental
              Studies Program. The ICP-MS is being used as a research tool to provide
              experiences for all levels of students: 1) Introductory level students focus on
              exercises adapted from selected components of watershed investigation projects
              implemented elsewhere (e.g., Tonn and Whitman, 1996, Colby College).  Students
              collect samples that are analyzed outside of class.  In class, data are plotted
              and discussed in terms of conceptual models to determine how the samples
              attained their compositions.  2) Intermediate level students complete more
              advanced exercises adapted from a variety of projects elsewhere (e.g., Ousey,
              1993, Pennsylvania State University; de Wet, 1994, Franklin and Marshall
              College; Tonn and Whitman, 1996, Colby College; Lee, 1998, Auburn University;
              Dunnivant et al., 1999, Hartwick College).  The students collect, prepare, and
              analyze samples in largely inquiry-driven, open-ended projects. The exercises
              allow implementation of experimental design, practical sample collection and
              preparation techniques, and sampling and analytical strategies.  As final
              products, students prepare substantial written reports that include data
              presentation and interpretation components. 3) Senior level students use the
              ICP-MS in directed research projects (theses) adapted from their research
              advisor's own ongoing scholarship, or in projects largely of the student's own
              design.  These students collect, prepare, and analyze samples, and are involved
              in planning and implementing analysis and sampling strategies and data
              interpretation.  Many theses result in formal publications and/or presentations
              at scientific conferences.
