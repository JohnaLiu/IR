Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)  The objective of this project is to increase student
              awareness and understanding of agricultural science and related issues through
              the production of educational materials to be used in general education
              undergraduate agriculture and biology courses. The materials being developed
              are two modules that focus on important plant diseases as models of scientific
              concepts and societal issues.  Selected plant diseases and epidemics are being
              used as case studies.  The material being developed provides scientific
              information and demonstrates how issues related to agricultural science
              directly impact society. The World Wide Web site already in existence is being
              redesigned to allow students to further explore topics that are introduced via
              newly produced film and to engage in interactive virtual laboratory exercises.
              The Web site and modules are being evaluated in undergraduate courses at the U.
              of Illinois, U. of Massachusetts, and U. of Wisconsin.  The evaluation is being
              formative, to guide the direction of the project, and summative, to evaluate
              the final products and future development of additional materials.  The web
              site and instructor materials are being presented and demonstrated at regional
              and national science education conferences.
