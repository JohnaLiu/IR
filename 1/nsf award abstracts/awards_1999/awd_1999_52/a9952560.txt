Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21) This project in developmental mathematics is adapting
              and implementing materials from a previously NSF funded grant to Mt. Hood
              Community College.  The project is expected to result in higher student
              retention and increased relevance of the material for the students.  Moreover,
              the students are expected to be more successful in college level mathematics. 
              In order for these materials to be used effectively, both full time and adjunct
              faculty are undergoing extensive faculty development.  An evaluation involving
              both an external advisory board and internal record keeping is guiding the
              project.
