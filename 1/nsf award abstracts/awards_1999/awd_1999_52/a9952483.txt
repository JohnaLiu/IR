              Mathematical Sciences (21)

In this Workshop Precalculus project, the
              principal investigators are working closely with an outside evaluation expert
              and faculty associates from two and four-year institutions and public and
              private high schools, to design pedagogical powerful instructional materials
              that seek to help students develop a firm understanding of the function concept
              and the interplay between functions and data analysis, modeling, and problem
              solving.  The materials are being tested at model adopter sites representing a
              variety of institutions, both public and private and small and large, using a
              variety of teaching formats, from small group activities to interactive lecture
              demonstrations.  A comprehensive national dissemination program is being
              launched, which includes conducting summer seminars and workshops for college
              and university faculty and for high school teachers, augmented by a school year
              support program.

The Workshop Precalculus materials are intended for use by
              education majors (who are experiencing an effective pedagogical model, while
              learning fundamental mathematical concepts and skills) and by high school,
              community college, four-year college, and university students (who are
              developing a firm mathematical foundation for further study in the social
              sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics.)

Distinctive features of the
              materials include:
(a) replacement of formal lectures with student
              observations, computer or graphing calculator work, and interactive discussions
              (i.e., implementation of the "workshop" approach);
(b) motivation of
              underserved populations, especially students who have an anxiety about studying
              mathematics or do not respond to traditional modes of instruction;
(c) use of
              real world problems - "Interdisciplinary Lively Application Projects" (ILAPs) -
              as an essential vehicle for motivating underlying mathematical ideas;
(d)
              integration of data analysis and probabilistic concepts throughout the
              materials;
(e) innovative use of technology, such as the Microcomputer-Based
              and Calculator-Based Laboratory (MBL/CBL) tools and VideoPoint, to enhance
              student learning; and
(f) close attention to the outcomes of educational
              research in mathematics and science and to the outcomes of assessment
              activities.
