Abstract    :
              Social Sciences - Other (89) The major objective of this project is developing a
              computer laboratory for use in psychology and sociology undergraduate courses.
              This laboratory is filling a critical need, offering undergraduates the
              opportunity to learn through applied experiences in research design and
              statistics. The overall emphasis of the laboratory is on active student
              learning and enhanced instruction. Previously, students in the social and
              behavioral sciences learned statistics by taking courses from the mathematics
              department. Now they are exposed to many examples of statistical analysis in
              social and behavioral science research, indicating its importance and relevance
              within those disciplines. Building on the experiences of former NSF grant
              recipients, this laboratory is designed to meet three objectives. 
First, we
              are designing a new course in computer-based statistical applications. This
              course provides students with knowledge of SPSS applications, particularly how
              to use descriptive and inferential statistics in data analysis, based on:

              Undergraduate Education," NSF-ILI 9651363.
Second, the laboratory is being
              used for hands-on research in a methods courses in which SPSS and Ethnograph
              are integrated with research design, following Raymondo (above),

 o J. Rudmann, "Development of a
              Social Science Computer Laboratory to Improve Undergraduate Science
              Instruction," NSF-ILI 9350962.
 Third, the laboratory is being used as a basis
              for a sequence of core courses where computer technology is central. This adds
              a laboratory component to introductory and research methods courses. For
              example, students in Introductory Psychology are introduced to behavioral
              observation and data gathering with a software program called "Sniffy the
              Virtual Rat." Another course on Race and Ethnic Relations employs SPSS in
              conjunction with a workbook, following the work of Fischer (1996) and Raymondo
              & Garrett (1998) cited earlier.
