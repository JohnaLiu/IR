Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences  (21)

The Department of Mathematics at Arapahoe
              Community College is undertaking a program intended to make fundamental
              improvements in areas to better serve students.  These include the:

     (a)
              establishment of a state-of-the-art computer classroom;
     (b) uniform
              implementation of computer-based materials in a variety of mathematics
              courses;
     (c) design of laboratory manuals;
     (d) technology
              performance standards and technology performance assessments for each course in
              the project;
     (e) upgrading and expansion of tutorial and laboratory
              services for math students;
     (f) building of a strong partnership with the
              University of Colorado-Denver; and
     (g) provision of opportunities for new
              methods, course materials, and technologies to the mathematics faculty from
              area high schools, as well as community colleges and four-year institutions
              along the Front Range.

In this project, they are adapting and implementing
              materials used in the Mathematics Education Resource Center at the University
              of Colorado - Denver, the laboratory manual from the NSF supported "Calculus
              Institute Using Computer Algebra Systems, and other projects.
