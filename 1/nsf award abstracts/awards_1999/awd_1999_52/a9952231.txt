Abstract    :
              Astronomy (11) By adding undergraduate research studies throughout the astronomy
              curriculum, this project is improving both student learning and interest. With
              introductory classes of 180 students, however, this addition would not be
              practical without automating the observing process itself. The project is
              therefore constructing a powerful, completely automated, imaging telescope (the
              URSA observing system) using off-the-shelf hardware and by modifying existing
              telescope control software. The low cost and simplicity of the design make it
              attractive to smaller undergraduate institutions, and some high schools, since
              both the hardware and software are totally transferable. Students in the
              revised classes are able to learn the nature of research by doing it
              themselves. Student beneficiaries include about 400 students per year, of which
              approximately 50% are women and 20% are minorities. The project is adapting and
              implementing the successful results of existing robotic telescopes used with
              undergraduate classes at other institutions. The results of the study will be
              made available to others through several avenues, including presentations at
              conferences, publications, and a web site. Excess observing time on the
              telescope is being made available to students at other universities and high
              schools, and the general public, via the Internet. It is anticipated that
              graduates who become teachers will use the URSA telescope to introduce their
              students to astronomical observing.
