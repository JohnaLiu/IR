Abstract    :
              This project is adapting, implementing, and combining several successful
              programs in the algebra-based Introductory Physics Laboratories.  The changes
              are based on the most successful of recent laboratory-based programs: Workshop
              Physics at Dickinson College, Real Time Physics at the University of Oregon,
              and Tools for Scientific Thinking at Tufts University. Aspects of other
              successful programs are also being used as part of the adaptation.  However,
              its core will be a Real Time Physics approach.  This project is allowing
              students to use tools for real-time data collection and analysis.  All
              measurement groups in the laboratory share results via a network, allowing
              discussions of patterns in the data across multiple groups, as is done in the
              scientific community.  Since the laboratory experience usually affects all
              students in the introductory algebra-based physics course every semester, the
              physics laboratory is becoming one of the most important components of the
              course.  The Force Concept Inventory or The Force and Motion Conceptual
              Evaluation are being compared against a pre-post gain score with the national
              sample developed by Hake (1996).  The outcomes will be reported at local and
              national AAPT meetings, and will be submitted for publication.
