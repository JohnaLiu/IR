Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59) Engineering education is undergoing a fundamental
              transformation from the Industrial Age to the Information Age. This project is
              developing innovative programs to support student development and instruction
              in the first two years of an engineering program. Asynchronous Learning (ASL)
              courses covering an engineering core of calculus-based physics with laboratory
              experiences and statics and dynamics have been developed; these courses are now
              being enhanced to address students' preferred learning styles and to include
              training modules for developing students' self directed learning (SDL)
              capabilities. Collaboration with engineering science programs at two-year
              colleges is providing the first stage of dissemination, with eventual
              dissemination nationwide. Formative and summative evaluation will be built into
              the courses, with an emphasis on learner-centered evaluation tools for self,
              peer, and team evaluations. Commercial publication of the courses and
              self-directed learning modules is also being explored.
