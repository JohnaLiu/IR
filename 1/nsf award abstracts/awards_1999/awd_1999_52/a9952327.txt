Abstract    :
              

Biological Sciences (61) Emory and Henry College is creating a new
              curriculum in Cell Biology and an updated curriculum for Molecular Biology as
              part of an integrated and investigative cellular and molecular biology
              emphasis. The new laboratory equipment is being used by undergraduates in a
              series of laboratory experiments, investigative in nature. The project is also
              expanding faculty expertise and exposure to innovative pedagogy, thus
              furthering their professional development. The analytical instrumentation is
              being used to: 1) Establish a Cell Biology course and revitalize the Molecular
              Biology curriculum to provide direct access for students to modern
              investigative methodologies essential to understanding of basic biological
              concepts, 2) Provide students with the curriculum necessary to be competitive
              both in the workplace and in graduate and professional schools, and 3) Ensure a
              high quality of education to disadvantaged and traditionally underrepresented
              students. The project adapts and implements the successful project of Dr.
              Amelia Ahern Rindell (DUE 9851477) of Portland State and materials in the NSF
              Workshop on Curricular Developments in the Analytical Sciences.
