Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

The project is adapting and implementing video
              conferencing capabilities for classroom use to provide inter-university
              instructional interaction and professional communication. In particular, the
              project is intended to address two fundamental challenges in this area: cost of
              equipment and lack of support for direct interaction between students and
              instructor.   Initially, the approach will be used in calculus courses;
              however, it is anticipated that the use of this conferencing capability will be
              expanded to include courses in other disciplines as well as other mathematics
              courses.
