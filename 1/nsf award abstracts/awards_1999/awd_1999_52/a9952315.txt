Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

Environmental chemistry has proven to be an effective vehicle
              for exciting the interest of students in science at the undergraduate and high
              school level. However, it has been taught mostly in departments other than
              chemistry, and the few chemistry departments that have the environmental
              chemistry option certified by the American Chemical Society generally do not
              offer more than one environmental chemistry course, and several of the
              departments do not have any active environmental chemists conducting research
              on the faculty.

The prototype EnviroChem Library project provides examples
              of the resources developed by the environmental chemistry research community,
              teaching faculties in non-chemistry and chemistry departments, chemical
              education, and by industry.  The materials include such items as experiments
              and demonstrations of environmental chemistry, case studies, data sets,
              textbook reviews, and simulation programs.  The materials are classified for
              the level of student, and the type of use anticipated.  The resources available
              on the Internet site are evaluated for the pedagogy that is used. 
              Dissemination is a key component of the project, and includes workshops
              coordinated with the Environmental Chemistry and Chemical Education Divisions
              conducted at the national ACS meetings.  An evaluation committee composed of
              environmental chemists and chemical educators assists in the planning and
              execution of the project.
