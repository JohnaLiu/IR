              Mathematical Sciences (21)

The project is an extension of the Earth Algebra
              and Earth Math projects, funded by the U.S. Department of Education and the
              NSF. The goal is to produce versatile, technology-intensive materials for
              classroom use and teacher training. Reform-based applications are being
              incorporated into platform-independent software to make them accessible to
              anyone with a computer. The versatility of these materials allows an instructor
              to use them regardless of the textbook. Environmental applications from the
              previous projects are redesigned to be used in courses from algebra through
              calculus. The project features an inquiry-based format, Web-based interactive
              materials, seamless interface with state-of-the-art technology, use of real
              data, interesting applications of mathematical concepts, and flexibility of
              classroom use. Materials are being kept in an inquiry-based format for courses
              from algebra through calculus, both high school and college, and for in-service
              and pre-service teachers. The product is being piloted, tested, and evaluated
              at Kennesaw State, Portland State, San Juan College, Phoenix College, Dine'
              College and in high schools. Workshops for college faculty and high school
              teachers are being conducted, and the materials are being published on CD-ROM
              and other media.
