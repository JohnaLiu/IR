Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)

This proof-of-concept project addresses the four major
              problems that inhibit undergraduate students from taking computer graphics
              courses:  (1) course materials are inadequate, (2) the "programming approach"
              alone is insufficient to spark the students' imagination and interest, (3) the
              "design/modeling" element is virtually missing, and (4) the graphics curriculum
              has not kept pace with the rapid advance of graphics technology.  To provide
              students with a set of comprehensive knowledge and skills in computer graphics,
              the primary goal of this project is to design an introductory graphics course
              that covers all four major components of graphics (i.e., rendering, modeling,
              animation, and post-processing) in a coherent way with a breath-first,
              hands-on, learning-by-doing approach. 

To go beyond the current popular
              "programming approach" and to promote the "I hear, I see and I do" scheme, the
              secondary goal is to design software tools that incorporate all four components
              into a single and unified interface for students to (1) quickly appreciate each
              concept and algorithm, (2) practice design and modeling skills, (3) visualize
              the inner working of concepts and algorithms, and (4) perform semester-long
              programming projects without spending time on non-essential programming effort
              just to get a simple implementation working. 

After taking this course, the
              students will be familiar with the state-of-the-art graphics technology,
              acquire basic knowledge and skills, and be well-prepared to approach graphics
              applications and their software development with confidence. The impact of this
              project may also include an improved retention rate of computer science
              students and an increased employability of graduates in graphics related areas.
               The outcomes of the project include the development of a new course with five
              teaching modules, the development of supporting software tools for teaching the
              modules to be disseminated on a CD-ROM, and the results of an evaluation of the
              impact of new course on student learning and retention.  If this project is
              successful, future plans include the development of a textbook with CD-ROM for
              national dissemination
