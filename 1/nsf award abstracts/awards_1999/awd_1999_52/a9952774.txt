Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)

This project is to helping increase the pool of
              well-educated and highly skilled Information Technology (IT) workers. The
              project addresses the severe current national shortage in the IT workforce
              (about 400,000 IT workers in 1999) that is, unfortunately, projected to persist
              well into the 21st century (about 1.3 million IT workers in 2006).
Targeted
              audiences for the project include: a) community college on-campus traditional
              and returning students, and b) off-campus distance students and adult learners.
              The project aims to provide Online Educational Materials (OEM) for courses in
              Information Engineering Technology (IET) and Computer Science Technology (CST)
              areas at the community college level.

Objectives of and major methods being
              employed for the project to reach this goal include: 
1) development of online
              educational materials for twelve (12) advanced courses in undergraduate
              Information Engineering Technology, 
2) design and development of a prototype
              of a Web-based Instructional (WBI) tool that will comprise various modern
              communication technologies (for example, audio-, video-, and data-conferencing,
              application/document sharing, chat servers),
3) development of a User Manual
              for WBI tool that will help faculty and students to customize its features into
              their respective educational environments,
4) "beta"-testing of OEM at
              collaborating institutions, including historically black educational
              institutions, and evaluation of OEM by internal and external (both, national
              and international) experts,
5) intensive utilization of the "IT Competency
              Profile" that follows the Tech Prep model and NSF Northwest Center on Emerging
              Technologies IT Skills Standards, and
6) continuous faculty development on
              Web-based training and Web-based teaching in IET.
