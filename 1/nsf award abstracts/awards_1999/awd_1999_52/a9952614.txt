Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)
This project is adapting Trefil and Hazen's "The
              Sciences: an Integrated Approach," and the associated Laboratory Manual by
              Stanionis (New York, John Wiley and Sons, 2000) into a year-long course for
              non-majors.  Most of the adaptive work is being made on the laboratory side of
              the course.  The course is intended to redress serious deficiencies in the
              science preparation of most non-majors and education majors at Huntingdon
              College.  It will replace a previously offered course in the natural sciences
              that has proven ineffective.  

The new course is shifting emphasis,
              stressing more laboratory work and opportunities for students to learn how
              scientists approach research through direct experiences.  The new course is
              incorporating planned changes in pedagogy, including group exercises, that are
              compatible with laboratory practices and the learning objectives of the course.
               The course is incorporating computer technology in the classroom, by taking
              advantage of several of the many computer animations and demonstrations of
              scientific principles now available.  The prime objective of the course is to
              teach students how science works, and to explain scientific material to a
              general audience.  

The impact of the course will be assessed by a
              combination of data from student course evaluations, enrollment tracking,
              standardized tests, and following-up with students who enter K-12 teaching, in
              order to cover the impact on student teaching and early career experiences in
              teaching.
