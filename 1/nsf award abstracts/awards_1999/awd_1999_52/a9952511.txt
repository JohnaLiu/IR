Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)  At UCLA and other urban institutions, large classes
              and long distances to appropriate field sites make first-hand investigations of
              ecosystems extremely difficult.  Building on a prototype in development for the
              Santa Monica Bay (funded in part by a grant from NSF), this project uses
              computer technology to involve students in meaningful explorations of
              biodiversity in a second ecosystem, the deserts of the United States.  This
              Virtual Environment module includes: 1) a visually-rich tour of the ecosystem,
              including the major desert areas, comparisons and contrasts; 2) a substantial
              database of organisms and habitats enhanced by photographs and video; 3) a set
              of GIS habitat maps with information from management and conservation agencies;
              4) information about desert areas and their management; and 5) a gateway to
              additional information through library resources and the Internet.  The program
              also incorporates problems that require students to use these rich, complex
              databases as they construct phylogenies and investigate and write about
              ecological relationships.  Moreover, each year, through an upper division
              course at UCLA, the issues and problems presented, as well as the databases,
              will be revised and expanded.  The program is designed primarily for the
              university level, but the tour and habitat information are useful in biology
              and life science classes at the middle and high school level, and the databases
              provide information for students, research scientists, and resource managers. 
              The program provides both a model of active, inquiry-based learning and a
              useful resource for preservice and inservice teachers.  As the module deals
              with the major arid lands of the United States, it is exportable to and usable
              by universities throughout the country.
