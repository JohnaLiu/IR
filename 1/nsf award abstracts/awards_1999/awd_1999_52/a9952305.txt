Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)  To accomplish the goals of teaching non-science majors
              not only what we know from science (i.e., content), but more importantly how
              that knowledge is acquired (the process of science) and its relevance to
              real-world problems, we are adapting the inquiry-based approach to laboratory
              investigation for use in our general biology course for non-science majors at
              the University of New England (approximately 150 students a year).  In stark
              contrast to most "cookbook" lab exercises, in which the answers to research
              questions are known in advance and student performance is judged by the ability
              to follow instructions and how closely students approximate the anticipated
              results, inquiry-based activities engage students in open-ended investigations
              with uncertain outcomes, thus mimicking how scientific research is actually
              conducted.  Although the value of open-ended, inquiry-based labs is widely
              recognized, particularly in upper division courses, such labs are infrequently
              used in introductory science courses.  Nonetheless we are confident in the
              potential success of using inquiry-based labs in our non-majors biology course
              because of previous efforts to infuse inquiry into the secondary school biology
              curriculum (Biological Sciences Curriculum Study), and the subsequent export of
              this approach to introductory college biology labs (e.g., Leonard 1982, 1983,
              1989).  We are implementing a series of new, inquiry-based explorations, in
              which students conduct experimental research on the response of terrestrial and
              aquatic carbon cycles to anthropogenic change, because these issues (e.g., the
              effects of global warming on carbon flux from forests or oceans) place biology
              in a real-world context and illustrate the importance of multiple levels of
              study in biology (i.e., from cells to ecosystems).  Given that these new
              laboratory exercises require students to work through the majors steps of the
              scientific method, including designing and conducting experiments utilizing
              modern analytical equipment, our students obtain first-hand experience with the
              methods and process of scientific inquiry, as well as an appreciation for the
              role of technology in science.  We are evaluating the effectiveness of this
              reform effort on improving students attitudes towards science, comprehension of
              biological principles, and the development of basic laboratory and critical
              thinking skills, by administering several self-designed and externally
              available assessment instruments to students enrolled in the new laboratories,
              and in labs taught in a more traditional, "cookbook" manner.  In order to
              insure the broadest dissemination possible of the results of our laboratory
              reform project, we will share our experiences with colleagues at local,
              regional and national levels through a series of seminars, workshops,
              conference presentations and publications.
