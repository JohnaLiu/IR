Abstract    :
              Geology (42) With an upgraded X-Ray Diffractometer, equipped with
              computer-controlled goniometer, digital data operations, and modern safety
              devices, we have adapted exercises that provide opportunities for students with
              experience on modern analytical equipment.  The experience has increased
              student understanding of mineralogy and petrology with this more thorough
              treatment of X-ray crystallography throughout the geology curriculum and
              provides advanced undergraduate students with greater research opportunities. A
              one-hour companion course for Mineralogy (GEOL 241) implements substantive use
              of the revitalized XRD. Interdisciplinary student teams composed of geology
              majors, education majors, and environmental science majors work through
              exercises that are adapted from those developed with NSF support (CSI-8750682,
              USE-9151040, USE-9151549, USE-9251951) by faculty at Alfred University,
              Carleton College, Indiana University-Purdue University, and Smith College. 
              This provides students with experience in simple phase identification,
              determining relations between lattice dimensions and crystal chemistry,
              unit-cell refinement, and characterization of clay minerals. Student use of the
              XRD in Petrology (GEOL 242), Sedimentary Rocks and Stratigraphy (GEOL 303),
              Senior Seminar (GEOL 490), and Geologic Field Experience (GEOL 496) has
              promoted an appreciation of the instrument as a research tool. This project has
              improved pre-college teachers' content knowledge of minerals and rocks as well
              as their pedagogical skills. The interdisciplinary approach has ensured
              interaction between students with different backgrounds and exposed them to the
              problem-solving approaches used in the sciences.
