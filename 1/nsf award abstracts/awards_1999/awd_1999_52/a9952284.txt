Abstract    :
              Engineering - Mechanical (56) The goal of this proof of concept project is the
              construction and distribution of educational software and hypertext that will
              augment students' educational experience in engineering classrooms and
              laboratories. This effort concentrates on three cases of fundamental fluid
              mechanics laboratory material. Upon successful completion of this project,
              other laboratory materials can be constructed in areas such as heat transfer,
              structural mechanics, semiconductor physics, electromagnetics, and
              electrostatics. The software is being developed in several forms: executable
              binaries, digital images, HTML text, and movie files. Much of the material
              consists of actual experimental cases carried out in Arkansas Tech University's
              fluid mechanics laboratory. Detailed computational simulations of the
              experimental cases are also carried out and included with explanations.
              Students are playing a role in the selection and presentation of this material,
              through questionnaires and direct interaction. A small number of beta tests of
              the software developed (in the form of a CD-ROM) are being carried out at other
              universities.
