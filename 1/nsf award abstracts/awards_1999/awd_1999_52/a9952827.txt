This project is developing interactive multimedia
              learning materials based upon self-paced modules designed to promote mastery of
              basic science concepts and the use of scientific instruments. The PI's are
              utilizing recent research on cognition and effective science instruction to
              develop three module types: an integrated basic math/graphing skills module for
              biology, chemistry and physics; a module on atomic absorption spectroscopy for
              biology and chemistry; and a module on biotechnology procedures for biology and
              physics. 

Media-rich interactive material is being deployed on CD-ROM's
              linked to a web-based shell to provide material that can be easily updated and
              linked to a database. A team consisting of an instructional designer, a graphic
              artist, computer programmers, and content experts is being organized to design
              and implement the materials. Faculty from other institutions are involved in
              evaluating the prototypes. During beta testing, student performance on selected
              segments is being monitored. Once the materials are completed and tested, they
              will be made available to be disseminated on CD-ROM and over the web through a
              central repository. Presentations about the project are planned for national
              and regional science education meetings.
