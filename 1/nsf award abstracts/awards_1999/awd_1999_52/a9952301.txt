Abstract    :
              Engineering - Mechanical (56)
The Mechanical Engineering (ME) and Electrical
              and Computer Engineering (ECE) departments at Tennessee Technological
              University provide a background in the synthesis, analysis, and design of
              either mechanical or electrical and computer systems.  However, the current
              curriculum does not provide students with the proper platform to integrate this
              knowledge in an interdisciplinary, team-oriented, engineering design experience
              that includes mechanical, electrical, and computer control.  In order to
              address this issue, this project adapts results from the mechatronics programs
              at Virginia Tech and the University of Utah and implements them in the
              completion of a Mechatronics and Intelligent Machines Laboratory.  This
              laboratory boosts an effort to establish an area of concentration (an option
              for ME or ECE majors) that constitutes a seamless interaction between ME and
              ECE curricula.  The laboratory consists of 10 workstations that student teams
              use to perform lab experiments and to carry out open-ended mechatronics systems
              projects.  Project results are being disseminated through workshops for local
              industry and K-12 teachers, visits to local K-12 schools for demonstrations of
              student projects, and presentations of student projects over the Internet and
              at conferences.
