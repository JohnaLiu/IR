Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)  This project uses gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC-MS)
              as a key component in a developmental program to make laboratory courses more
              discovery-based.  The GC-MS is being used 1) to improve  introductory
              laboratory courses in General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry by making them
              more relevant and research-oriented for both non-chemistry and chemistry
              majors, 2) to enhance the level of sophistication in more advanced laboratory
              courses in Analytical Chemistry and Physical Chemistry so that  chemistry
              majors appreciate the significance and effectiveness of GC-MS for solving
              real-world problems, and 3) to increase the scope and quality of  undergraduate
              research programs, especially in the areas of environmental chemistry and
              geochemistry.  In order to accomplish these goals, advantage is being taken of
              the many imaginative experiments that have been published in chemical education
              journals utilizing GC-MS to explore problems in analytical chemistry,
              biochemistry, environmental chemistry, organic chemistry, and physical
              chemistry.  Several experiments are being adapted from these sources (primarily
              the Journal of Chemical Education) and implemented in a discovery-based lab
              program.  A science educator will assist  in evaluating the project.
