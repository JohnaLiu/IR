Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) As part of an interdisciplinary program in
              neuroscience, which is in the early stages of development, we are striving to
              promote student learning of fundamental concepts in cellular, systems,
              behavioral and clinical neuroscience, and to offer collaborative laboratory
              experiences in neurophysiology. A neuroscience concentration is being created
              that is centered around four core courses ranging from an introductory to an
              advanced level. The experiences of peer institutions in establishing
              neuroscience programs are being adapted. The requested equipment optimizes
              development of new laboratory-based courses, and enhances existing courses
              offered in the departments of biology and psychology. Addition of this new
              strength to our curriculum provides the breadth of training and cultivates the
              necessary critical thinking and technical skills for our students to enter the
              expanding number of clinical, industrial and academic careers in neuroscience.
