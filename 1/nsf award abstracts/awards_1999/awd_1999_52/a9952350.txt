Abstract    :
              Chemistry  (12)  The traditional way of teaching chemistry to undergraduate
              chemistry majors at most colleges and universities is to include a series of
              laboratory courses that complement the lecture courses. Each lab course has
              experiments chosen for their relevance to the concurrent lecture material. This
              project is implementing a prototype of a new laboratory curriculum, in which
              experiments are chosen not just for their relevance to concurrent course
              material, but also to illustrate and reinforce the connections between topics
              taught at different levels. A variety of experiments from current literature is
              being adapted for use in the new curriculum.  The curriculum has two key
              features not present in the current curriculum: (1) sequences of experiments
              that begin in the introductory course and continue with increasing
              sophistication and application to more advanced concepts in the upper-level
              courses; and (2) utilization of laser technology in all lab courses to
              illustrate and reinforce the connections between concepts. The laser
              experimental system also enables several modem concepts to be introduced into
              the laboratory curriculum that were previously only presented as theory in the
              lecture courses.
