Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)

In many morphological sciences too much emphasis is
              placed on uninspiring memorization of factual material with little direct
              application or problem solving.  The overall goal of this project is to develop
              a fully integrated digital video and microscopy laboratory that allows the
              implementation of student-designed investigative and exploratory activities in
              our morphologically oriented courses.  Several experiences from the educational
              literature are being adapted to provide appropriate experiences for
              undergraduates in a range of courses.  The equipment requested is allowing us
              to examine, document quantify and analyze all structures from organelle to
              organism in the context of a problem or investigative based format.  Several
              primary course are being served by this facility including Human Anatomy,
              Biomechanics, and Seed Plant Biology.  In addition, the laboratory is being
              used by students in our Biomicroscopy and Research courses, as well as students
              involved in K-12 outreach.  Each course is introducing curricular changes
              consistent with the existing department theme of investigative activities with
              special attention to current pedagogical reforms.  This facility is greatly
              enhancing and extending our students' investigative activities while fostering
              higher order thinking and integrative skills, improving our students'
              quantitative skills and assisting in our K-12 outreach activities.
