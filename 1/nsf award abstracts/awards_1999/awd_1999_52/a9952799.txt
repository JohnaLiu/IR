Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

The Department of Mathematics and the School of
              Education at James Madison University, in collaboration with the Rockingham
              County, Augusta County, and Harrisonburg Public Schools are creating a new
              program for the preparation of future middle school mathematics teachers.  The
              project is adapting materials from other programs and projects, including the
              Middle School program in mathematics at Illinois State University. The new
              courses will have the mathematical content and pedagogy as suggested in
              guidelines promoted by the Mathematical Association of America and the NCTM
              Standards. Each course is being developed by a team consisting of James Madison
              University faculty and a practicing middle school teacher.
