Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55)
Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a rapidly
              growing field that is creating a high demand for DSP-trained professionals.
              Industries such as the automotive, digital and wireless communications, digital
              control, imaging, video, medical, and data acquisition systems are in
              increasing demand for engineers with training in DSP. 

The project is
              establishing an undergraduate DSP Laboratory to provide students with hands-on
              experience in DSP. The project is adapting concepts and ideas from the North
              Carolina State University. The students are getting the practical hands-on
              experience in manipulating real signals in this instructional DSP laboratory.
              The laboratory is composed of PC-based workstations equipped with specialized
              DSP hardware and software. It is providing a real-time DSP environment for
              actual system design, implementation, and evaluation experiences. Allowing the
              students to handle real signals that they can hear and/or visualize is helping
              them better understand these concepts. The principal activities consist of a
              sequence of supervised experiments and design projects. These are being
              permanently integrated into the current DSP course. These activities are
              providing the students with invaluable hands-on-experiences and practical DSP
              skills.
