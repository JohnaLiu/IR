Abstract    :
              Physics (13)

Despite the immense importance of computation in contemporary
              physics, systematic efforts to use computers in undergraduate instruction have
              focused on introductory courses.  Starting in the mid 1980's, this Department
              introduced sophisticated computational techniques throughout its upper-level
              courses.  Distinguishing features of the approach include a focus on flexible,
              general purpose computational packages; application to theory and experiment;
              extensive use for preparing reports on technical subjects; distribution
              throughout the curriculum; and most important, introduction of computation
              early enough so that, subsequently, students use computers confidently and
              independently on their own initiative. 

This project is converting the
              experience acquired over many years, and the extensive library of instructional
              materials developed, into a flexible publication to support efforts to teach
              computation to undergraduate physics students at other institutions.  To
              achieve the desired flexibility, the project is creating numerous modules, some
              generic and others more specific to particular platforms and/or applications
              programs.  Working with commercial publishers, a convenient and effective mode
              of publication is being developed that will allow individual users to assemble
              particular selections from these modules into a text that is tailored to their
              specific circumstances.  Week-long faculty workshops and site testing are
              helping to refine the end product and contribute to its dissemination.
