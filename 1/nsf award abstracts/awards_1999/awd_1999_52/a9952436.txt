Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the
              feasibility of a junior-level course for pre-service mathematics, science, and
              technology teachers on modern communications technology tools for use in the
              teaching of mathematics-intensive subjects. The program is developing,
              disseminating, and evaluating pilot versions of the proposed course and
              accompanying software during the 2000-1 and 20001-2 academic years. In addition
              to prototype materials, the project outcomes will be assessed with respect to:
              1) soundness of the basic course concept, 2) expected outcomes of course as
              measured by student competencies, and 3) appropriate placement of course in
              undergraduate mathematics curriculum.
