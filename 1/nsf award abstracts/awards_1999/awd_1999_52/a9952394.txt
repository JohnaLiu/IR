Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)

This project is enhancing student understanding of
              physiological and biological phenomena by incorporating inquiry-based
              laboratories using computerized data acquisition systems into introductory
              anatomy and physiology courses.  The collaborating institutions, California
              State University at Sacramento and Cosumnes River College, are adapting
              laboratories exercises previously developed at Yuba College and Pasadena City
              College, which have been shown to be effective at increasing students' ability
              to explore complex physiological relationships and enhance students'
              appreciation of scientific processes.  Student-friendly data acquisition
              systems ease data collection and improve student understanding of physiological
              processes through critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity.
              This is increasing the number of introductory students who view science as
              accessible, valuable, interesting and applicable to their everyday lives, and
              who have confidence in their ability to use modern technology. Because these
              courses have large numbers of students underrepresented in the science and
              technology workforce (women, working parents, and underrepresented minorities)
              this project is specifically improving their preparation for entering careers
              in science and technology. Through the collaborative development of pedagogical
              expectations, we are easing the transition of students transferring from
              community colleges to CSUS and invigorating faculty by providing opportunities
              for collaborative curricular development. The outcomes of this project include
              implementation of new lab exercises and increased student success, demonstrated
              by improved student performance and enthusiasm for science, and increased
              transfer rates of CRC students to 4-year institutions.
