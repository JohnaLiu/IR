Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31) This project involves incorporation of hands-on activities
              that encourage creativity and exploration throughout the undergraduate computer
              science curriculum. It includes the development of the Senior Seminar and
              Project course into a capstone that emphasizes independent exploration of
              computing. It creates a laboratory dedicated to computer science students that
              is equipped with heterogeneous computing platforms and includes design of
              course assessment that requires creative thinking.

The project adapts
              material from previous NSF ILI grants to Swarthmore College, Bryn Mawr College
              and Hope College. It will also adapt operating systems courses to build
              open-exploration projects into the core courses taken by computer science
              majors, thus encouraging independent exploration culminating in a successful
              Senior Seminar.

The project will increase skill in abstract thinking and
              abstract expression of computer science concepts, increase ability to work
              independently on course projects, and produce interesting senior projects that
              demonstrate intellectual curiosity and creativity. This project serves as an
              example of the integration of technology into education. In this project the
              technology simultaneously serves as a tool for learning abstract concepts, a
              platform for developing concrete applications of abstract concepts, and a
              source for exploration of new concepts.
