Abstract    :
              Gas turbines create a very harsh thermal environment because of the high
              temperatures, complex flows, and the need to provide critical cooling to the
              structural components.   Providing effective cooling has proven to be a
              difficult problem because of the three dimensional nature of the flow.  The
              research will explore the flow field and heat transfer in a turbine vane
              passage with emphasis on the region of the endwall.  Experiments and
              simulations will be carried out in which the vortical motions will be altered
              through secondary air jets and contoured passages.  The objectives are to
              understand the details of the unaltered flow field, the effect of control
              strategies, and to develop effective techniques for modeling and simulating the
              altered flow, thus leading to improved design techniques.  The experiments will
              involve flow visualization, velocity measurements, and liquid crystal
              thermography.  Modeling will be done using both the Reynolds averaged Navier
              Stokes and detached eddy simulation approaches.   The work will be a
              cooperative effort between Arizona State University and Allied Signal Aerospace
              Engine, Phoenix, AZ.
