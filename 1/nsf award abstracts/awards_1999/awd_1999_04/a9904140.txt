Title:
              Understanding Changes in Atmospheric Composition the Climate During the Past
              200,000 years: The Paleo Trace Gas and Aerosol Challenge-Workshop; March 3-6,
              1999 in Jena, Germany

One of the most outstanding challenges facing the
              science of global change is to understand the forcing, regulation and climate
              feedbacks of the natural variations in the chemical composition of the
              atmosphere.  Variations of CO2, N2O, CH4 and other reactive trace gases, marine
              biogenic Sulfur compounds, and mineral dust need to be understood on decadal to
              multi-millennial time scales before the consequences of recent and future
              anthropogenic perturbations of atmospheric chemistry can be fully understood. 
              This award supports the U.S. participation in an international workshop
              designed to address such first-order phenomena as: the cause of low glacial CO2
              concentrations, the reason for the 2-3,000 years lag in CO2 drawdown at the
              beginning of glacials, the causes of enhanced atmospheric dust content during
              the last glacial maximum, and the locations of the most important CH4 sources
              during the glacial and  the Holocene.  The workshop will be held in Jena,
              Germany  (March, 1999) under the auspices of the IGBP.
