This project involves cultural anthropologists
              from the University of Maryland studying the cultural models of environmental
              hazards in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, stimulated by the toxic bloom of
              Pfiesteria piscicida. The researchers and their students will investigate the
              cultural models held by various stakeholder groups (farmers, watermen,
              environmental professionals, biological and agricultural scientists, and
              policymakers), linked through their involvement in efforts to improve water
              quality.  Using consensus analysis, a technique developed in cognitive
              anthropology, with a sample of 25-30 members of each group, the researchers
              will systematically document intra- and intercultural variation in beliefs and
              values regarding environmental pollution.  This project's theoretical and
              empirical focus is a continuation of exploratory research on the community and
              cultural consequences of Pfiesteria for farmers and watermen.  Project findings
              will be used to promote dialog between stakeholder groups on their similarities
              and differences in environmental knowledge, beliefs, values and practices.  An
              additional concern of the researchers is to assure the equal participation of
              under-represented groups, specifically farmers and watermen.  The project also
              continues developing a long-term applied research and training program at the
              University with a focus on preparing students to be practitioners as well as
              researchers.
