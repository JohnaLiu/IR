Abstract    :
              This project proposes the preparation and study of amphiphilic linear-dendritic
              hybrid copolymers.  Key features of these include a dendritic core with
              adjustable hydrophobic properties coupled with hydrophilic copolymers at the
              surface.  Structure-function studies will be carried out to maximize the
              surfactant and emulsifying properties of these molecules.  Emulsification
              properties will include the ability to stabilize oil emulsions in water giving
              an ability to solubilize significant amounts biologically active but water
              insoluble drugs.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program supports the research of Professor Toby M. Chapman of the University of
              Pittsburgh.  Professor Chapman seeks to construct molecular capsules that will
              carry water insoluble substances into aqueous solutions.  Study of the
              variation in these molecules properties as their structures are changed will
              allow one to finely tune these structures in order to permit the carriage of
              drug molecules for site-directed release at the optimal location.
