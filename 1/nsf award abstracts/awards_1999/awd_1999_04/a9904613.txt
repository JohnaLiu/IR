Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for partial support of the Annual Meeting of the Society for
              Developmental Biology over the next two years (1999-2000).  The Society has
              sponsored this annual meeting for 57 years (only missing two years during WW
              II), reflecting the long-term interest in this topic, as well as SDB's
              commitment to keep up the scientific quality of the meeting.  In the last few
              years the meeting and its importance in the community has grown so that last
              year's meeting in Stanford attracted more than 800 people.  The upcoming 58th
              Annual meeting will be held at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville
              from June 13-18, 1999.  We expect 600-800 registrants to attend and have the
              opportunity to hear the latest work from international leaders, as well as from
              younger scientist who are making exciting contributions to the field. 
              Fifty-five invited speakers will speak on topics including Morphogenesis and
              Cell Fate, Signals that Organize the Body Plan, Evolution of the Body Plan,
              Genetics and Development, Gametogenesis and Germ Line Development, The Cell
              Biology of Development, Cell Lineage and Cell Polarity, Wiring the Nervous
              System and Embryonic Patterning.  An additional 30 speakers will be chosen from
              submitted abstracts, allowing the inclusion of the most up-to-the-minute
              results and providing the opportunity for postdoctoral fellows and graduate
              students to talk about their work.  The afternoons will be devoted to poster
              sessions and workshops.  A special education symposium will address issues for
              teachers and for those interested in presenting science to the broader
              community.  In all the scientific sessions work on diverse organisms including
              invertebrates, vertebrates and plants will be presented.  We expect to continue
              to emphasize the best science, to bring together senior and junior
              investigators interested in developmental biology and to provide the forum for
              exchange of ideas on science, education and on the role of science in the
              society.
