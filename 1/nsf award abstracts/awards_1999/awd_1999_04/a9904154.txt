Abstract    :
              This action fund an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of cell biology and
              addresses the mechanisms of chromosome motion in the fission yeast,
              Schizosaccharamyces pombe.  Accurate and timely segregation of chromosomes
              during cell division is necessary for cell proliferation and is fundamental to
              the  cell cycle.  The specific objectives of this research are to determine the
              mitotic roles of two microtubule motor proteins, KLp1p and KLp2p, i.e.,
              kinesin-like proteins.
