Abstract    :
              This research project has as its goal the development of asymmetric
              photochemical reactions based on a zeolite / chiral catalyst combination.  This
              is based on the fact that more than one molecule or type of guest molecule can
              be included within a zeolite.  In the absence of readily available chiral
              zeolites, an asymmetric environment will be created by including chiral organic
              molecules within zeolites.  Photoreactions to be studied include the Zimmerman
              (di-pi-methane) rearrangement of dienes, the Norrish-Yang (Type II) reaction of
              ketones, oxa-di-pi-methane rearrangement of beta-gamma-unsaturated enones, and
              electrocyclization of polyenes.

With this Award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor
              Vaidyanathan Ramamurthy of Tulane University.  Professor Ramamurthy studies
              light-activated chemical reactions that take place inside the molecular scale
              pores of certain natural and man-made minerals called zeolites.  By permitting
              a certain kind of molecule to enter the zeolite cavity along with the reactant
              molecule, it may be possible to gain better control over the goings-on during
              the reaction.  In this way, high value-added substances of use for the
              pharmaceutical industry might be accessed.  Further, our understanding of the
              way in which molecules interact with zeolites and how this interaction affects
              the subsequent photochemistry will be enhanced.
