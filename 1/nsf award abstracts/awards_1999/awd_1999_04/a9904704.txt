Abstract    :
              In the quest for locating and determining the effect of underlying genetic
              contributions to individual phenotypes, the advances made available through
              current molecular techniques now make it possible to generate sequence data
              from several hundreds of sites across a given species.  Thus, the possibility
              exists to develop a method to address the association between DNA sequence and
              phenotype in natural populations.  This project develops a statistical
              methodology to detect DNA sequence associated with quantitative phenotypes in
              natural populations.  The project also develops methods to accurately select
              the correct underlying modes of inheritance responsible for generating the
              observed qualitative variation.  Th statistical methods developed by this
              project are made easily accessible and freely available through provision of
              public domain software and web access.
