Abstract    :
              The fifth consecutive FASEB Summer Research Conference on "Chromatin and
              Transcription" will be held on July 10-15, 1999 at the Conference Center in
              Snowmass Village, Colorado.

The objective of this highly successful meeting
              is to bring together researchers who study DNA-templated processes with
              individuals who study chromatin structure and organization. These disciplines,
              previously separate, are becoming one and moving forward at an unprecedented
              rate. The theme of the meeting is the impact that chromatin structure has on
              the function of basic cellular processes.
