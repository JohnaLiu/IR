Project Summary

Animals often fight
              over limited resources such as food, territory, or mates. Such fights usually
              involve ritualized behavior rather than unlimited aggression. Various
              game-theoretic models exist that predict under which conditions what kind of
              behavior would be most advantageous from an evolutionary point of view. The
              proposal aims at the development of an algorithm that simulates the evolution
              of behaviors for conflict resolution under minimal assumptions about payoffs
              and evolutionary constraints. An implementation of this algorithm will be made
              available to researchers of animal behavior via the World Wide Web. The
              algorithm will allow researchers to compare predictions of various existing
              models and hybrids thereof with empirical observations and will thus facilitate
              the choice of the model that best fits each particular case.
