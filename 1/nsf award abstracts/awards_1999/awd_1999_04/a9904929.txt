Abstract    :
              The United States Supreme Court has struck down approximately 140 federal laws
              because they violated the United States Constitution, while over 1,100 state
              laws have been struck down as unconstitutional. Yet despite the Court's greater
              activity in striking down non-federal laws, little is known about state
              legislators' views of the Supreme Court, their knowledge of the Constitution
              and Supreme Court decisions, and the role of federal constitutional
              considerations in state legislative processes. On the other hand, such
              questions pertaining to Congress are regularly studied. This project seeks to
              uncover variation across legislators and legislatures in answering the
              following central question: To what extent do the United States Supreme Court
              and the United States Constitution constrain state lawmaking? The methodology
              employed to answer this question is empirical, using results from mailed
              surveys of state legislators, bill drafting office attorneys, and State
              Attorney General office attorneys sampled from all 50 states, in addition to
              more detailed examinations of four case study states.
