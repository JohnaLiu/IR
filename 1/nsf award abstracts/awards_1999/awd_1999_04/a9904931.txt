Understanding the role of private information and learning is
              crucial for the creation of useful models in game theory and economics. While
              the profession has devoted significant attention to the analysis of equilibrium
              within such models, we still do not know enough about when we can expect, and
              what type of, equilibrium to emerge. Early studies and simple intuition suggest
              that positive results are more likely to emerge when we deal with large games. 
              This project investigates two types of large games: ones where the number of
              repetitions is large, and ones where the number of participants and/or decision
              variables is large.  Under the assumption that the agents are rational, or
              approximately so, the following issues and their applications are investigated:
              (1) representation of beliefs, (2) the possibility of learning to play
              equilibrium, (3) decomposing large games, and (4) the role of private
              information in large games.
