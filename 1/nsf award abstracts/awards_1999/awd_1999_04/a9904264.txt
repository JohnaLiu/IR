Abstract    :
              This proposal describes a one-year activity in which the PI will conduct an
              investigation and build a terahertz source using a semiconductor switch excited
              by a femto second fiber laser at 1550 micron wavelength.  The highly stable
              fiber laser will be of substantial benefit for THz beam generation with
              improved signal-to-noise ratio.
