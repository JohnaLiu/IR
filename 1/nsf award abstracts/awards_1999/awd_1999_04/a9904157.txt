Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of animal physiology and
              development and is entitled "Analysis of the function of a putative cell death
              inhibitor, BRUCE, in the mouse intestine."  The aim of the research is to
              analyze the function of the gene BRUCE in the intestine.  BRUCE has several
              domains that suggest it may inhibit cell death.  Since mice lacking BRUCE
              function have fewer intestinal cells, BRUCE may regulate cell death in the
              intestine.
