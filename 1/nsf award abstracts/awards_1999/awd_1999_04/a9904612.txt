This project will examine fluorescence excitation spectra
              of light-harvesting pigment-protein complexes from green bacteria, blue-green
              bacteria, and higher green plants. Far-field optical techniques with ~ 1 micron
              spatial resolution will be used to selectively excite and detect chlorophyll
              and bacteriochlorophyll fluorescence from single complexes at low temperatures.
              This will greatly simplify the interpretation of their electronic spectra. The
              latter are ordinarily featureless, smeared by protein inhomogeneities in bulk
              samples; they become highly structured and analyzable in single-complex
              spectra. The target systems include Fenna-Matthews-Olson trimers and
              chlorosomes from green bacteria, photosystem I trimers from cyanobacteria, and
              photosystem II antenna -reaction center complexes from
              spinach.

Single-molecule spectroscopy (which has been little applied to
              pigment-protein complexes so far) offers inherently far higher information
              content than conventional spectroscopy. It can bear new clues regarding the
              3-dimensional organization of light-harvesting molecules, the amount and
              importance of protein disorder, and the strength of the intermolecular
              interactions underlying their energy transfer role. It can provide novel and
              decisive evidence for the correct assignment of absorption bands to
              specific(groups of) molecules identified in protein crystal structures - a key
              step toward the long-term goal of understanding protein structure-function
              relationships.
