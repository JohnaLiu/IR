Effects of dissolved organic carbon source and
              concentration on proportions of active bacteria in a wetland
              ecosystem

Exciting new advances in the field of microbial ecology have 
              occurred in recent years.  We now know that microbes are the "unseen majority"
              among living organisms and play pivotal roles in  biogeochemistry and health
              issues in ecosystems across the globe.  Molecular microbial ecology is enabling
              much of the new knowledge and understanding.  In this project the investigators
              will apply a never-before-used combination of traditional microbial  tools and
              molecular techniques to understand environmental cues  that increase the
              proportion of active-as opposed to dormant-bacteria in wetland environments. 
              The roles of native plant-derived organic carbon and microbial grazers will be
              examined as controlling agents that influence the abundance of active bacteria.
              Since most bacteria  that occur in aquatic environments are dead or inactive,
              this research is especially important for providing a method for 
              identification and a new understanding of those active bacteria that perform
              important ecosystem services.
