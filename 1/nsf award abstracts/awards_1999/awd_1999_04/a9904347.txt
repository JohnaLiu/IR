	This project supports the dissertation research of an
              anthropology student from Emory University studying the parameters of medical
              treatment decision making by residents of the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. 
              The government has recently withdrawn its long-standing antipathy to private
              medical treatment, and the city is experiencing a dramatic increase in the
              number and diversity of health care options available to its (mainly poor)
              residents. The student will test hypotheses concerning the relation of illness
              severity and choice of treatment facility (the more severe the illness, the
              more likely the patient will be to seek private, albeit expensive treatment);
              that length of residence in the city will predict the individualized versus
              group nature of treatment decision-making (the more recent an urban resident,
              the more group-oriented the decision-making); and that illness severity will
              correlate with the style of medical decision-making (more severely ill patients
              will seek wider group consultation in a search for treatment). Methods include
              participant observation, semi-structured household interviews, illness
              narratives, life histories and extended case studies of a small number of focal
              families, This project will advance our understanding of how relatively
              uneducated, poor urban residents react to changes in medical treatment
              opportunities.  As more countries in the world convert from a command economy
              to a neo-liberal capitalist market economy, these sorts of changes in consumer
              choice will be more prevalent, and this sort of rich case study will be useful
              in understanding behavior in other similar contexts.  In addition the project
              supports the training of a young social scientist, and advances our knowledge
              of this important area of the world.
