This award provides partial support to the Gordon Research
              Conference on Colloids.  This  is a highly multidisciplinary field, for which
              the Conference will be exploring a broad, cross-cutting frontier.  The
              Conference is structured so that a very large number of foreign experts will be
              among the invited speakers.  The funds are to be used to make possible
              participation of students and post-docs to this international conference.
