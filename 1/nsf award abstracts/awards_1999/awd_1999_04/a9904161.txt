Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of environmental and
              ecological physiology and is entitled "Physiological and molecular responses of
              fish to fluctuations in environmental oxygen."  Intertidal fishes experience
              daily extremes in environmental oxygen tension.  Fish living under chronically
              low oxygen conditions have been rather extensively studied but less well
              understood are the adaptations to fluctuating oxygen.  This project will
              determine the physiological effects of daily changes in environmental oxygen
              and whether or not  fish thus exposed will express proteins analogous to those
              produced by mammals during low oxygen exposure.
