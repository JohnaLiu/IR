	The studies of the very highest energy cosmic rays are of
              fundamental importance. An indication of a break in the distribution at HiRes
              (Hi-Resolution) experiment energies suggests a new source, most likely
              extragalactic, of cosmic rays. HiRes presents the opportunity to study the
              properties of these extragalactic cosmic rays and possibly their sources. 
              Columbia University proposes to play a major role in this experiment.
