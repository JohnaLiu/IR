Abstract    :
              The symposium, to be presented at the annual conference of the Society for
              Integrative and Comparative Biology, January 4-8, 2000, will address the
              mechanisms by which living things cope with osmotic stress.  Aquatic and
              terrestrial organisms encounter changes in the salt composition of external and
              internal fluids that may alter the function of enzymes and the shape of cells. 
              These osmotic challenges are met by a repertoire of regulatory responses at the
              molecular, cellular, and organismal levels.  The twelve speakers in the
              symposium, drawn from Europe, Canada, and the United States, will summarize the
              current state of knowledge of osmoregulatory mechanisms in bacteria, yeast,
              plants, and animals.  Techniques of molecular biology, cell imaging, and remote
              sensing will be described as they apply to questions to ion regulation, volume
              regulation, and cell surface regulation.  The symposium will consider the
              overall question from the level of protein molecules to whole organism
              behavior, in a sufficient variety of organims to begin to recognize patterns. 
              To the PIs knowledge, this symposium represents the first time that such a
              synthesis has been attempted.
