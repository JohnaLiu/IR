Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to establish whether electrical 
stimulation
              can provide similar, or potentially greater, levels of 
control over neural
              cell behavior as the cocktails of chemical 
factors currently used.  To
              achieve this objective, two specific 
aims are put forth by the Principal
              Investigator (PI): 
 
1. Compare different patterns of stimulation with
              chemical 
   factors in their abilities to alter cellular behavior;  as a 
  
              model, the PI will examine rescuing neurons from programmed 
   cell death
              (PCD). 
 
2. Compare different patterns of stimulation with chemical 
  
              factors in effects on the calcium-sensitive cascade network 
   by measuring
              the signaling activity in different linear 
   branches of the network. 

              
If electrical and chemical stimuli can elicit similar effects, 
then a
              significant improvement in control over cellular behavior 
will be achieved.
