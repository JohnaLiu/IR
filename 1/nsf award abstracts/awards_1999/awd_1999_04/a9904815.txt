              Abstract

Neurons communicate information as sequences of electrical signals.
              The modality of the message is determined by the neuronal connections, while
              the message itself is coded by the number and frequency of signals within the
              sequence.  One of the problems faced by neurons is that the transmission of
              each signal is followed by an accumulation of Na+ in the cell. If it is not
              removed from the neuron this accumulated Na+ may affect characteristics of the
              entire sequence of signals and of the whole message itself.  It appears,
              therefore, that neuronal function should strongly depend on the activity of the
              Na+/K+ pump, the ion transporter that has a major role in maintaining stable
              concentrations of Na+ and K+ inside animal cells. Furthermore, it appears that
              the activity and/or characteristics of the Na+/K+ pump should differ in neurons
              with different discharge intensity and different needs in intracellular Na+
              control. However, aside from theoretical considerations, little is known about
              actual relationship existing between the neuron signaling and sodium influx
              into the neuron, isoform expression, and characteristics of the neuronal Na+/K+
              pump.  These questions will be addressed in the present investigation that will
              use the rat peripheral neurons as a neuronal model, and electrophysiological,
              histological, and fluorescent imaging techniques as tools to characterize
              neuronal function and expression of the Na+/K+ pump.
