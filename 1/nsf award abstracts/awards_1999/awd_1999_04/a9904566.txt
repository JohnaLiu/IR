Abstract    :
                 During development, neurons (nerve cells) produce long extensions called
              neurites, which can make long-distance, highly specific connections to target
              cells in the brain.  Many investigations have shown that particular molecules
              act as markers or regulators of this outgrowth.  One of the classes of
              molecules is known as the 'Eph' family.  This project uses molecular and
              anatomical techniques to show when and where the molecular receptor molecules
              in nerve cell membranes bind to the Eph molecules.  A novel approach combines
              studies in vitro and in vivo, using bioassays and mutant mice to discover how
              the regulation of the binding may initiate, inhibit or modify the outgrowth and
              directional heading of neurites in the nerve from the developing mammalian ear.
               
   Results will be important to understanding the formation of a major
              sensory pathway, as well as for developmental processes in general.  This RUI
              project also has a strong impact on education, by training undergraduates in
              research.
