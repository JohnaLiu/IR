Abstract    :
              
	This project will investigate how aggressive (dominance) interactions among
              animal society members can influence coordination at the group level.  Social
              wasps are ideal subjects for this work, given their complex colonies and the
              ease with which one can experimentally manipulate their social structure. Dr.
              O'Donnell will assess how variation in physiology and genetic background lead
              to individual differences in dominance status among workers, and govern the
              development of dominance.  In addition he will experimentally alter colony
              conditions, and assess the role of dominance in maintaining efficient task
              performance at the colony level.
	Animal societies of hundreds or more
              interacting individuals may be self-organizing entities. The society's labor
              force is non-hierarchically structured, and workers rely on communication with
              other workers to regulate their task-performance decisions. The proposed
              research will enhance our understanding of the regulation of division of labor
              in a well-studied, complex animal society. Furthermore, this research will
              yield general insight into how social coordination may be achieved in large,
              decentralized social groups. The proposed studies of social dominance will
              expand upon recent findings of physiological and genetic constraints on
              individual behavior, by examining the ways in  which an individuals' behavior
              may be integrated into a functioning colony.
