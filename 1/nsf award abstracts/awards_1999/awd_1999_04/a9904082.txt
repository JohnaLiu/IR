Abstract    :
              The Chemical Instrumentation Program is providing support to Julie A.  Leary of
              The University of California in Berkeley to conduct an NSF workshop on chemical
              instrumentation. The proposed format of morning keynote speakers and afternoon
              panel discussions is designed to establish a forum for discussing
              instrumentation issues relevant to NSF and academia, such as (i) important
              developments in instrumentation; (ii) shared vs. single user instrumentation;
              (iii) service facilities:  service, research, and teaching; and (iv)
              instrumentation needs for institutional research infrastructure.  The overall
              goal of the workshop is to provide advice to NSF on funding issues related to
              instrumentation development, acquisition and infrastructure.  The workshop will
              be held on April 16-17, in Arlington, VA., with roughly 65 participants from
              academia, government and instrument manufacturing companies.
