This U.S.-Hungary project between Michael Zigmond of the
              University of Pittsburgh and Laszlo Harsing of the Institute for Drug Research,
              Budapest, will examine neurotransmitter interactions in the neostriatum of the
              brain.  The researchers intend to conduct in vivo and in vitro research which
              investigates neocortical glutamate inputs and outputs to midbrain dopamine
              neurons from GABAergic interneurons in the neostriatum.  The researchers
              hypothesize that these interactions are reciprocal and occur with and without
              involvement of GABAergic projection neurons and interneurons.  Their
              collaborative effort builds upon established Pittsburgh expertise in
              neurotransmitter measurement and release, a Budapest-developed special
              superfusion chamber, and Hungarian experience with a unique method for
              stimulating a single afferent to the striatum in vitro.   Findings are expected
              to improve our basic understanding of the neurochemistry of the striatum and
              specifically, the transmitter interactions within the basal ganglia, an
              essential area in the control of sensory and motor information.

This project
              in neuroendocrinology fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to
              combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence.
