Abstract    :
              This award, supported by the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science
              Foundation, provides group travel support for participation of U.S. scientists,
              including a mixture of senior scientists and students, in the 8th International
              Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences to be held in July 1999 in Wellington,
              New Zealand. This meeting is held once every four years under sponsorship by
              the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research and is a primary venue for
              exchange of scientific results about Antarctic geology and geophysics and for
              discussion of possible international collaborative activities.
