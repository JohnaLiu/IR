Abstract    :
              
Osteoblasts and osteoclasts, bone-form and bone-resorbing cells, respectively,
              mediate growth, modeling, remodeling, and repair of bone.  The adult skeleton
              routinely undergoes remodeling in response to physical, hormonal, and metabolic
              stresses.  However, uncoupling of the remodeling process by increasing
              osteoclastic activity without increasing bone formation to the same extent, can
              lead to a net bone loss. 

The objective of this research by Dr. Wilson is to
              determine mechanisms by which osteoclastic activity can be increased to
              increase bone resorption.  Increased bone resorption can be a result of the
              formation of increased numbers of osteoclasts from progenitors and/or
              precursors.

The experiments in this award are designed to investigate the
              mechanisms of increased activity of the resident osteoclast population. 
              Cadmium, an agent that causes increased bone resorption, will be used to
              activate the osteoclasts.  One method to increase the amount of bone resorbed
              by a single osteoclast is to increase the time the osteoclast remains attached
              to the bone in its resorbing configuration, thereby increasing the time for
              bone resorption.  If this is the case, the extent of osteoclastic migratory
              activity should decrease proportionately.  Understanding the mechanisms for
              increased osteoclast resportive activity is essential for understanding the
              normal responses of bone to stresses on bone homeostasis.
