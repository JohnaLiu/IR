Abstract    :
              When animals produce characteristically different behavior, it is understood
              that the neural circuits underlying the behavior must have differences.  The
              focus of this project is to discover, in the context of sexual differences in
              behavior, how the nervous systems of males and females are differently
              organized.  A model insect system will be utilized to detail structural and
              functional properties of individual nerve cells.  Previous work showed that
              females have a neural circuit that supports a "female only" behavior, but
              recent work has shown that males also have most of the same nerve cells and
              that these cells can be induced to produce electrical activity similar to that
              of females.  This study will attempt to resolve how nervous systems with common
              elements and functional potential nevertheless produce different
              behaviors.
The significance of this project is in its contribution to the
              understanding of the biological basis of behavioral diversity, and in the
              insight it will provide into the evolution of variation in behavior.  The study
              will be conducted in collaboration with undergraduate students where it will
              provide an important, early opportunity in their education as scientists
