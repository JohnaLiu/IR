Abstract    :
              This project explores potential new methods in organosulfur chemistry,
              particularly those applicable to the synthesis of  the highly bioactive
              dithiolethiones.  New reagents and methods will be explored for the thionation
              of carbonyl groups, building upon the known chemistry of Lawesson's reagent by
              the use of additives and solid phase supports.  Other methods incorporate
              boron-sulfur compounds, dithioic acid dianions, and electrophilic organotin
              derivatives.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program supports the research of Professor Thomas J. Curphey of Dartmouth
              College.  Professor Curphey's research project explores new ways to incorporate
              sulfur atoms in various kinds of molecules.  Compounds that incorporate sulfur
              are found in the natural world as well as man-made, and display a wide variety
              of useful and interesting properties.  One class of organosulfur compound that
              is of immediate interest are the dithiolethiones, which have been found to be
              chemopreventative toward certain cancers.
