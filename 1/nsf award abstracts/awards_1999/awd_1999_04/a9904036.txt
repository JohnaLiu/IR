Research universities have done an exemplary job in preparing
              graduate students to conduct research.  However, in order to minimize the
              stress and difficulties of new faculty members and to improve the quality of
              instruction, attention must be given at the pre-doctoral level to the other
              aspects of faculty life, in particular teaching.  The Engineering Education
              Scholars Programs hosted by such institutions as the University of
              Wisconsin-Madison and Carnegie Mellon University are beginning to address these
              concerns.  We are proposing to host an additional workshop at Syracuse
              University's Adirondack Conference Center for three consecutive summers from
              1999 to 2001.  These workshops will broaden the preparation of advanced
              graduate students and junior faculty for academic positions by offering
              sessions related to the professional development of the participants with a
              particular emphasis on teaching responsibilities.  The goals of the workshops
              are to work with participants to provide them with strategies and tools to: 1)
              improve their teaching; 2) document and provide evidence of effectiveness in
              their scholarly life; 3) promote reflection about their practice and begin a
              plan for on-going professional development; and 4) enhance their ability to
              communicate to diverse audiences.

By the end of each of the workshops
              participants will have created a professional portfolio, which will include a
              reflective statement about teaching, a professional development plan, a
              videotape, including two presentations that utilize different pedagogical
              strategies, and syllabi.  Participants will also have established a network of
              colleagues to whom they can turn for support and collaboration, and be equipped
              to continue developing their professional portfolios and create a CD version
              which will be submitted in the February to the workshop faculty.

In addition
              to the summer workshops, we art also proposing to establish a Connection among
              the National Science Foundation's Engineering Education Scholars Programs. 
              During fall meetings the co-directors of all NSF-funded workshops will share
              materials, strategies, and evaluation results.  This also provides the
              co-directors the opportunity for collaboration regarding longitudinal
              assessment.
