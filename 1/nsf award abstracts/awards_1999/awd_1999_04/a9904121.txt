Natural disturbances may be so dramatic that
              the organisms that live in disturbed areas may be impacted by these
              disturbances for many years. However, few precise data documenting the impacts
              of natural disturbances are rare because reliable data prior to the disturbance
              is often absent.  This study proposes to take advantage of a unique
              post-hurricane situation and have proposed a series of experiments to study the
              impact of a major hurricane on animal populations. The scientists funded off
              this grant had just finished their annual census of lizard and spider
              populations on 19 islands near Great Exhuma, Bahamas, when Hurricane Lili
              passed directly over the study site. This work will examine the effects of
              Anolis lizards on spider and insect populations as impacted by this major
              storm. In addition, these sets of experiments will examine in detail the
              top-down controls of community structure and primary/secondary production. It
              will represent the first long-term experimental study of the impact of
              terrestrial top predators on entire plant communities. It is hoped that this
              research will elucidate the dynamics of a predator-prey metapopulation, a topic
              that has generated much theoretical work, but with few data from natural
              systems.
