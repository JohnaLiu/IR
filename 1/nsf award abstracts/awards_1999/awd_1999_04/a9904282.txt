Abstract    :
              Martin.9904282

This exploratory research investigates the possibility that
              ring structures in bat and rodent bones may provide climatic information. Long
              bone segments in modern animals that hibernate and those that do not will be
              embedded, sectioned, and examined under a scanning electron microscope. 
              Theoretically, there should be differences in skeletal morphology represented
              by these behavioral differences.  If successful, this approach can be used to
              explore the physiological strategies of ancient mammals, perhaps identifying
              the earliest fossil evidence for torpor in many mammalian groups.  Ring
              structures could also be used to infer climatic changes during the Pleistocene,
              perhaps consistent with interglacial and glacial cycles.
