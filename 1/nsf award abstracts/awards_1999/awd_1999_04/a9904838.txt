Abstract    :
              

Fossil rodent middens and paleospring deposits at key sites along a 1500-km
              transect in northem Chile/southern Peru will be used to reconstruct late
              Quaternary vegetation and climate histories in the Atacama Desert. There are
              several advantages to studying these deposits in the Atacama Desert: 1) unlike
              lake records, middens and spring deposits contain abundant vascular plants that
              suffer no "hard water" effects in 14 C dating; 2) rainfall seasonality can be
              inferred from midden occurrences of plant taxa tethered to either summer or
              winter precipitation; 3) the lower elevational limits of most Atacama plants
              reflect local precipitation (and not growing-season temperature), whereas water
              levels in springs reflect regional snowpack in the high Andes; 4) both middens
              and spring deposits are ubiquitous and preserve a regional history of
              vegetation and water levels along the upper margins of the Absolute Desert.
              Carbon isotopes in soil carbonates also will be analyzed and relict drainage
              networks in parts of the Absolute Desert that might have experienced periods of
              sustained rainfall and vegetation expansion will be mapped.

Three key areas
              affected by different synoptic climatologies will be sampled, and asynchronous
              climate histories are expected.  Middens and spring deposits near Arequipa,
              Peru (16.5 S) will allow the proponents to track changes in summer
              precipitation just 200 km west of Lake Titicaca.  Sites near Copiapo, Chile (27
              S), 600 km north of Santiago, should isolate variations in the strength of
              extratropical winter precipitation.  The central sites near Calaina, Chile,
              straddle the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5 S) and will reveal the interplay between
              tropical and extratropical rainfall belts. The proposed research will help
              refine current understanding of the nature and timing of late Quaternary
              climate change, and its hydrological and ecological effects, in subtropical
              South America.
