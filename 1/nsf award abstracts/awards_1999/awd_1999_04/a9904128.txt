Abstract    :
              	The goal of this project is to better understand the complex interactions among
              aerosols, cloud dynamics, and precipitation processes, and cloud radiative
              properties of boundary layer stratus, stratocumulus, and cumuli over water and
              over land surfaces.  Using guidance from the results of large-eddy simulations
              (LES) with bin-resolving microphysics, the PIs seek to develop a unified cloud
              boundary layer parameterization scheme that can accurately represent solid
              stratus layers, cumulus-topped boundary layers, and cumulus under stratus
              layers.  They will also explore the response of these clouds to varying
              concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), ultra-giant aerosols, and
              ice forming nuclei (IFN).  The specific tasks are to: (1) examine the influence
              of aerosols entrained from the overlying stable layer into the cloudy boundary
              layer on the radiative properties of the cloud layer;  (2) develop a mass-flux
              convective plume-type single-column model of the cloud-capped boundary layer
              that is interfaced to a cloud microphysics scheme including dynamically active
              aerosols (CCN);  (3) perform simulations of the cloudy boundary layer over land
              using an LES model with bin-resolving microphysics and coupled to a land
              surface soil/vegetation model;  and (4) participate in both LES and
              single-column model intercomparisons through workshops organized under the
              GEWEX Cloud System Studies (GCSS) Working Group on Boundary Layer
              Clouds.
