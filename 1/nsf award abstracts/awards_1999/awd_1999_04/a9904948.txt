Abstract    :
              This project aims to develop new groups of event-history models which control
              for selection bias in and out of the states of a covariate of the hazard rate
              of event occurrence, and assess the net effect of the covariate on event
              occurrence.  Selection bias in the effects of covariates -- such as whether
              men's entry into marriage causes a decrease in the rate of unemployment or
              rather uncontrolled characteristics of men who become and remain married at a
              given age predict a lower rate of unemployment, or whether marijuana use in
              marriage causes an increase in the rate of divorce or uncontrolled
              characteristics of people who become marijuana users and retain this behavior
              in marriage predict a higher rate of divorce -- is a central issue in the
              analysis of nonexperimental data in order to establish causality.  Although
              others have recently introduced some event-history methods/models to handle
              this problem, this project will develop distinct groups of models to handle
              aspects of this issue; in particular, mover-stayer models for bivariate hazards
              and their extensions, and loglinear latent-class models and their extensions. 
              As a related second aim, the project will clarify the characteristics of the
              new models regarding the reliability and stability of their parameter estimates
              and the dependence of the reliability and stability on alternative assumptions
              made to specify the models.

The project has five components: (1) development
              of software for the new mover-stayer models; (2) an elaboration and extension
              of basic loglinear latent-class models for controlling for selection bias; (3)
              applications of those models in social science research; (4) an investigation
              of the stability and reliability of parameter estimates as a function of
              specific assumptions made in the models; and (5) some comparisons of the
              results from the models/methods to be developed in the project with those from
              related existing alternative models/methods.
