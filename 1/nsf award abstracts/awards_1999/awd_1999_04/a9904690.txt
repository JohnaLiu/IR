This project outlines three research tasks designed to
              develop, validate, and improve a biological/chemical /physical model for the
              Arabian Sea. A focus of the research is to understand the Arabian-Sea carbon
              cycle, which requires that biological and physical processes be properly
              represented. To understand a problem of this complexity requires the
              development of a hierarchy of models that vary in dynamical complexity.  The
              present approach is to begin with a dynamically simple system, to compare its
              solutions carefully with available data, identify model deficiencies and to
              develop and test various hypotheses for overcoming them.

The investigators
              initial system will consist of three components: a 51/2-layer physical model, a
              4-compartment (NAHD) biological model, and a chemical model that simulates
              carbon and oxygen cycling. The system has the advantage that it is
              computationally very efficient. Consequently, the scientists will be able to
              carry out extensive test runs, and hence can carefully assess the influence of
              individual processes. Versions of each component model have already proven
              successful at simulating observations in the Arabian Sea and elsewhere, and
              this prior success gives the researchers confidence that the coupled system
              will also produce useful solutions. The initial system will be gradually
              improved and expanded as the investigators identify deficiencies and modify the
              model to correct them.

The central goal of the U.S. JGOFS Synthesis and
              Modeling Project (SMP) is to synthesize observational data into a set of models
              that can be used for prediction. Here, the investigators will bring together a
              group of scientists with the collective expertise necessary to achieve this
              goal for the Arabian Sea. Specifically, Sharon Smith contributes her knowledge
              of Arabian Sea biological and chemical fields, Raleigh Hood and Don Olson
              contribute their expertise in biological and chemical modeling, and Julian
              McCreary contributes his modeling experience of physical processes in the
              region. Each Principal Investigator thus performs an important function in the
              overall research effort.

In this effort the researchers will test
              fundamental hypotheses concerning the factors that control biogeochemical
              fluxes in the Arabian Sea. This region was selected to be the location of one
              of the four U.S. JGOFS Process Studies because of its strong monsoonal forcing
              and large seasonal oscillations, and indeed the project acquired the most
              complete seasonal and spatial resolution of carbon cycling among the four
              Studies. These field observations, in combination with concurrent ONR
              measurements, historical data and new satellite ocean color observations, thus
              provide an ideal data set for developing a coupled model that can respond
              realistically under a wide range of oceanic conditions. Consequently, the
              investigators expect that the results will be readily generalizable to other
              regions of the World Ocean.
