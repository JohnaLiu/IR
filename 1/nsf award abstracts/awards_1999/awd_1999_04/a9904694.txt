This project involves laboratory set-up for a research
              program in ecological and evolutionary genetics.  The initial research focus
              will be on outbreeding depression: the phenomenon of reduced fitness in
              interpopulation hybrids. This will involve a 3-pronged approach. First, genetic
              mechanisms underlying outbreeding depression will be assessed via breeding
              studies and molecular analyses using the microcrustacean Tigriopus
              californicus, a species in which interpopulation hybridization has been shown
              to result in substantially reduced fitness. Second, the generality of
              outbreeding depression will be assessed by measuring fitness consequences of
              interpopulation hybridization in other organisms, beginning with a study of an
              intertidal fish species. Third, computer simulations will be used to determine
              factors contributing to outbreeding depression.

Outbreeding depression is of
              considerable interest to conservation biologists because the frequency of
              interpopulation transfers is increasing, due both to accidental introductions
              and planned attempts to bolster population size.  Meanwhile, the fitness
              consequences of this population mixing remain largely unknown. The phenomenon
              is also of great interest to those studying speciation, because it marks the
              first stage of reproductive isolation.  Understanding the process of speciation
              is extremely important to those interested in preserving biodiversity.
