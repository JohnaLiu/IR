              ABSTRACT

OCE-9904410

A very large fraction of the downward fluxes of
              biogenic silica and organic matter in the ocean are derived from the
              productivity of diatoms in the surface ocean.  Not surprisingly then, there is
              much interest in understanding what controls diatom productivity, including
              mechanisms for recycling silica from sinking, decomposing particles back to
              growing diatoms.  In this project researchers from the Scripps Institution of
              Oceanography and the University of California at Santa Barbara will study
              contribution of bacteria-mediated silica dissolution to total biogenic silica
              dissolution by measuring Si dissolution under conditions where bacterial
              processes have been selectively inhibited.  The contribution of
              bacteria-mediated dissolution to biogenic silica production would be determined
              at the same time.  Radio- (32Si) and stable isotope techniques developed
              through recent NSF grants would be used to attain high sensitivity and
              precision.
