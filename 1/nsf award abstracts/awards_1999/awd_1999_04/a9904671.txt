Biophysical approaches will be applied to
              understanding protein self-interactions.  The approaches include structural
              methods, particularly X-ray diffraction, but also light scattering, NMR,
              sedimentation, and electron microscopy.  A key approach is the design and
              characterization of small protein molecules, with the aim of forming both small
              oligomers and fibers.  Both an alpha helical system and a beta sheet system
              will be explored.  The alpha helical system is an antiparallel three helix
              bundle; the beta sheet system is a left-handed beta helix, based on the known
              structure of a beta-helical carboxypeptidase.

The goal of the project is to
              understand at the atomic level, and to manipulate through design, how proteins
              recognize identical molecules and bind to them.  Such interactions between
              proteins are at the core of life: they control signaling pathways in biological
              cells, metabolic pathways, and assembly pathways.  They build up molecular
              machines that carry out synthesis and use of ATP, and the copying and
              translation of DNA.  The designed nanomachines of the future will almost
              certainly depend on designed protein interactions.  Also many applications in
              industry, agriculture, and biotechnology depend on improved understanding of
              the fundamentals of protein-protein interactions, on which this project is
              focused.
