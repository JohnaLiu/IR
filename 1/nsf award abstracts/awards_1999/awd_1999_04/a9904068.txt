This award will help to support a U.S.-Canada multi-national
              workshop devoted to optimization problems at the Fields Institute in Toronto,
              Canada from September 27 to October 2 1999 as part of a special year devoted to
              Combinatorial Optimization and Graph Theory.  The workshop is organized by
              David B. Shmoys of Cornell University jointly with Joseph Cheriyan of the
              University of Waterloo and Michael Goemans of CORE, Belgium, all part of a
              distinguished international organizing committee. 

Workshop topics reside on
              the interface between theoretical computer science and mathematical
              programming/operations research.  This award will help to support fourteen
              junior and senior researchers in the subject area.  Through small group
              interaction and a variety of topics, those selected to attend will be afforded
              the opportunity to meet and discuss current issues with senior panel members
              and colleagues. It is also anticipated that the workshop will lead to future
              collaborative efforts between workshop participants.
