Abstract    :
              9904946  Cannon  This is an award to support conduct of a workshop by the
              Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors to discuss
              recommendations that emerged from the Asilomar Research Frontiers Conference in
              1998 as a basis for identification of research needs to address topics that
              address topics that address foreseeable environmental issues.  Major topics to
              be addressed include the potential for contributions by environmental engineers
              toward achievement of a sustainable environment, applicability of advances in
              molecular level procedures in the biological and chemical sciences that can be
              applied toward addressing significant environmental problems at scales ranging
              from global/continental to meso/microcosmal.  A final workshop topic will
              address advances in process technologies that can be applied to address
              restoration and maintenance of acceptable levels of environmental quality.  The
              product of this conference is expected to be used in guiding the conduct of the
              Environmental Engineering and the Environmental Technology elements of the
              Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in the Engineering Directorate's
              Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems.  Results are also
              expected to assist in advancing the National Science Foundation's commitment to
              the core strategy of integrating research and education as articulated in its
              stragetic plan. ***
