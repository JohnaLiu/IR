Roberts/Mitra
During the formation of nitrogen-fixing symbioses
              between legumes and rhizobia bacteria, a set of genes is induced that encode
              "nodulins", proteins that aid in the establishment and maintenance of the
              symbiosis.  Nodulin 26 is among the nodulins that are targeted to the
              specialized symbiosome membrane that encloses the endosymbiotic bacteroid and
              mediates metabolite exchange with the host.   Nodulin 26 is a member of the
              MIP/aquaporin channel family, which includes a variety of proteins that flux
              water or uncharged solutes.  The protein has emerged as the prototype of a
              unique plant MIP subfamily that has an unusual multifunctional transport
              profile, including a low intrinsic water transport rate compared to other
              aquaporins, as well as the ability to flux uncharged solutes such as glycerol. 
              The purpose of this collaborative research (with Roberts 9904978) is to
              investigate the structural details of nodulin 26 that allow it to function as a
              multifunctional aquaglyceroporin.  The goals are 1. The rational design of 
              nodulin 26 mutants to identify residues/domains that determine the single
              channel rate and selectivity of transport (Roberts); 2. The purification and
              membrane reconstitution of soybean nodulin 26 (Roberts) for crystallographic
              structural analyses (Mitra); and 3. The functional analysis of a nodulin 26
              ortholog from the genetically tractable model legume Lotus japonicus (Roberts).
               

The recent discovery of aquaporin membrane proteins has revolutionized our
              understanding of how biological membranes facilitate water and neutral solute
              transport.  Aquaporins are a diverse family comprised of dozens of members,
              each with discreet functional properties tailored for its biological role.  The
              structural reasons for these diverse functional properties have yet to be
              unraveled. This collaborative project between a membrane protein
              cystallographer and a plant biochemist will provide a detailed structural
              analysis of nodulin 26, a unique aquaporin specifically expressed during
              nitrogen fixing symbioses.  This work will shed light on the structural
              features that enable nodulin 26 to be a multiselective transporter, and also
              will provide more fundamental information on the structural features that
              determine aquaporin activity and selectivity.
