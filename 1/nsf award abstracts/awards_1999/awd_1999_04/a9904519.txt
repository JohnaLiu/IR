Abstract    :
              The axon of a nerve cell (neuron) is the long process extending to a target
              cell, which carries the nerve signal to the target.  When the nervous system
              develops, the growing axons require mechanisms for guiding them over some
              distance to the right target cells.  It is commonly believed that any single
              decision about axon guidance is controlled by the interplay of a large number
              of molecular factors that may be secreted compounds, or compounds attached to
              cell surfaces.  The genetic and developmental mechanisms that coordinate the
              correct timed expression of different proteins for axonal guidance remain
              obscure.  This project concentrates on a genetic transcription factor named
              LOLA that appears to regulate the interaction of a class of motor neurons with
              their target muscles in the fruitfly, Drosophila.  Genetic, biochemical and
              molecular approaches are used here to see how two related Lola proteins act,
              whether they may act differently between the neurons and their muscle cell
              targets, and how the effects of lola are modulated by control of other genes.

                Results will be important for better understanding development in general. 
              The project also provides fine postdoctoral training.
