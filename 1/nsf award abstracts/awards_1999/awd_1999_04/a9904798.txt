Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division supports the work of Professor Donald Berry of the
              Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, which focusses on two
              principal objectives: (i)  the elucidation of those factors that impinge on the
              relative efficacy of "alpha" and "beta" elimination processes in transition
              metal complexes of alkyl, silyl and germyl complexes, and (ii) the exploitation
              of these processes toward the synthesis of novel systems with unusual
              structures, bonding and reactivity. The systems targeted are the metal
              complexes of formal divalent species such as carbenes, silylenes and
              germylenes, which have been implicated in a variety of catalytic
              transformations of organic and organoelement compounds.

The proposed
              research aims at understanding alpha and beta elimination processes, so
              important in catalytic processes. It will have significant impact on catalytic
              transformations and in polymer chemistry, as well as in making major advances
              in scientific knowledge. The work will contribute considerably to the
              intellectual teaching and training of students and post-doctorate associates in
              an area of industrial significance.
