1. Technical 

Metal ions in proteins play an enormous
              variety of roles. A few examples
include stabilization of protein structure,
              oxygen transport, redox
activity and nucleophilic catalysis. This proposal
              focuses upon three
different types of site: structural zinc sites, catalytic
              zinc sites and
redox-active iron sites. The approach taken is to design novel
              metal
binding sites on simple protein frameworks that are amenable to
              study
using a variety of biophysical methods. In this way the minimal
              requirements 
for a particular type of site can be systematically explored,
              and how these 
minimal requirements vary with the positioning of the site in
              the protein
and the nature of the local environment can be investigated.
              Additional 
features can then be incorporated. Such studies are complimentary
              to those 
in which a natural metalloprotein is changed by mutagenesis, or an
              active 
site is mimicked by a small molecule. They will both enhance our
              understanding 
of natural metalloproteins and generate molecules with novel
              properties. 

2. Non-technical 

Proteins play an enormous number of key
              roles in all living organisms.
A substantial fraction of these proteins are
              metalloproteins, which means
that a bound metal ion is important for protein
              stability or activity. A
wide variety of catalytic activities are associated
              with metal ion
centers. This project is designed to learn more about the
              requirements of 
such centers by designing new metal ion binding sites onto
              simple protein 
frameworks that do not normally bind metal ions. In this way
              we can determine 
the minimum features of a site that are required to achieve
              a particular
activity. The outcome of these studies will not only provide a
              better 
understanding of the functioning of natural metalloenzymes but also
              have 
the potential to generate proteins with novel catalytic
              activities.
