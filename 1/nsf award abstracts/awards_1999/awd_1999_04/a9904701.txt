Abstract    :
              


The objective of this project is to develop methods for protein fold
              modeling and protein fold recognition based on multiple structure information.
              Multiple structures sharing the same fold will be aligned to each other using
              3-D structure alignment methods. A statistical model for the fold will be
              constructed using the aligned structures and a training data set of structures.
              Methods will be designed to assess the compatibility of a query sequence to the
              fold model. Predicted structural attributes of the query sequence will be
              incorporated into the design of scoring schemes. Effective utilization of
              multiple structure information is expected to increase the success rate of fold
              recognition and the accuracy in threading sequence to fold. If successful, the
              results of this project will help to elucidate the functions and structures of
              many coding sequences from the large scale DNA sequencing projects.
