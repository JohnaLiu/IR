This Symposium by the American Chemical Society on "Block
              Copolymers: Designing Molecules for Applications" is co-supported by the
              Divisions of Materials Research and Chemical and Transport Systems.  Block
              copolymers are industrially and scientifically important materials, finding a
              wide range of applications including use as tough plastics, thermoplastic
              elastomers, compatibilizers for polymer blends, and as surface modifiers.  It
              is anticipated that use of polymeric materials will further expand in the 21st
              century due to their versatility, low cost, and lightweight.  The symposium
              will bring together established international leaders and top new investigators
              in the areas of block copolymer synthesis, morphology, properties, and
              applications.  Top industrial scientists will also participate in the
              Symposium.  The goal of the meeting is to evaluate the current state of
              knowledge in the field and chart a course for future investigations and
              applications.

The NSF funds will be used to partially support the travel and
              meeting costs for selected graduate students and postdocs.  This will assure
              that an adequate number of young scientists and engineers working in this area
              will be exposed to the current leaders and state-of-the-art concepts.  These
              young scientists are the future of the field.  The application and evaluation
              process used for awarding these "travel grants" will assure that women and
              other traditionally under-represented groups will be able to participate in the
              Symposium.  This will help prepare them to play leading roles in block
              copolymer research of the next millennium.
