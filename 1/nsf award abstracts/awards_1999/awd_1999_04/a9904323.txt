This grant supports the acquisition and development of a
              laser ablation (LA)-ICP-MS facility for geochemical research in the Department
              of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Minnesota.  Specifically, funds
              will be used to acquire a quadrupole-based ICP-MS equipped with a UV laser
              system for microscale sampling of solid materials. Owing to recent advances in
              the design and performance of laser technology, together with the striking
              improvements in sensitivity and signal processing characteristics of modern
              ICP-MS instruments, a wide range of research initiatives will now be possible
              that relate well to on-going and future activities in geochemistry at
              Minnesota.  Research projects that will make use of the new ICP-MS include:
              experimental determinations of mineral-fluid equilibria and kinetics in
              mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) at ambient temperatures and pressures; 
              development of yittria-stabilized zirconia ceramic membranes for use as pH and
              redox electrodes at elevated temperatures and pressures; studies of trace
              element zoning in metamorphic minerals; geochemical analysis of experimental
              run products from the multi-anvil press; and investigations of the microscale
              distribution of trace elements in biogenic carbonates.
