	This project supports the
              dissertation research of an anthropology student from the State University of
              New York at Binghamton, studying how refugees in Mozambique form new social
              ties through voluntary associations.  This research will advance our
              understanding of how social capital affects the behavior of post-conflict
              migrants in a hinterland city of Mozambique.  Through the analysis of data
              produced by several social science methods, including participant observation,
              ethnographic and survey research, ethnographic decision tree modeling, status
              role inventory/pile sorting and ranking, social network analysis, cohort
              analysis and life histories, the student will test hypotheses about the ability
              of new social ties to ameliorate insecurity in war refugees, the nature of
              shared interests in creating social ties, and the role of kinship in
              recruitment to voluntary social organizations.  This research will provide
              valuable knowledge to planners faced with the task of dealing with masses of
              refugees from conflict zones in many parts of the world.  In addition the
              project supports the training of a young social scientist, and advances our
              knowledge of this important area of the world.
