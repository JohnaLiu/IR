Abstract    :
              This project examines strategic behavior in relation to the European Court of
              Justice (ECJ). Three opportunities for strategic behavior will be investigated:
              referral of cases by national courts, court decisions, and national
              court/litigant compliance with ECJ decisions.  The research hypothesis to be
              investigated here is that both national courts and the ECJ are strategic
              actors, the main goals of which are to retain and increase legitimacy while at
              the same time to participate in the development of legal jurisprudence. In
              light of these goals, within the process under investigation, courts will
              manipulate institutional constraints in the following manner: national courts
              frame issues in cases sent to the ECJ, the European Court suppresses or expands
              issues, and national courts and litigants practice (non)compliance. These
              players interact in a strategic "transsemantic" game that begins at the
              national level and transcends this legal boundary to the European one. To test
              these hypotheses, the research investigates all cases brought before the ECJ
              for the top three referring national court systems in the following areas of
              law: free movement of goods, free movement of workers, and equal treatment
              cases within social policy.  Finally, to create a basis for comparison, the
              research examines the issue-fluidity hypothesis with data from the U.S. Supreme
              Court during two periods which differ in their degree of docket control
              available to the Court (1865-1891 and 1988-1992).
