Abstract    :
              This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification program
              sub-element of  the Interfacial, Transport and Separations program of the
              Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Dr.
              William Krantz at the University of Colorado.  The proposed research concerns
              the study of techniques for producing metallic membranes for use  in chemical
              separations in hostile environments.  This is an emerging research area with
              potential for significantly enhancing technology to do separations at extreme
              conditions.  The proposed tie-up with a small company is important and brings
              complementary skills to the project.
