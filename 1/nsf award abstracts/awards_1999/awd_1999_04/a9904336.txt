Abstract    :
              With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the
              research of Professor Kevin D. Moeller of Washington University.  This research
              project studies intramolecular anodic olefin coupling reactions, in which
              carbon-carbon bond formation occurs to afford cyclic products which retain
              functional group handles for further synthetic elaboration.  Professor Moeller
              is exploiting this reactivity for the synthesis of angularly-fused triquinanes
              and related 5-6-5-fused ring systems (alliacol A).  Analogous olefin-heteroatom
              couplings offer access to pyrrolidine rings, leading to synthesis of the
              immunosuppressant FR901483.  Through the oxidation of chiral enolate
              equivalents and subsequent nucleophilic trapping of the resulting radical
              cations, Professor Moeller seeks asymmetric coupling reactions, while other
              studies address the reversal of polarity in intermolecular alkylation reactions
              and the development of new oxidative routes to heterocycles.

Formation of
              carbon-carbon bonds represents one of the most critical requirements for the
              synthesis of complex organic molecules, and Professor Moeller is developing new
              methods to accomplish this.  In his method, the driving force for carbon-carbon
              bond formation is provided by the removal of electrons from selected reactants.
               Although such oxidation reactions are often effected by a variety of chemical
              oxidants, Professor Moeller exploits electrochemical techniques, using
              equipment as simple as a 6-Volt lantern battery to carry out the desired
              transformations.
