Abstract    :
              The investigator will work to understand changes in the heliosphere due to
              various stimuli from the Sun, over two magnetic (Hale) cycles. The main effort
              utilizes data obtained with the global network of neutron and muon detectors
              with median galactic cosmic ray response rigidity from 11 to 330 gigavolts. The
              investigation will test the limit of applicability of different models of
              cosmic ray transport in the turbulent heliospheric magnetic field. It will also
              focus on development of a technique for advance prediction of the number of
              sunspots and the flux of cosmic rays. Prediction of these phenomena is
              important for the National Space Weather Program, and is relevant to the study
              of solar variability as a driver of terrestrial climate change on decadal and
              century time scales.
