Abstract    :
                This proposal requests support for the 1999 Gordon Conference on Reactive
              Polymers,  Ion Exchangers       and Adsorbents to be held July 18-23 at New
              England College in Henniker, New Hampshire.  This is an important conference to
              the field and the objectives of the 1999 conference  are to provide research
              exchanges on ideas related to the fundamentals of polymer-supported reagents
              and their uses in enviromental and biochemical separations, catalysis and
              combinatorial century.
