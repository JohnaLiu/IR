Abstract    :
              
Mating stimulates egg laying in Drosophila, as in other insects.  We have
              shown that this stimulation is caused by seminal fluid proteins received by the
              female.  Dr. Wolfner has focused on one such protein, Acp26Aa that is
              evolutionarily related to hormones that stimulate egg laying by mollusks.  She
              showed that Acp26Aa increases ovulation in mated flies and that it is present
              in the female's reproductive tract and circulatory system after mating.

She
              will identify parts of Acp26Aa that are required for its activity.  She will
              also determine whether Acp26Aa exerts its effects from within the genital tract
              or via targets reached from the circulatory system.  She will survey known
              signaling molecules to identify the one(s) modulated by Acp26Aa.  Her results
              will characterize an important modulator of ovulation, and will begin to
              establish the molecular cascades that control a central reproductive process in
              a genetically tractable insect.  This research will also add significance to
              evolutionary questions and potentially to the design of biologically rational
              insect pest controls
