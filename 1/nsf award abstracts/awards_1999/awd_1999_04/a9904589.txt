Like other transfer RNAs, Drosophila tRNAs are transcribed as
              precursors.  The 5' end leaders and 3' end trailers are endonucleolytically
              removed by RNase P and 3'-tRNase, respectively. The CCA at the 3' end of tRNAs,
              required for aminoacylation, is added post-transcriptionally by tRNA
              nucleotidyl transferase (tNtase) after cleavage by 3'-tRNase. Like RNase P,
              3'-tRNase and tNtase are thus essential eukaryotic enzymes.
Drosophila RNase P
              will be purified in order to characterize its RNA and protein composition. The
              same will be attempted for Drosophila 3'-tRNase, the protein enzyme which
              removes the 3' end of pre-tRNA.
 Enzyme-substrate interactions will be
              characterized by gel mobility  shifts and UV-photo-cross-linking. The
              purification of Drosophila tRNA end-processing endonucleases will  contribute
              substantially to scientific knowledge. Putative RNase P RNA  from any insects.
              3'-tRNase has been much less extensively studied  than other tRNA
              end-processing enzymes, although the substrate  recognition elements and
              catalytic mechanism of 3'-tRNase are of great  scientific interest. Equally
              important, the project will provide valuable research training to
              undergraduates at York College which has a predominantly minority (51.9% Black,
              13.9% Hispanic, 9.5 % Asian, 0.3% Native American, 5.8% white), female (68%)
              enrollment. The project will strengthen enzyme purification skills used for
              both research and teaching. Some of the 
students trained in this research
              project, in a new Biochemistry lab course, and in the Biology and new
              Biotechnology majors, will join the ranks of under-represented minorities and
              women entering PhD-level 
Research careers in Molecular Biosciences.
