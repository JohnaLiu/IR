Abstract    :
              The focus of the grant research is on a set of issues that have come to occupy
              great theoretical attention in recent attempts to understand the basic
              phenomenon of associative learning.  It concerns the roles played by
              "elemental" versus" configural cues" in such learning.  The research uses an
              experimental approach that is shared by many investigators, namely the use of
              simple, well-controlled instances of associative learning about which a great
              deal of behavioral and biological information is available (in this case,
              pavlovian-like eyeblink conditioning in the rabbit).  Its aim is to evaluate a
              "componential" model in which elemental and configural cues are generally
              presumed to compete with each other within an adaptive-network
              environment.

Associative learning is a basic form of learning that is
              generally thought to be central to the scientific understanding of human memory
              and cognition.  The conception that is under evaluations holds promise of
              providing a principled account of the very different patterns of generalization
              and discrimination that is observed under what might appear to be minor
              variations in the conditions of associative  training.  The work should
              contribute to the continued development of quantitative, "neural-network"
              theory.
