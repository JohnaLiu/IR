Academic-Corporate Associates Conference.  The conference
              will bring leaders from industry, academia, and government together for focused
              presentations and workshops assessing the major issues and opportunities facing
              the geoscience community.  The conference will facilitate achievement of the
              goals of the AGI Associates program by initiating a public dialog between the
              employers and suppliers of professional geoscientists.  By means of focused
              discussion, the conference intends to develop and assess a set of defined
              issues and action items that will be used as a catalyst for change to better
              align the future supply and demand for geoscientists and to better the
              understanding of issues each side faces.  Through the participation of
              geoscience community leaders, it is intended that these action items will not
              only be a conceptual list, but an active charge for enhancing the effectiveness
              of geoscience professionals in addressing research and technology requirements
              to meet future societal needs.
