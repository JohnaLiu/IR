Abstract    :
              This research post-doctoral fellowship, entitled, "Morphological and Prosodic
              Structures in Tahltan," will investigate the stress in two dialects of Tahltan
              (Northern Athapaskan), and will lead to the development of testable hypotheses
              concerning the interaction of morphological and prosodic structure. 
              Rhythmically distributed stress and binarity requirements on words suggest a
              role for the prosodic foot in defining word structure.  The prosodic structure
              of the word is also implicated in the analysis of morphological stress.  In one
              dialect, the morphological stem is always stressed, which may be approached in
              at least two ways. On one hypothesis, stress assignment has access to
              morphological structure, and so stress feet may be assigned directly to the
              stem; on another hypothesis, morphological information is only indirectly
              referenced and regular stem stress follows from the alignment of the stem and
              the prosodic word.  A line of inquiry is sketched which will distinguish these
              two approaches on empirical grounds.  This analysis leads to a host of
              empirical and theoretical questions regarding the realization of stress in
              words with more than one inherently stressed morpheme, the analysis of
              compounds and inflected verbs, and the historical relationship between regular
              stem stress in one dialect and lexical stem stress in another.
