This award provides financial support for young
              investigators to participate in the Symposium on Future Directions in Nuclear
              Medicine Physics and Engineering to be held in the Biological Sciences Learning
              Center, University of Chicago, March 19-21, 1999.

The overall objective of
              the meeting is to provide an opportunity for leading researchers in nuclear
              medicine to present their vision for the future of the field and to ensure
              attendance by students and young investigators.  It is anticipated that the
              meeting will have a significant impact on the direction of research in this
              field.  

Results of the meeting are to be made available to a wide audience
              through the publication of a book wherein each chapter will provide a tutorial
              of the particular topic as well as discussions of the state of the art and
              future research directions.
