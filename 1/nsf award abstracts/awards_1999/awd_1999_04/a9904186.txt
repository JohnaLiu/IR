The work to be conducted is in the Undergraduate and Graduate
              Design Projects category.  Support is requested for senior year student
              engineers to provide approximately six prototype "custom designed" devices and
              software per year to aid persons with disabilities.  The primary goal of this
              thrust is to provide a meaningful design experience for the engineering student
              that will directly aid a specific disabled individual.  The formal program in
              place at Wright State University and the record of accomplishments already
              established by the Principal Investigator will ensure satisfactory progress on
              these projects.

Thirty projects are anticipated during the five duration of
              this award, and a written report about the completed projects will be submitted
              for an annual publication.  A group of students and the investigators on the
              grant will work with collaborating agencies and individuals on these projects. 
              When completed, the product from each project will be given to the person for
              whom it was designed.  The expectation is that this "real world" experience
              will give engineering students a sense of purpose and pride, help engineering
              schools serve the community, attract new students into engineering, and raise
              students interest in graduate education.

This type of undertaking is
              important since it provides a meaningful experience for engineering students to
              meet part of their undergraduate design requirements, and it also benefits a
              population where customization is often needed for assistive devices.
