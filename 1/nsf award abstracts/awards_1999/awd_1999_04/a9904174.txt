This  award supports the initiation of collaborative
              research on hybrid polymers between Professor Carmen Scholz, University of
              Alabama, Huntsville, and  Dr. John Foster of the University of New South Wales,
              Australia. The proposed research is a new partnership between two professors
              early in their careers and draws on complementary expertise of the two
              researchers. 

The proposed research is a comprehensive approach to the
              investigation and elucidation of the microbial synthesis of natural-synthetic
              block copolymers .   The research project will focus on two aspects: the
              elucidation of the enzyme system involved in the block copolymerization and the
              study of the material characteristics of the novel block copolymers, with
              exciting potential in the field of production of novel materials from renewable
              resources.  There is a growing demand for novel materials serving very specific
              purposes.  The quest for new materials focuses increasingly on environmental
              compatibility, most often biodegradability of the materials.  Environmental
              compatibility includes the production of new materials from renewable
              resources, environmentally friendly production, and hazard-free disposal and
              degradations of the materials after their use is exhausted.  This research into
              PHA-b-PEG copolymers will provide novel materials addressing these
              requirements.
