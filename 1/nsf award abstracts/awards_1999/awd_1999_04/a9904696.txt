ABSTRACT


This grant will financially
              assist attendees to the 1999 Gordon Conference in Catalysis, to be held at
              Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire, on June 20 through June 25,
              1999.  The grant will cover portion of the travel and registration costs for
              young investigators, faculty without current funding and graduate students. 
              This conference will be focused on three areas: combinatorial synthesis, novel
              materials for catalysis, and Special topics in catalysis.  Particular topics
              will include:  combinatorial synthesis analysis, and microengineering;
              nano-engineered metals, mesoprous oxides, and heterogenized metallocene
              polymerization catalysts; molecular modeling and simulation, solid acid
              catalysis, and heteroatom (such as chlorine) removal for environmental
              benefaction.
