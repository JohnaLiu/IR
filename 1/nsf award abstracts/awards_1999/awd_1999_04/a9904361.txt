Abstract    :
              This Post-Doctoral Research project will assess how environmental justice
              activists challenge the regulatory status quo by pushing to democratize
              environmental health research and poliey-making. A case study approach will be
              used to explore the contentious political and scientific issues raised by the
              emergence of market-based approaches to pollution regulation, with an emphasis
              on air pollution trading. How community-initiated protest promotes discussion
              among scientists and polieymakers about inherent short-comings of traditional
              approaches to environmental science research and regulation will be examined by
              addressing the following issues: I ) conflict over the technocratic rationalism
              of risk assessment and 'acceptable risk;' 2) treatment of scientific
              uncertainty and regulatory tendency to err on the side of rejecting
              environmental causation; 3) tension between policy-makers' emphasis on 'good
              science' versus the reality of scientific uncertainty and data gaps that hinder
              effective monitoring and enforcement of market-based emissions reduction
              programs; 4) incorporating structural variables such as class and race into
              assessments of biological susceptibility to environmental pollutants; 4) how to
              assess whether trading programs create or aggravate existing "hotspot"
              situations by concentrating tonics in communities already severely impacted by
              pollution; 5) the need to move risk assessment beyond traditional
              chemical-by-chemical analysis toward a cumulative exposure approach that
              accounts for the exposure realities of diverse populations. Finally, the
              question of whether environmental justice discourse and organizing can
              successfully move environmental policy-making from a pollution control to a
              prevention framework will be assessed.
