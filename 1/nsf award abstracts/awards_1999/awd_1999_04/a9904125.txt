Abstract    :
              Bert Holmes of the University of North Carolina at Asheville is supported by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in a RUI award to study the
              unimolecular decomposition reactions of chemically activated haloalkanes,
              haloalcohols, and haloethers in the gas phase.  The primary project objective
              is to determine experimentally the unimolecular rate constants, reaction
              mechanisms, and branching ratios for reactions of chemically activated
              compounds.  As well, ab initio calculations will be conducted for these three
              classes of compounds that will improve the understanding of the relevant
              transition state structures.  The overall outcomes are expected to elucidate
              substituent effects and structure-reactivity relationships, and improve the
              fundamental understanding of the unimolecular reactions of these compounds. 
              Undergraduate students at UNC Asheville will participate in these research
              projects to develop analytical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities. 
              The active participation of undergraduate research students is expected to
              strengthen the science education environment in chemistry at Holmes'
              institution.  

Students who are involved in significant chemical research
              throughout the undergraduate years gain a broader scope of challenges and the
              dedication required for scientific efforts while developing skills in
              laboratory science.  In this project, undergraduate students will have
              opportunities to study compounds that have found practical applications as
              anesthetics, lubricants, and blood substitutes. Incineration of haloalkanes is
              often the method selected for environmental remediation of these chemicals; the
              present study will also provide relevant information to understand these
              processes.
