              ABSTRACT

JAMES F. DRISCOLL		CTS-9904198

This is an experimental study to
              quantify, for the first time, the local propagation speed along the surface of
              a turbulent, premixed flame.  As bulges and cusps form on the wrinkled flame
              surface, certain flame segments propagate forward at unusually large speeds.  A
              PIV-PLIF ( particle imaging velocimetry- planar laser induced fluorescence)
              diagnostic has been used to measure propagation speed for an unsteady, curved,
              two-dimensional laminar flame that undergoes a flame-vortex interaction.  In
              this study, this technique is extended to the three-dimensional (3-D) flame
              case  by using two sets of orthogonal laser light sheets.  The effort includes
              (a) measurements of local propagation speed along a turbulent flame surface;
              (b) measurements of 3-D flame stretch rates; (c) identification of cusps and
              bulges in the flame front that yield abnormally large local propagation speeds
              and investigation of the physical reasons for these abnormalities; images allow
              correlation of fast flame propagation with the presence of a vortex, with flame
              curvature, or with the sharing of radicals between flame segments; (d)
              comparison of measured propagation speeds to those from advanced direct
              numerical simulations (DNS) from various groups; and to those predicted by the
              Theory of Flame Stretch.
Local propagation velocity is the key quantity that
              must be correctly modeled in order to develop large-eddy simulations (LES) of
              premixed and partially premixed combustion.  Such models offer the possibility
              of major new breakthroughs in turbulent combustion, including the development
              of low-polluting gas-turbine and internal-combustion engines.
