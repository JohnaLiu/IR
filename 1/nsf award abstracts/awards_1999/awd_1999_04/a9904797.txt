Abstract    :
              
The mode of action of a protein secreted by teratocytes (extra embryonic cells
              of a parasitic wasp) will be studied.  A cDNA encoding the protein has been
              cloned.  It has been expressed in a recombinant system and work is underway to
              place it in a plant system.  The potential practical application of this gene
              will be to express it in transgenic plants that would be resistant to insect
              feeding or in an agent that will infect targeted insect species.  In either
              case, the expression of the gene will be used as a means to achieve selective
              control of the growth and development of economically important insect pests. 
              Benefits would include reduced pesticide use and related environmental
              concerns, protection of nontarget species and increased yield resulting from
              less insect damage.
