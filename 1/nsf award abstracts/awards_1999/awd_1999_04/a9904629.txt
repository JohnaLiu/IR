Abstract    :
              Proper cell division is critical for life and the timing of division must be
              carefully regulated such that each new cell has everything it needs for
              independent growth.  The site of the new division must also be carefully
              regulated so that no important cell components are damaged or left behind
              during the division process.  Much has been learned about how cells divide from
              studies of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  In particular, studies
              in yeast have shown that a group of proteins called the septins act as a
              scaffold to organize the division site.  Septins will be investigated in the
              filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans that use both budding and nonbudding
              divisions in order to learn more about the role of septins during both kinds of
              cell division.  Because fungal cells divide by synthesis of new cell wall
              material to form crosswalls, this research should tell us more about the steps
              needed to assemble fungal cell walls in a specific area of the cell.  The goals
              of this research are: 1) to clone all septin genes from A. nidulans; 2) to
              localize septin gene products at the light microscope and ultrastructural
              levels, and 3) to characterize and alter septin gene expression during
              vegetative and reproductive development.
