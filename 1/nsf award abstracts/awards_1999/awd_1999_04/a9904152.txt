Abstract    :
              This action funds and NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of biochemistry and is
              entitled " Transcriptional regulation of endonuclease V in E. coli."  In the
              presence of a common environmental mutagen (nitrous acid) the nfi gene in E.
              coli turns on the production of the DNA repair enzyme endonuclease V which in
              turn repairs mistakes in DNA.   This work will investigate the regulation of
              nfi and lay the groundwork for studies on other regulatory pathways for the nfi
              gene, the control of genes other than nfi belonging to the same regulon, and
              other regulatory pathways.
