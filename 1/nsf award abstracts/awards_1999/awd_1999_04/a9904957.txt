Abstract    :
              The brain depends for its normal function on the specialized functional
              connections called synapses between nerve cells.  These highly specialized
              structures have a great variety of sizes and ultrastructural features of their
              membranes, and can utilize a variety of molecules as neurotransmitters to carry
              information from one cell to another.  This project uses as a model system a
              particular giant synapse in a visual-motor pathway, between a giant fiber and a
              motor neuron that is found in the central nervous system of the fruitfly,
              Drosophila; this organism also has a very well understood genetic background. 
              Physiological, anatomical, and molecular tools, along with mutations and
              transgenic approaches, will be used to examine the molecular basis for the
              assembly of this giant synapse during development.  The particular interest is
              in a molecular signal within the giant fiber that is carried back up the fiber
              to the cell nucleus, to regulate the formation of synaptic specializations.  

                 Results will be important for developmental biology as well as neuroscience,
              and the project will also train undergraduate and graduate students in
              neuroscience.
