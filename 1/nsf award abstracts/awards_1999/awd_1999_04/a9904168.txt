Abstract    :
              The PIs will test the production of hyperpycnal turbidity currents in a
              mountainous collision active margin setting.  Such turbidity currents could be
              generated more frequently than it is currently thought.  Sediment dispersal is
              governed by a decoupling process that divides the sediment plume into surface
              and bottom components, influenced by independent physical processes.  Surface
              component is influenced by wind, waves, tidal and coastal currents forming a
              positively buoyant, hypopycnal plume.  Bottom component is dominated by
              gravity, bottom morphology and boundary layer processes forming a negatively
              buoyant, hyperpycnal underflow.  If proved correct, it could demonstrate that
              hypopycnal/hyperpycnal processes are important in creating turbidity deposits. 
              The PIs will take water column measurements for hypopycnal processes, together
              with seabed monitoring.  They will attempt coring to study the deposits related
              to underflows at the mouth of the Sepik River, off Papua New Guinea.  The
              project is collaborative with Australian scientists.
