Abstract    :
              Research has shown that increased summertime temperatures in the polar regions
              have resulted in greater degradation of soil organic carbon than had occurred
              during previous colder times.  This effect could exacerbate global warming due
              to current greenhouse effect, but it could also be ameliorated by increased
              plant growth under warmer conditions.  The role of these two processes and the
              extent of their interaction is not currently known.  In order to help evaluate
              the current status of our understanding of these processes and to coordinate
              upcoming international investigations, an international conference, "How
              Nutrient Cycles Constrain Carbon Balances in Boreal forests and Arctic Tundra",
              will be held in Abisko Sweden.
