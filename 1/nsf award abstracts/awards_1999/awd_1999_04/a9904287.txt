	This project supports the dissertation research of
              an anthropology student from Emory University studying the political approaches
              and attitudes of Islamic Shia communities in Beirut, Lebanon.  The student will
              examine three institutional sites, an "Islamist" (fundamentalist), a
              nationalist, and a secular Shia community, to see how local conceptions of
              sectarianism (the dominant way local people view each other) affects their
              relation to the larger national community, to assess how these conceptions
              affect social agendas with regards to Lebanon's reconstruction, and to
              investigate the role of gender in these diverse groups.  The student will use
              participant-observation, archival research, surveys, extended case studies,
              semi-structured interviews, genealogical, narrative and  peer group interviews
              in a nationalist organization which runs over twenty elementary, secondary and
              vocational schools in the city, the Lebanese University in which many secular
              Shia faculty and students congregate, and an Islamist organization which runs
              over twenty schools, hospitals and orphanages in Lebanon, and which is linked
              to an international Shia network of mosques. In addition to furthering our
              understanding of how religious communities organize themselves in
              nation-building, the project supports the training of a young social scientist,
              and will inform discussions of the current political climate in the Middle
              East, as the Shia play a critical role in the rebuilding of Lebanon and the
              struggles for influence in the region.
