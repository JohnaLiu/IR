Abstract


A three-year research program is proposed for
              study of the interaction of out-of-plane bending and compression instability in
              unreinforced masonry (URM) compression members and post-tensioned masonry (PTM)
              walls with unrestrained tendons.  Axial compression instability is exacerbated
              by the presence of out-of-plane bending due to lateral loads, the most typical
              which arise from wind pressure and seismic loading.  The program includes the
              construction of twelve masonry walls that will be tested in axial compression
              and out-of-plane bending, as well as a comprehensive analytical effort.  Two
              types of tests are planned to verify and quantify the interaction between
              out-of-plane bending and axial compression instability in masonry walls.  Four
              masonry specimens comprising single-wythe walls in running bond will be loaded
              axially to buckling failure once a prescribed uniform lateral pressure is
              established.  The second group of four walls will be post-tensioned with
              unrestrained tendons, and will be loaded to failure in a simply-supported
              bending test setup featuring uniform lateral load.  The last four walls will be
              tested in the same manner as the second group, but will feature tendon
              restraint devices.  Experimental data analysis will be coupled with numerical
              analysis to define an accurate mathematical representation of this interaction,
              and experimental observations will be used for the development of design
              procedures.
