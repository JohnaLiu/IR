The goal of this research project is to demonstrate the
              capabilities of a new optical technique which was invented in the PI's
              laboratory, called coupled plasmon-waveguide resonance (CPWR) spectroscopy, to
              address the following important biophysical question. How do the properties of
              lipid bilayers modulate the functioning of integral membrane proteins in
              respiratory and photosynthetic energy transduction and in signal transduction,
              as a consequence of membrane-mediated interactions between components which
              actively influence their properties?  Experiments addressing this question will
              utilize reconstituted proteolipid membranes in which the lipid and protein
              compositions can be readily varied.  The goal is to investigate the
              significance and role of the following factors in controlling the anisotropic
              structure of a membrane and its functionality: (i) the incorporation of
              nonbilayer-forming lipids, (ii) hydrophobic matching between lipids and
              proteins, (iii) phospholipid polyunsaturation. The protein systems to be
              studied include the integral membrane proteins cytochrome b6f, and its
              physiological peripheral electron transfer partner, plastocyanin, and members
              of the superfamily of seven transmembrane helical G-protein linked receptors
              such as rhodopsin.  CPWR spectroscopy will be used to elucidate changes in the
              structural features of the proteolipid systems (film thickness; molecular
              orientation; mass and optical absorption anisotropies) during their
              functioning, and the thermodynamics of protein-protein and protein-lipid
              interactions.

It is anticipated that these experiments will provide new
              insights into the participation of lipids in interprotein electron transport in
              biomembrane-based energy conversion, and in the transfer of information across
              biological membranes from the external environment into the interior of cells
              and organelles.  This should have broad implications for all membrane-based
              biological processes, as well as for the development of future
              proteolipid-based technologies, such as molecular electronics, protein-based
              biosensors, and biomimetic energy conversion systems.
