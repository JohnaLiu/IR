Financial Support is requested to hold a small joint workshop in
              Quaternary science and geomorphology.  The workshop has its purpose, to assess
              the current state of both disciplinary areas, identify both the common and
              complementary nature of the questions the disciplines seek to answer, and
              identify some of the exciting new directions that can be tackled
              collaboratively as well as independently.  The final report will be submitted
              to the NSF and to the NAS/NRC Committee appointed by the Board on Earth
              Sciences and Resources to aid in the Committee's drafting of the NAS/NRC Study
              on Long Range Plan for EAR.
