Abstract    :
              This project has as its primary aim the synthesis of organic molecules that
              incorporate a variety of perfluorinated groups, including pentafluorothio and
              perfluoroalkyl.  New and unique fluorinated photopolymerizable synthons will be
              used to form durable polymer films and coatings in which the fluorinated
              components partition to the surface of the incipient film.  This has the
              potential to produce polymer films in which a fluorine-enriched overlayer is
              incorporated into an otherwise conventional polymer.  Once prepared, systematic
              structure - property relationships will be determined by photoelectron
              spectroscopy and infrared analysis;  and refractive index, dielectric constant
              and surface energies will also be measured.

With this Award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues support for the research of
              Professor Gary L. Gard of Portland State University, Portland, Oregon. 
              Professor Gard studies the variations in properties of fluorinated plastics as
              that plastic's constituent building blocks are themselves varied.  Fluorinated
              compounds such as those being investigated in Professor Gard's laboratory have
              found various applications such as solvents for polymers, perfluorinated blood
              substitutes, surface active agents, and as thermally and chemically stable
              monomers and polymers.
