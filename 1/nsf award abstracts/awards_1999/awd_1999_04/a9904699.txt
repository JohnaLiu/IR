Abstract    :
              PROJECT SUMMARY

The projects described in this Accomplishment-Based Renewal
              examine issues in the economics of the timing of activities and thus extend the
              PI's earlier research on the timing of market work. To every human activity is
              attached an index of when it occurs as well as how much of it is consumed and
              where it is accomplished. Timing can be expected to vary across individuals and
              internationally in ways that are predictable from differences in the value of
              time, marital status, and stages of the life cycle. This observation leads to
              the construction of models designed to examine such things as: The role of
              "start-up" costs and their implications for the incidence and duration of
              activities; the nature of "routine" and its variations across individuals and
              societies; the importance of marital sharing and the gains from marriage in the
              area of timing of activities.

In each case the behavior modifies our
              inferences about interhousehold differences in economic welfare. The project
              will analyze these and other aspects of timing using time-budget data from the
              U.S. and four other countries, with international comparisons wherever the data
              allow. The results will provide the first demographic accounting of the timing
              of activities. More importantly, they will allow testing hypotheses about time
              use in an instantaneous context, as opposed to the integrativecontext that has
              characterized all previous empirical work.
