Abstract    :
              This award is for the support of the second joint Workshop of Task Committee E
              of the US/Japan Cooperative Program in Natural Resources (UNJR).  The purpose
              of the second workshop are to: (a) continue to mutual exchange of information
              on ongoing wind engineering research; (b) encourage and extend the dialogue
              initiated previously on collaborative research areas; (c) focus and delineate
              specific projects for collaborative research; (d) visit selected research
              institutes and projects in Japan concerning wind effects on buildings and
              public works.  The workshop will be held in Tsukuba, Japan in late May 1999.
