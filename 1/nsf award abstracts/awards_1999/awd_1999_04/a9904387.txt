	This project supports the dissertation research of an
              anthropology student from Rutgers University studying the impacts of
              transnational media consumption on local cultures in China.  Based on the
              hypothesis that such media does not produce global cultural homogenization but
              rather consolidates local differences, this project will employ a multi-site
              ethnographic approach to study media, media-related commodities, and consumers
              in Beijing and Xian, China.  Using participant observation, semi-structured
              interviews, surveys and archival research, the student will analyze changes in
              local identities produced by exposure to transnational media, focusing on
              (foreign)  media consuming groups as distinct from (foreign) media dispossessed
              groups.  This research is important because it will produce a case study of a
              global process, the impact on local societies of the shift from local command
              economies to open market economies as influenced by changes in media,
              especially television, film, music, print media and video compact disks.  In
              addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist, and
              advances our knowledge of this important area of the world.
