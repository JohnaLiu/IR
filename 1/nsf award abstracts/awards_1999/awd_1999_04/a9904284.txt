We propose to measure the oxygen isotope composition of bones
              from modern endothermic (warm-blooded) and ectothermic (cold-blooded) species
              that occupy the same habitats in order to see if their different metabolisms
              can be distinguished isotopically.  The oxygen isotope values of coexisting
              bird, mammal and reptile bones coming from the same locality will be determined
              (samples are available from the University of New Mexico Biology Museum). 
              Isotopic differences will be modeled using known physiological factors.  Our
              ultimate goal is to use the oxygen isotope composition of extinct species
              (e.g., dinosaurs) to constrain their physiology.  The modern analogues --
              birds, mammals and reptiles --- will form the basis for our assessment of
              fossil species.
