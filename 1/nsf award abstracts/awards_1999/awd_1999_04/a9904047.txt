Dissolved organic matter biogeochemistry:
              Linking ecosystem processes, community structure and microbial dynamics in
              streams

The investigators in this research effort ask a simple, critical and
              little understood question in ecosystem studies: How do bacterial communities
              process dissolved organic matter in streams? To answer this question the PIs,
              including scientists and students from 5 institutions, will investigate: 1)
              what dissolved organic food resources and bacterial consumers are in a
              particular stream; 2) how the organic chemistry of the water and composition of
              the bacterial community respond to seasonal changes and other disturbances; 3)
              whether bacterial communities can process organic matter from different streams
              and habitats; and 4) how bacteria respond to changes in the quantity and
              quality of their food supply. This project bridges three disciplines:
              biogeochemistry, microbial ecology and ecological theory.  It also encompasses
              three distinct biomes: Eastern deciduous, Southern coniferous and Tropical
              evergreen.  Beyond contributions to our basic understanding of stream
              ecosystems and microbial ecology, this research has broad implications for the
              biological treatment of drinking waters and the remediation of organically
              polluted environments.
