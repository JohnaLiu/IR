ABSTRACT  

A number of studies have shown
              that the hippocampus, a region in the medial temporal lobes, is critical for
              learning and memory. Rats with lesions of the hippocampus are typically
              impaired on tasks that require spatial working memory. These deficits are also
              evident in rats with lesions of the fimbria-fornix, the major fiber bundle
              connecting the basal forebrain with the hippocampus. Selective lesions of basal
              forebrain cells that release acetylcholine into the hippocampus also impair
              spatial working memory. Although many studies have examined the influence of
              cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation in the hippocampus, little is known
              about the effects of cholinergic nicotinic receptor function in this region.
              This research will employ a combination of brain slice physiology and
              computational modeling to examine the effects of nicotinic receptor activation
              on cellular communication within different regions of the hippocampus. The
              biophysical data obtained from the physiological experiments will be
              incorporated into a previously developed model of this region. The model will
              be used to determine how the cellular/circuit effects of hippocampal nicotinic
              receptor activation provide mechanisms that support the behavioral memory tasks
              known to be sensitive to such modulation. The model will also generate
              predictions concerning the effects of nicotinic receptor activation on
              population rhythms in the hippocampus and how they may contribute to working
              memory in general.
