Most traits of medical, physiological, or ecological
              importance are influenced by many genetic and many environmental factors.
              Quantitative genetics seeks to unravel the importance of the different factors
              by decomposing the resemblance of relatives into genetic and environmental
              components.  Traditional quantitative genetics involves controlled breeding
              coupled with careful phenotypic measurements in common or controlled
              environments.  For most organisms, including humans and the vast majority of
              natural biological resources, these techniques are impossible because of
              technical, ethical, or resource limitations.  Consequently, application of
              quantitative genetics to a diversity of organisms is severely limited.  This
              project seeks to overcome such limitations by developing statistical methods to
              integrate molecular and phenotypic data, thereby differentiating among the
              genetic and environmental factors affecting quantitative traits.  A robust and
              flexible set of software will be developed to implement
the statistical
              methods so that they will be widely accessible.  This project lays the
              statistical foundation for a much more general means of estimating the
              quantitative effects of genes in natural populations than exists to date, and
              produces software to make its application
practical.

A number of future
              studies will be enabled by this project such as nondestructive samples from
              populations of rare or endangered species.  Analysis and elucidation of
              complex, multifactorial diseases will be aided by broad population samples and
              integration of molecular genetic and phenotypic data from natural human
              populations.
