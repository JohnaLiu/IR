The Center for Science and the Media is requesting
              $2,006,069, of a total budget of $5,597,518, to develop the Science and
              Technology News Network (STN2) that will produce science news segments to be
              used by local television stations in their news programs.   The products
              delivered to the stations will include 90-second video news stories in two
              versions -- with and without voice-over; scripts that local newscasters can
              read on air; topical and regional tips sheets to help producers localize the
              stories;  follow-up research and one-on-one support by the project staff;
              explanatory or science-angle sidebars; web stories to introduce upcoming TV
              stories and provide more in-depth coverage; and Internet support with resources
              important to local TV producers.   The project also provides content to the
              abcnews.com science site and to ABC News One, the network affiliate news
              service.  The science modules will produce segments in both English and
              Spanish. 

The PI and General Manager for the project is Eliene Augenbraun, a
              former research scientist with experience in management and media.  The News
              Director and Co-PI is Ira Flatow.  They will work with an advisory committee of
              scientists and science journalists.
