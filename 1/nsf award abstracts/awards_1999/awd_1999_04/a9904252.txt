Abstract    :
              This research aims to estimate of the maternal contribution of Caucasians,
              Sub-Saharan Africans and Native Americans to the human gene pool in various
              geographic regions of Puerto Rico.  The history of Puerto Rico strongly
              suggests that intense genetic admixture has occurred continuously since the
              Spanish colonization commenced in 1508.  The genetic admixture has been
              characterized by a sexual asymmetry in which the male component is commonly
              represented by Caucasians while the female component is represented by
              Sub-Saharan Africans or Native Americans.  However, little can be deduced from
              history about the sexual balance of Native American and Sub-Saharan African
              mixed couples, or the degree of inbreeding within each ethnic group. 
              Furthermore, recent mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) experiments suggest that aspects
              of the genetic contribution of ethnic groups among various geographic regions
              in Puerto Rico may have been overlooked. This will be especially meaningful in
              light of the claimed identity crisis suffered by Puerto Ricans and by their
              special political relationship with the United States.  The aim will be
              attained by the haplogroup identification of 640 mtDNAs representative of
              various geographic regions of Puerto Rico.  The haplogroup of 96 to 100% of the
              mtDNAs will be identified through restriction fragment length polymorphism
              (RFLP).  The rest will be identified by DNA sequencing of the HV-1 region. 
              Because of the high continent-specificity of the haplogroups, the biological
              origin of those mtDNAs whose haplogroup will be identified will be determined
              in 100% of the Native Americans, 97.1% of the Sub-Saharan Africans and 94.6% of
              the Caucasians.

In addition this research will allow the training of a
              number of undergraduate students at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez in a
              variety of techniques currently employed in molecular anthropology research.
