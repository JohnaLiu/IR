Abstract    :
              The proposed project involves an electrophysiological investigation of
              two
types of locomotory speed changes in the pteropod mollusk Clione
              limacina.
Clione exhibits both a dramatic speed change, analogous to a gait
              change in
higher animals, and a more subtle speed change, equivalent to a
              change in
speed within a single gait.  Since the nervous system of Clione
              is
relatively simple, we can investigate these speed changes at a level
              not
allowed in higher animals.  This model system should provide
              background
information on the reorganization of central circuitry in
              rhythmic
locomotory systems that allows increases in the frequency and
              strength of
locomotory movements.  We will use a variety of techniques,
              including
electrophysiological recordings of identified neurons, force
              recordings
from the locomotory  musculature and immunohistochemical
              identification of
neurons that release serotonin, a prime modulator that
              differentially
triggers the two types of speed changes in Clione.
	Basic
              research of this type uncovers "rules" of how rhythmic behaviors are
organized
              at the circuit and cellular levels, and how variability in these
behaviors is
              achieved by various types of sensory inputs.  These rules can
be used in
              investigations of rhythmic behaviors in higher, more complex
animals.  In
              addition, investigation of simple model locomotory systems
provides useful
              information for the fields of robotics and
computer-assisted muscle
              stimulation in para- and quadriplegics.
