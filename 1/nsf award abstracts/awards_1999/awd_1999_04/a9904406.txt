Abstract    :
                 This conference on biology and chemistry of vision is one of an annual
              series.  Research on vision has, more than any other sensory system, involved
              great participation of different disciplines from molecular biology through
              psychology.  Advances in the biology of vision are very broadly interesting and
              relevant to fields such as development, molecular biology, protein structure,
              and signal transduction, as well as health.  This year there will be continued
              coverage of the rapidly progressing story of how proteins are involved in the
              phototransduction cascade, and how genetics can clarify photoreceptor function.
               The sessions are organized around questions instead of techniques, and this
              year there will be expanded discussion on photoreceptor adaptation and
              inactivation, and on the results from cross-disciplinary collaborations.
  
              The impact on visual science will come from the close interactions across
              different approaches presented at this conference.  Added impact comes from
              integrating young investigators into discussions with leaders in the field, to
              have an impact on their careers.
