Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for fiscal
              year 1999 for research and training in the area of animal behavior.  

The
              research and training plan is entitled "Climatological effects of near-field
              recognition of mates in the North American field cricket, Gryllus
              pennsylvanicus."  The research is addressing the proximate factors affecting
              the evolution of mate choice and other behaviorally complex reproductive
              systems in insects.  The split-family, half-sib design will reveal the nature
              of male courtship song and epicuticular hydrocarbon profiles that facilitate
              mate recognition and will also estimate heritability of courtship song and mate
              choice. This study integrates the roles of development, seasonal effects on
              epicuticular hydrocarbons, physical contact, and acoustic cues in insects that
              use acoustic and chemotactile mating cues.
