Abstract    :
              This ESH award will support an Accomplishment-Based Renewal to study a suite of
              ODP cores from the Southern California margin, focusing, on records of
              millenial variability in ocean circulation and climae.  Stuble isotopes and
              census counts of benthic and planktic forminiferal assemblages will be used to
              test hypotheses concrning the relative roles of productivity and ventilation by
              Pacific Intermediate Water in controlling the intensity and extent of the
              oxygen miniumum zone.
