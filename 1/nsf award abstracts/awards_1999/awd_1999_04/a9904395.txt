Abstract    :
              This grant provides the funding resources for undergraduate under-represented
              students to present a scientific poster of coastal ocean research they were
              involved in at the Estuarine Research Federation's 1999 meeting (ERF99). This
              meeting is the preeminent gathering of scientists, governmental resource
              managers and educators concerned with estuaries and occurs every 2 years.
              Selected students are paired with mentors (established individuals in estuarine
              research and studies) and gather as a group to discuss, share and ensure an
              educationally distinctive and rewarding learning experience through each day's
              events.  The long range goals of this effort is to increase minority
              involvement in near-coastal research, management and policy through early
              attraction of undergraduate students into these fields.
