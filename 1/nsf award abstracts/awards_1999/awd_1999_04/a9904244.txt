	This project supports the dissertation research of an
              anthropology student from Columbia University studying concepts and practices
              concerning the ideal expression of Muslim religious citizenship.  The student
              will study mosque construction in neighborhoods of Lahore, Pakistan, examining
              the role state planning has played in promoting urban mosques, and the
              religious-political controversies over building practices and mosque
              architecture.  The student will conduct an archival study of mosque
              construction since 1947, a survey of new mosques in planned urban
              neighborhoods, and an ethnographic study of mosques in various neighborhoods of
              the city, to show how people understand and act upon ideological debates and
              conflicts over Muslim citizenship. This research will advance our understanding
              of how diverse sects of Muslims interpret their religion through the central
              site of their practice, the mosque.  This understanding will be relevant to
              understanding Muslim culture in other countries, as well as be pertinent to
              understand the forms of religious-ethnic conflict in other societies.  In
              addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist, and
              advances our knowledge of this important area of the world.
