This award supports Gopal Gupta and his students from the New
              Mexico State University in a collaboration with Neil Jones of the Department of
              Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark and with Michael
              Leuschel of the Department of Electronics and Computer Science at the
              University of Southampton, England.  The research will focus on obtaining
              provably correct, declarative frameworks for language compilation and
              translation, automatic verification, semantic porting, and software engineering
              using Horn logic.  There are already examples of the power and ease of use of
              logical semantics with Horn logic semantics-this project will support
              large-scale experiments that will result in direct benefits to the end users of
              software applications.
