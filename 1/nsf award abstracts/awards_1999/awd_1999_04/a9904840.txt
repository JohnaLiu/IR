Abstract    :
              The persistence and widespread occurrence of cross-fertilization is widely
              recognized as one of the most interesting challenges for the theory of
              evolution by natural selection.  One promising theory is that, by creating
              genetically variable progeny, cross-fertilization is favored as a way to reduce
              the risk of infection by parasites that evolve to attack common host genotypes.
               Here we test some important predictions and assumptions of this theory.  The
              specific objectives are five fold: (1) to determine whether parasites can
              evolve under laboratory conditions to infect individual host genotypes, and
              whether such a response entails a trade-off in ability to infect other host
              genotypes; (2) to create and experimentally infect hybrid snails to determine
              the genetic basis of infection; (3) to extend a seven-year study of the
              evolutionary dynamics of host genotypes and their infection by parasites in a
              natural population; (4) to measure the rate of  mutation accumulation as a test
              of an alternative theory that cross fertilization helps eliminate harmful
              mutations; and (5) to provide a direct experimental test of the parasite
              hypothesis.  The results will be of interest to epidemiologists, crop plant
              pathologists, and conservation biologists interested in the interplay between
              host genetic diversity and the effects of coevolving parasites and pathogens. 
              The results will also be of wide interest to evolutionary biologists interested
              in the effects of natural selection on the reproductive strategies of plants
              and animals.
