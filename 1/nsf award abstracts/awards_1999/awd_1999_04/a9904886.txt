              Lay Summary

Specificity and Function in Neural Endopeptidases.

Small
              peptide molecules help to carry information in the nervous system, regulate
              neural activity, and alter the function of other tissues outside the nervous
              system. The goal of this study is to understand how enzymes that control the
              levels of these neuropeptides function -how they recognize their target
              molecules, how they act to cleave them into smaller pieces, and how they avoid
              attacking inappropriately the many other molecules present. We will combine two
              approaches to the problem. First, we will use x-ray techniques to provide a
              detailed, three-dimensional picture of one such enzyme known as endopeptidase
              24.16. From this structure of endopeptidase 24.16, we will be able to visualize
              how the enzyme might bind to and cleave its target peptides. Second, we will
              use biochemical approaches to better define the characteristics of a good
              target for endopeptidase 24.16. Ultimately, the information obtained from these
              studies will add to our ability to engineer proteins for specific tasks.
