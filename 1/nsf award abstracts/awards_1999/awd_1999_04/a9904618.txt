Photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) from Rhodobacter
              sphaeroides will be modified by mutations of ionizable amino acids on either
              side of the initial electron donor (P).  Arginines L135 and M164, Tyr L164, and
              Glu M173 will be replaced by residues that are neutral or have an opposite
              charge, and the effects on spectroscopic properties, the midpoint redox
              potential of P, and the charge-separation kinetics will be measured.  Computer
              models will be used to predict the effects of the mutations and
              molecular-dynamics simulations will be used to study relaxations of the
              transient states created by electron transfer. The LH1 and LH2 antenna
              complexes from Rb. sphaeroides will be studied by both experimental and
              computational approaches. Excited antenna complexes undergo relaxations and
              loss of electronic coherence on the time scale 30-100 fs. The dynamics of these
              processes will be examined as functions of temperature by femtosecond
              pump-probe techniques and computer simulations.

This project seeks to
              improve understanding of how photosynthetic organisms capture the energy of
              sunlight. The work focuses on pigment-protein complexes found in photosynthetic
              bacteria. Antenna complexes absorb light and transfer energy to reaction
              centers (RCs), where a series of electron-transfer reactions occur. The
              kinetics of electron transfer and other properties of the RCs will be measured
              in mutant bacteria with the aim of clarifying how interactions of the pigments
              with the protein affect the absorption spectrum and determine the rate,
              temperature dependence and specificity of electron transfer. Computer
              simulations will be used to select key amino acid residues for mutation and to
              relate the experimental results to the protein structures.  Fast relaxations
              and energy-transfer processes also will be measured in antenna complexes.
