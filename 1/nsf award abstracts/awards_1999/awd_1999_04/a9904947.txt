Abstract    :
              This collaborative proposal supports a project to perform stable isotope
              analyses of samples collected along the International Trans-Antarctic
              Scientific Expedition (ITASE) traverses which will begin during the
1999/2000
              Antarctic field season.  This work will focus on the spatial and temporal
              distribution of oxygen-18 and deuterium in West Antarctica (where data are
              particularly sparse) and the calibration of the isotope-climate relationship on
              a site-by-site basis, using instrumental and remote-sensing temperature
              histories.  Specific objectives of this work which contribute to ITASE are: 1)
              to obtain detailed oxygen-18, deuterium and deuterium excess and stratigraphic
              histories in snowpits at most or all of the ITASE coring sites; 2) to provide
              direct calibration of the isotope-climate relationship at each site through a
              combination of direct (AWS) and indirect (passive microwave satellite)
              temperature measurements; 3) to obtain isotope profiles covering the last 200
              years;  and 4) to use the results to provide 200-year climate histories at high
              temporal and broad spatial resolution across West Antarctica that will allow
              testing of proposed relationships among isotopes, moisture source conditions,
              synoptic scale climatology, and site-specific meteorological parameters, and
              which will enhance our ability to interpret isotope records from older and
              deeper Antarctic ice cores.
