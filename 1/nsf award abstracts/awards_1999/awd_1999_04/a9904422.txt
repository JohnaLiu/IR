This project is directed at examining the contribution of
              backbone conformational entropy to the total entropy change observed on
              oxidation of heme proteins.  NMR relaxation experiments will be carried out to
              characterize backbone dynamics and voltametric methods will be used to
              determine the temperature dependence of the reduction potential.  It has been
              shown that redox linked changes in backbone dynamics contribute significantly
              to the total entropy change observed on oxidation of cytochrome b5.  The origin
              of differences in backbone dynamics can be linked to redox linked changes in
              hydrogen bond strengths based on enormous differences in deuterium exchange
              rates observed between amide protons in the two relevant oxidation states.   
              The combined use of molecular dynamics trajectories and 13C relaxation rates
              should enable a more accurate characterization of the dynamic properties of the
              heme proteins. 

The primary focus of the work involves delineation of
              thermodynamic contributors to the electromotive driving force involved in heme
              protein electron transfer reactions.  NMR solution methods will be used to
              quantitate at atomic resolution changes in protein dynamics which can in turn
              be related to protein conformational entropy contributions to the electromotive
              driving force.  The ability to modulate these redox linked changes in backbone
              dynamics mutagenically or through the addition of exogenous high binding
              affinity ligands may be useful in the engineering of heme proteins with
              specific electrochemical properties.  Potential applications lie in the areas
              of electrochemical biosensors and industrial biotransformations.
