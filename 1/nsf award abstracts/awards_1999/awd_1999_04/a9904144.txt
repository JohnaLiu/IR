Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of animal physiology and
              behavior and is entitled "Hormonal and environmental regulation of reproductive
              function and territoriality in a bird inhabiting a temperate equatorial
              environment."  This study investigates the control of reproduction and
              territoriality in an equatorial population of the rufous sparrow, Zonotrichia
              capensis.  Mating pairs exhibit synchronized reproductive cycles while the
              population displays aseasonal reproduction.  The environmental and hormonal
              cues that the pairs use to synchronize reproduction are being determined.
