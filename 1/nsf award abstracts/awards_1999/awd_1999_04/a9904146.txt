Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of plant developmental
              biology and is entitled "The role of the HASTY Gene in Shoot Maturation."  The
              regulation of developmental phase change in Arabidopsis is being studied using
              a genetic mutant, HASTY, which accelerates the transformation from the juvenile
              to the adult vegetative phase.  Using several methods, the transcription and
              translation patterns of HASTY in various plant tissues will be investigated in
              order to gain insight into its function.
