	This project supports the dissertation research
              of an anthropology student from Stanford University studying the
              nationalistic/ethnic antagonism between Macedonians and Albanians in Macedonia.
              The student, a native Macedonian speaker, will examine the ethnic identity of
              both groups through a study of the home furnishings preferred by each.  Using
              in-depth ethnographic research on a small sample of households followed by an
              extensive survey of 180 households, 90 from each nationality, the student will
              examine the change from the pre-1991 Communist Yugoslav Federation to the
              current Macedonian situation.  Anti-Albanian nationalism is currently a strong
              force in the region, and this study will help reveal the cultural roots of the
              antagonism by comparing the previous condition under which both groups lived
              peacefully, subjected to a dominant Communist ideology which focused on
              cross-cutting class differences and working class solidarity, to the current
              situation which separates people by culture and religion (Orthodox versus
              Muslim). The student will test the hypothesis that home furnishings were not
              that different in the pre 1991 condition, but difference flourished afterwards
              as the ethnic tensions became free to grow.  This project is important because
              it will advance our understanding of the meanings of nationalist/ethnic
              antagonism in this one case, which is comparable to many other situations in
              the post-Communist world.  In addition the project supports the training of a
              young social scientist.
