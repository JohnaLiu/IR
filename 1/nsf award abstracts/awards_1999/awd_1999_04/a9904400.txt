	This award provides funding support for the operation of a
              new large-radius ion microprobe facility at Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution. The facility will be operated as a national facility open to
              qualified researchers who need the special capabilities of this instrument,
              e.g., precise trace element and isotopic analyses combined with spatial
              resolution of sampling on the order of approximately 10 microns. Research
              applications by the Woods Hole hosts and the U.S. earth science research
              community is expected to include studies of mantle geochemistry, oceanic
              volcanism, island arc volcanism, geochronology, and biogenic carbonates.
