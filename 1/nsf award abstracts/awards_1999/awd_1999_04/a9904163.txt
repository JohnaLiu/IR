Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of animal developmental
              biology and is entitled "Role of growth factor signaling in kidney tubule
              development in the mouse."  The role of Wnt and FGF are being elucidated in
              signaling in nephron morphogenesis.  Time-lapse microscopy is being performed
              on cultured mouse embryonic kidney explants overexpressing green fluorescent
              protein-tagged components of the Wnt and FGF signaling pathways.  Modulation of
              Wnt and FGF signaling will be correlated with alterations in cellular structure
              and movement.
