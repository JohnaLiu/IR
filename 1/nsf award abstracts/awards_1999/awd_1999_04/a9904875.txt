The objective of this research is to study
              protein dynamics by NMR and computational approaches. Detailed information on
              dynamics is highly relevant for understanding the function of proteins at an
              atomic level. Such information will be gained from nuclear spin auto-and
              cross-correlated relaxation measurements of uniformly labeled proteins,
              including ubiquitin and a transcription factor under various chemical
              conditions and at different magnetic fields. Interpretation of the data will
              focus on internal and overall motional anisotropy effects and correlated
              dynamics.  Analytical and semi-empirical models will be derived from extended
              molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations. Density functional theory (DFT)
              will be applied to time series of MD snapshots for the quantum-mechanical
              
determination of the strengths and orientations of the relaxation-active spin
              interactions which are crucial for NMR relaxation data interpretation.
              

Understanding protein dynamics is of fundamental importance for many
              biochemical events, including molecular recognition. The overall goal of this
              research is to develop new methods for a realistic, accurate, and yet
              comprehensible description of complex protein dynamics in solution and their
              application to biologically relevant systems.
