This three-year award supports US-UK collaborative research in
              materials science between Karen Winey at the University of Pennsylvania and
              Anthony J. Ryan of the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom.  The
              research explores the creation and relaxation of defects in a series of soft,
              layered materials.  In particular, it addresses an apparent lack of
              universality, namely that block copolymers (layered materials having short
              relaxation times) form focal conic defects.

The US researcher brings to this
              collaboration expertise in imaging and defects using electron microscopy.  This
              is complemented by the British researcher's expertise of in-situ
              characterization of materials using synchrotron sources.  The collaboration
              provides access to unique model diblock copolymers developed by the British
              research group and access to world class synchrotron sources - the Daresbury
              facility in the United Kingdom and the European Synchrotron Research Facility
              in Grenoble, France.
