              ABSTRACT

CTS-9904327  ZVI RUSAK   

The goal of this effort is the
              development of an experimentally verified model for the dynamics of combustion
              states with swirling flows and to provide an understanding of the physical
              mechanisms leading to instabilities in lean, premixed combustion systems. 
              Analyses combine classical asymptotic approaches with modern tools from
              functional analysis, dynamical system theory, and the theory of nonlinear
              partial differential equations.  Emphasis is on combustion and flow conditions
              for which bifurcations  may occur and where small- or large-amplitude
              instabilities may evolve.  Boundary conditions are taken from experimental
              observations.  Extensive numerical computations are conducted, in particular of
              the far-from bifurcation behavior of the system.  Theoretical and numerical
              results are compared with data from Louisiana State University for model and
              code validation, and from prediction of instabilities or transients that affect
              the combustion process.

Instabilities that develop in lean, premixed
              combustion systems with swirl present severe design limitations in modern,
              low-emission systems, especially when vortex breakdown is exploited to
              stabilize the flame and enhance combustion efficiency.
