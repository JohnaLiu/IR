Abstract    :
              



This proposal describes a simulation and modeling research program aimed
              at studying the properties of azetropic distillation columns with internal
              decanters.  These columns are sensitive to operating conditions, exhibit phase
              splitting on various trays and show multiple steady state behavior.  The
              proposed work addresses steady-state issues in these column designs using
              homotopy-continuation mathematical techniques which will be incorporated into a
              software package for analyzing these systems.  Another simulation aspect of the
              research will focus upon dynamic studies using software packages, calculating
              time constants and other quanitities like right-half plane zeros which
              influence the choice of control system design.
