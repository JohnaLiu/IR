Abstract    :
              The Enzyme Engineering Conference is the longest, continuous conference series
              that is sponsored by the Engineering Foundation. The first meeting was held in
              New Hampshire in 1971 and every other year thereafter. The meetings alternate
              between domestic and foreign locales. The conferences are generally attended by
              150-200 world leaders in enzyme engineering research. Over half of the speakers
              are from foreign nations. The emphasis of the 1999 conference has been placed
              on "directed evolution approaches for biocatalyst improvement and on the use of
              biocatalysis in the chemical industry."  Among the key sessions planned
              are:
Biodiversity/new enzyme discovery
Directed enzyme evolution
Advances in
              enzyme design
Enzyme based processes in the chemical industry
New
              biotransformations
Combinatorial biocatalysis/pathway engineering
New
              developments

The conference will provide an excellent opportunity for U.S.
              researchers to network with foreign scientists in the field, many of whom come
              from countries with extensive enzyme-use history.
