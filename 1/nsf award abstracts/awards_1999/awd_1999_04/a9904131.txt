	This project supports the dissertation research
              of an anthropology student from Princeton University studying contemporary
              notions of personhood in highland Papua New Guinea.  The project uses an
              ethnographic examination of the meanings of male initiation practices among
              speakers of BenaBena to understand how local people understand morality, the
              life course, and native theories of the physiological constitution of persons
              and procreation.  The project will analyze how market capitalism, Christianity
              and the ideology of the nation-state have been exported to these small-scale,
              kinship-based societies, and how this export has affected the cultural
              definition of the role of individuals in social groups. The methods will
              include classical ethnographic participant observation, genealogies, taped
              interviews, and a census of the community.  The student will study these issues
              in a range of villages undergoing different experiences of contact with markets
              and urban society.  The project supports the training of a young social
              scientist, and advances our knowledge of this important area of the world.
