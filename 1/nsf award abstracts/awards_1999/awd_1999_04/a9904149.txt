Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of biophysics and is
              entitled "A new biological oxygen sensor from E. coli."  A new oxygen-detection
              protein has been discovered in E. coli.  One of its domains contains heme and
              is related to the oxygen-sensing domains of the rhizobial FixL.  Another one of
              its domains is related to a family of DNA-binding proteins.  These experiments
              are investigating the mechanism of oxygen sensing by this protein.
