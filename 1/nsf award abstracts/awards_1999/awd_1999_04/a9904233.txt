This US-Brazil award supports dissertation enhancement
              collaborative research between Dr. Philip S. Ward and his co-PI Sean G. Brady,
              University of CalIfornia and Dr. Carlos Roberto F. Brandao, University of San
              Paulo, San Paulo, Brazil. They will conduct a two-year dissertation enhancement
              study on the origin and evolution of army ants (hymenoptera formicidae).
              

The principal goal of this research is to test the hypothesis that the army
              ant syndrome evolved convergently on separate continents; to test whether
              patterns of diversification correspond to sequences of continental
              fragmentation and reconnection; and to analyze evolutionary patterns and
              processes of army ant foraging behavior, migration and eye morphology.
