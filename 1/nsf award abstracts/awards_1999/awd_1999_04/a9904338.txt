Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              of the Chemistry Division is made to Dr. Ziling (Ben) Xue of the Chemistry
              Department of the University of Tennesseee, Knoxville, to study reactions of
              silanes with coordinated amides, alkyls, alkylidenes and alkylidynes in
              inorganic and organometallic compounds so as (i) to elucidate the nature of the
              reactions and the mechanistic pathways in the preparation of metal silicides,
              (ii) to synthesize new transition-metal silicon derivatives with these ligands,
              and (iii) to develop novel chemical vapor deposition processes to fabricate
              metal silicides.

In addition to the development of chemical vapor deposition
              processes, metal clusters that possess the structural features of metal
              silicides will be prepared to gain insights that will lead to better designs of
              molecular routes to existing and new silicide-based solid-state materials.
              These materials are important components in very-large-scale-integration
              devices, and in high-temperature and infrared detector systems. Students and
              post-doctoral associates will be trained in synthetic chemistry and materials
              science in an environment of expertise and state-of-the-art facilities that
              will foster and enhance collaboration between the University of Tennessee at
              Knoxville and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
