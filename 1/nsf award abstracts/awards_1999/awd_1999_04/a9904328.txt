The Hussain proposal
              combines a fundamental investigation of a basic process in fluid dynamics: --
              the viscous modification of the field of vorticity filaments associated with i)
              colliding rings and ii) an elliptical ring -- with the development of an
              advanced measurement technique: holographic particle velocimetry.

The fluid
              mechanics aspects will have an impact on the processes which are responsible,
              for example, for fine scale mixing (of intrinsic importance in non-premixed
              combustion, etc.) and dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy.  The proposed
              efforts, to further develop HPV, will bring a significant advancement in this
              unique method to gain an instantaneous snapshot of a flow field.  The proposer
              and his colleagues have pioneered in the initial development efforts and he is
              distinctly well suited to pursue this further capability.

It is noteworthy
              that the proposer will combine, in this integrated activity, research paths
              that are of recognized importance in Fluid Dynamics and for which he has been
              one of the principal pioneers, viz., the evolution of concentrated fields of
              vorticity.

The parallel (and independently funded) numerical simulations of
              this flow constitute a very important aspect of the investigation's
              contribution.  The potential difficulties in these computations derive from
              quite different attributes when compared with those faced by the
              experimentalists.   Hence, using the two bodies of results in a comparative
              manner will be of significant importance in isolating/identifying errors and
              limitations that may characterize each of the separate approaches.
