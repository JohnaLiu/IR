	This project supports the dissertation research of
              an anthropology student from the University of Florida, studying the
              ethnobotanical knowledge of Amerindians in the Bolivian lowlands.  The student
              will examine the influence of market activity on the distribution of
              ethnobotanical knowledge, hypothesizing that knowledge will be less widely
              shared in communities more exposed to the market because of greater
              specialization in economic activities and lesser use of plants.  The student
              will test the idea in three Tsimane Indian communities with different degrees
              of market exposure.  Data on ethnobotanical knowledge will be collected through
              triads, rank order and multiple-choice tests.  In addition the student will
              carry out biweekly interviews of plant use, monthly income surveys, and
              quarterly wealth surveys of the same individuals over a year to build a panel
              set of data on important variables that covary with knowledge.  Cultural
              consensus analysis will be used to create scores on agreement on ethnobotanical
              knowledge, which (scores) will then be used as dependent variables to run
              multivariate analysis with economic, social and demographic variables.  This
              research will be one of the first rigorous quantitative research to link
              cognitive outcomes with economic variables. In addition the project supports
              the training of a young social scientist, and advances our knowledge of this
              important area of the world.
