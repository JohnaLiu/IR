ABSTRACT

This award to the Entomological Society of
              America (ESA) provides partial support for US scientists to attend the XXI
              International Congress of Entomology August 20-26, 2000 in Iguassu Falls,
              Brazil. The International Congresses, which are held every four years, provide
              the opportunity for the international entomological research community to
              exchange information, consolidate advances, foster collaboration, and plan for
              the future. It also provides a venue for scientists and especially for graduate
              students to internationalize their research programs. The ESA will disburse the
              funds through a competitive application procedure, which will be open to all US
              researchers with special preference given to students and junior scientists.
              This award to the ESA will help ensure that US scientists continue to actively
              participate in the international entomological community.
