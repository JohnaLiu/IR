This grant is for $4,000 to support the Gordon Research
              Conference on Dry Corrosion to be held at New London, NH, on July 18-23, 1999. 
              The conference emphasis is on current research in the field of high temperature
              corrosion under aggressive conditions.  Issues to be considered are stresses
              developed in oxidation, subsurface zone depletion, thermal barrier coatings,
              carbon/carbon composites and special effects in oxidation and oxidation as a
              production tool.  A retrospective of high temperature corrosion research in the
              20th century and a panel discussion on future research directions in the field
              is planned.  The budget requested from NSF goes towards support of graduate
              students, post-doctorates and speakers.  Many foreign scientists have been
              invited to share their views on the subject.

Dry corrosion is an active
              research area with direct relevance to industrial needs.  Both ceramic and
              metallic materials are covered in these sessions.  Recent advances in
              understanding oxidation resistance in materials contributes to improved high
              temperature life of many components.  In some cases oxidation is used to
              improve functionality of materials, such as for producing insulating
              layers.
