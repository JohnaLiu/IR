Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of biochemistry and is
              entitled "Chemical control of serine protease zymogen activation."  Zymogens
              are inactive precursors of enzymes which undergo specific intermolecular
              proteolytic cleavage and metal chelation to form pre-enzymes and enzymes. 
              Molecular modeling and molecular biological techniques are being used to
              eluclidate the steps of zymogen formation and activation leading to the
              important digestive, protein-cleaving enzyme trypsin.
