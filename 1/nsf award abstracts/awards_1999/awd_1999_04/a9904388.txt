	This project supports the dissertation research of
              an anthropology student from the University of Texas, studying the role of
              language attitudes and orthographic practices in the creation, negotiation and
              maintenance of socio-cultural and geopolitical relations between Turkey and
              Azerbaijan, a Turkish speaking republic on Central Asia.  The student will show
              how ethnic, religious, linguistic historic, cultural, religious, and scholarly
              affiliations are expressed and negotiated in debates over language and
              communication.  In particular the project will study the arguments over the
              establishment of a common Turkish language and alphabet, two supranational
              projects designed by Turkish scholars to unite the Turkish peoples under a
              common rubric of linguistic identity.  Combining theories and methods from
              discourse analysis of language and culture, the student will analyze tapes of
              conferences on establishing a pan-Turkish language, will interview scholars,
              politicians, business persons, as well as private citizens in Turkey and
              Azerbaijan. In addition to analyzing recordings and conducting formal
              interviews, the student will use a matched-guise method, where tape recordings
              of bilingual speakers reading the same text in two languages will be used to
              elicit unconscious attitudes towards languages and peoples who speak them. 
              This project will provide important new knowledge about the attitudes of
              Turkish speaking Muslims on an issue of national relevance, that will be useful
              to scholars of comparable situations in Central Asia as well as other parts of
              the world.  In addition the project supports the training of a young social
              scientist, and advances our knowledge of this important area of the world.
