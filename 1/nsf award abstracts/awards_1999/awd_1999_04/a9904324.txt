SPECIAL
              PROJECT:  INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON VIRTUAL WORLDS 
AND SIMULATION

Over
              the last four years,  new advances have been made in creating collaborative
              Virtual places,  popular with both intelligent agents and human players.  These
              virtual worlds make use of simulations to create the collaborative environment
              or virtual world,  along with its objects and agents.  New applications of
              these technologies are appearing in fields as diverse as business, 
              manufacturing and design,  medicine,  education,  and training.  This award
              provides support for university attendance at a conference to exchange new
              ideas for advancing the use of virtual worlds in different fields of
              application.
