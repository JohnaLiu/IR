Abstract    :
              This Post-Doctoral Research project revisits the issue of whether market prices
              are higher for food in low-income neighborhoods by analyzing current and
              historical unpublished price level data collected by the Bureau of Labor
              Statistics for use in compiling the Consumer Price Index. The researcher will
              examine whether price differences between low and upper-income neighborhoods
              have changed over time by analyzing historical price data. The project will
              test whether there has been significant changes in pricing strategies toward
              the low-income consumer and analyze how these pricing strategies have evolved
              with the change in neighborhood demography over time. In a second project to be
              completed during the fellowship tenure, the researcher will derive a low-income
              price index to study whether inflation differentially affects the poor.
              Finally, the researcher will replicate Chevalier (1995) to analyze whether
              highly leveraged supermarkets charge higher prices.
