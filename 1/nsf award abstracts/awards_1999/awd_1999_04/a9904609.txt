	The genes of
              the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) encode proteins that play a central
              role in the immune response.  Therefore these genes influence resistance to
              infectious and autoimmune diseases.  Interestingly, evidence indicates that
              house mice (and probably humans) prefer to mate with individuals carrying MHC
              genes that are different from their own. MHC-dissimilar mating preferences in
              house mice and other vertebrates might function to reduce inbreeding or to
              produce immunologically diverse offspring with greater resistance to infectious
              disease.  Dr. Potts and Dr. Penn will conduct research  directed at testing
              both these questions:  (1) Which specific genes within the MHC region are
              responsible for the observed mating preferences.  (2) Do MHC genes influence
              odors that can be discriminated by house mice without training?  (3) Do house
              mice recognize MHC-dissimilarity by comparison to their own MHC type, or by
              comparison to that of their nestmates?  (4) Do MHC-dissimilar mating
              preferences function to slow down the rate at which parasites can adapt to
              their hosts' immune systems? 
	This research on MHC mediated behaviors has
              several important implications. It will help to clarify some of the most
              intriguing problems in animal behavior, such as how genes influence complex
              social behaviors and how mating preferences enhance the ability of offspring to
              resist disease.  Moreover, our work will have important implications for
              understanding the genetics and development of chemosensory (odor) communication
              and the selective forces maintaining genetic diversity.
