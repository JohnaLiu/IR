	This project supports the dissertation research of
              an anthropology student from the University of Florida, studying international
              labor migration from Brazil to Japan.  The project will test Massey's theory
              that a migrant flow between two countries tends to become self-sustaining
              independent of the original structural factors that initiated the flow.  Using
              information about Japan's economic rise and decline, eliciting qualitative as
              well as statistical data on labor migration, the student will test the
              hypothesis that the more recently a Brazilian migrant arrived in Japan, the
              more independent of structural factors in both sending and receiving countries
              was in their decision to migrate.  The student will construct a sample of 100
              Brazilian residents of the Nagoya area, stratified by date of arrival in Japan.
               Semi-structured interviews on their migration history will be complemented by
              archival data on both Japan's and Brazil's economic situation over the period
              of the study.  The study will serve as a valuable test of the theory, and will
              lead to a better understanding of some of the limitations and unintended
              consequences of immigration policy in an increasingly transnational world.  In
              addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist, and
              advances our knowledge of this important area of the world.
