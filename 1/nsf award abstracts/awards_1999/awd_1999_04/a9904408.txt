	This project supports the dissertation research
              of an anthropology student from the University of California, San Diego,
              studying the cultural orientations of Southeast Asian Americans.  Using a
              questionnaire to measure cultural motive schemas shared by socio-cultural
              groups, the student in collaboration with her adviser will compare
              questionnaires and semi-structured interview data from Vietnamese Americans. 
              The questionnaire date will be analyzed using principal components analysis and
              the interview data will be analyzed using discourse analysis techniques
              developed by anthropologists for the purpose of discovering cultural schemas. 
              With clearer documentation of Vietnamese American cultural schemas and
              orientations, the researchers will proceed to conduct statistical analyses to
              investigate the association between cultural and social structural variables. 
              Analysis of data from further unstructured interviews will document the sets of
              motive schemas composing individuals' personalities. 
This project develops
              reliable, valid measures of the cultural and psychological variables discussed
              in immigration studies.  Such methods are a necessary component of social
              scientists' ability to compare their findings with those of others and to more
              accurately model the determinants of economic and psychological outcomes.  The
              results from this project can advance our understanding of the fundamental
              causes of the relative economic success of Southeast Asian Americans. In
              addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist.
