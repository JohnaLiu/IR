Abstract    :
              The proposed research is  to develop a global numerical downscaling system for
              seasonal climate prediction at North Carolina State University. The suite of
              models involved in the initiative include: (i) a global non hydrostatic
              semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian variable resolution GCM, (ii) a regional coupled
              atmosphere-lake model and (iii) a coupled coastal ocean model. The proposal
              focuses on eastern Africa.  The primary goal is to provide climate information
              at spatial scales, that is more consistent with the requirements of the
              end-users.  The PIs will collaborate in a pilot study, with counterpart
              scientists in east Africa on the exchange of climate information using
              Internet-based communication.  The work is important because it will contribute
              to the understanding of regional climate model coupling to GCMs for improved
              seasonal climate prediction.
