Abstract    :
              The locations of sensory stimuli are encoded in different frames of reference in
              different sensory systems. The visual system encodes the location of an object
              in retinocentric coordinates, while the auditory system, whose receptors are
              frequency not spatially sensitive, encodes the location of an object in
              head-centered coordinates.  This project is designed to study how information
              from these two modalities is integrated to produce a single, unique, and
              coherent view of the perceptual world, and used to generate purposeful
              orienting responses.  To accomplish this goal a combination of behavioral and
              physiological techniques will be used to study orienting behavior and its
              underlying physiology in a drug-free preparation.  This approach is
              complemented by state of the art anatomical techniques aimed at characterizing
              the connectivity of the neural substrate underlying orienting behavior.
      
               The study of how sensory information from different modalities is integrated
              and transformed into motor commands is one of the most important issues in
              systems neuroscience.  Understanding how the different parts of the nervous
              system contribute to such processes provides important information for the
              diagnosis of neurological problems as well as information that may help in the
              design of robotic aids for individuals with impaired sensory/motor function.
