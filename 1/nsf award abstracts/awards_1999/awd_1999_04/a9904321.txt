This project is a study of liquid crystalline phases which
              trace in a virtually step-wise fashion the development out of the liquid phase
              of the orientational and positional order characteristic of solids.  Striking
              new elements within this theme emerged with the discoveries of ferroelectricity
              and twist grain boundary phases in liquid crystals.  The technique of dynamic
              light scattering will be used to address these important topics in chiral
              liquid crystals exhibiting a variety of recently discovered ferro-, antiferro-,
              and ferrielectric phases, as well as in materials possessing twisted grain
              boundary structure.  As a future direction, the order parameter dynamics of
              recently discovered achiral ferroelectric liquid crystals will be
              investigated.

Well integrated research and education projects on ferro- and
              antiferroelectric liquid crystals have high technological significance in that
              fundamental studies on these materials are widely acknowledged to be providing
              an important basis for the next-generation electro-optical devices.  Students
              trained on these types of fundamental science projects will likely face
              enhanced job opportunities in these and related areas viewed as high-risk but
              high-potential for economic impact.
