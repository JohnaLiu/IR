Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of developmental
              genetics and is entitled "Isolation of sex determination factors from the
              Caribbean Fruit Fly."  The Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa, is an
              important economic pest and also an excellent subject for evolutionary studies.
               Three principal components of the sex determination hierarchy (Sxl, tra, and
              dsx) are being isolated and characterized in this insect based on what we know
              about this process in Drosophila.
