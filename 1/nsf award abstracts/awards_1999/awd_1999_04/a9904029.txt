The plant Heliconia bihai presents an
              extraordinary variation in bract color.  In the Caribbean islands of St. Lucia
              and St. Vincent, some populations present one color form while others may
              present more.  As a first step toward characterizing the factors that regulate
              such variation, Dr. Melendez Ackerman will describe the distribution patterns
              of bract color. Heliconia bracts presumably help advertise nectar quality to
              hummingbirds, thereby ensuring flower pollination and subsequently seed
              production. Some colors could be more abundant than others because they are
              better at attracting pollinators and producing more seeds. On the other hand,
              intermediate bract colors may be the product of natural hybridization.  Dr.
              Melendez Ackerman will begin to test these ideas with detailed pollinator
              observations, records of seed production and genetic data from natural
              populations.

Understanding the factors that lead to or maintain bract color
              variation in H. bihai will allow predictions about the stability of such
              variability in natural populations.  Because of their colorful bracts,
              Heliconia are of high commercial value.  The results of this research will be
              of potential use in the design of management plans that target the preservation
              of variation in this species.
