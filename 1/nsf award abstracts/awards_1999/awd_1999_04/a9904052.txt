This award supports a planning visit by Jay Frankel and a
              graduate student to Hong Kong to organize a workshop on computational advances
              in the developing area of radial basis functions together with Professor
              You-Chung Hon, City University of Hong Kong.  The thrust of the workshop is to
              discuss development of innovative ways to solve the basic problems of
              simulating continuum mechanics as they occur in the analysis of fluid flows and
              chemical reactions.
