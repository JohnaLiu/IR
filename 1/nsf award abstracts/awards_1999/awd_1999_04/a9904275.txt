Abstract    :
              This project explores the synthesis of nanoscale molecules and the study of
              their stereochemistry.  Three nanoscale molecular morphologies will be studied:
               stem-palmate clusters, entwined networks, and shells and surfaces. 
              Experimental, theoretical and computational chemistry will brought to bear on
              the elucidation of nanoscale molecules with these morphologies, and new
              synthetic routes will be developed to synthesize chemical structures chosen to
              expand and mature the area of nanoscale molecular design.

With this Award,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues support for the
              research of Professor Jay Siegel of the University of California - San Diego. 
              Professor Siegel and co-workers are exploring the nature of new kinds of
              organic matter that bridge the gap between the microscopic and macroscopic. 
              These molecular assemblies will be subject to rational and deliberate design
              principles based on fundamental organic chemistry, and their properties will be
              explored using a variety of techniques.  With this knowledge, the ability to
              create very large molecules with specific properties and purposes may soon be
              realized.
