Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of new methods for organic
              synthesis and the application of the resulting methodology to the synthesis of
              complex natural products.  Studies proposed include the development of methods
              for the constructive synthesis of alkenes, the development of new strategies
              for alkylation using silylated tosylhydrazones as electrophiles and the
              development of new methodology for asymmetric Michael addition reactions using
              alpha, beta-unsaturated amides of pseudoephedrine as chiral Michael acceptors. 
              Targets of interest include bicyclopentadienylene, L-696,474 and terpestacin. 
              

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              is supporting the research of Dr. Andrew G. Myers of the Department of
              Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University.  Professor Myers will
              focus his work on the development of synthetic methodology and the preparation
              of natural products having important biological properties.  The research will
              have a broad impact on the pharmaceutical industry and is an excellent vehicle
              for the training of graduate students.
