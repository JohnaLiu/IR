Abstract    :
              The meeting "DNA Repair and Mutagenesis:  Mechanisms, Control and Biological
              Consequences" is an American Society for Microbiology sponsored conference. 
              The meeting will bring together the various sub-disciplines that collectively
              comprise the field of DNA repair and mutagenesis.   Conferences on this subject
              have been held at approximately 4-year intervals since 1974 and have played a
              critical role in the development of this exciting area of research.  Attendance
              is expected to be about 500, and careful thought has been given to the choice
              of site and design of the program so that the participants will be able to take
              part in the informal interactive environment normally found only at smaller
              meetings.  The meeting will be international in scope, but mechanisms have been
              devised to encourage the participation of young investigators, postdoctoral
              fellows and graduate students.  The fundamental science underlying recent
              discoveries that important genes found in humans encode proteins similar to the
              bacterial E. coli helicase family will be covered in depth, with topics ranging
              from crystal structure of DNA repair proteins, the biochemistry of
              multi-protein repair systems, genetic analysis of cellular responses to DNA
              damage, and analysis of DNA damage checkpoint control systems.
