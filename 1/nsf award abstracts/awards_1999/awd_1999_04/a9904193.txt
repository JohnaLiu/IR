Inventure Place will present "Interactive Experiences
              Introducing Polymer Science."  This planning grant will enable Inventure Place
              and its partner,  the College of Polymer Science and Engineering at the
              University of Akron, to conduct audience research and prototyping and resolve
              design issues for the development of an integrated program of permanent and
              traveling interactive exhibits, learning labs, and educational activities
              introducing families and students to polymer science.  Through accessible
              experiences, Inventure Place will introduce some basic concepts in the physical
              sciences, raise "polymer literacy", and introduce related careers.
