Abstract    :
              With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Kevin Smith, of the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Davis, is studying
              the synthesis and chemistry of chlorophylls and related compounds.  Professor
              Smith's studies are focused on the synthesis and structure of nonplanar
              porphyrins, calixarenoporphyrins, sensitizers for photodynamic therapy,
              conformationally-locked phytochrome chromophores, aromatic-fused porphyrin
              systems, and porphyrin-metallocene systems, as well as on the Diels-Alder
              chemistry of porphyrin and phthalocyanine-based systems.

Porphyrins and
              chlorophylls are vital catalysts and agents in life processes, and an increased
              understanding of their chemistry and biology remains an important objective. 
              Chlorophylls are the catalysts in photosynthesis, while porphyrins and their
              metal complexes serve, inter alia, as biomimics of chlorophylls and as
              potential photochemical sensitizers for treatment of tumors.  Professor Kevin
              Smith, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Davis,
              is supported by the Organic Synthesis Program for his studies of the synthesis,
              structure, and reactivity of a wide variety of porphyrin, chlorophyll, and
              related compounds.  Through these studies, Professor Smith is not only
              addressing the specific issues of biomimicry and photosensitization, but also
              is developing the fundamental synthetic tools required for the further
              development of these important natural (or naturally-inspired) products.
