              ABSTRACT
ALESSANDRO GOMEZ
CTS-9904296

This is an experimental and
              computational investigation of the interaction of laminar counterflow gaseous
              and spray diffusion flames with laminar vortices.  Several laser diagnostic
              techniques are applied, including two-component phase Doppler interferometriy
              to measure gas and droplet velocities and the droplet size distribution;
              Stokes/antiStokes Raman scattering to obtain gas-phase temperature; line Raman
              scattering to measure the concentrations of major species and to determine the
              mixture fractions; and planar laser-induced fluorescence of formaldehyde
              (CH2O), hydroxyl (OH), and methyne (CH) to monitor flame response to the
              vortex-induced perturbation.  When feasible, these techniques are phase-locked
              to the arrival of the vortex.  Computationally, the gas phase is modeled using
              an Eulerian formulation and the droplet phase is modeled using a Lagrangian
              formulation; the model includes detailed transport and chemical kinetics and
              size distribution effects.  The emphasis is on methanol and heptane flames with
              the fuel supplied either as a spray or in vapor form.  The approach is intended
              to provide an understanding of the flame-vortex interaction, including the
              effects of time dependence and curvature on flame structure , extinction and
              re-ignition behavior, and pollutant formation.
