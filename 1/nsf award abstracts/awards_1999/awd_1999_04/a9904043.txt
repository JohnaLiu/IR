This project proposes to develop new techniques in direct
              imaging of P to S converted phases on broadband seismic arrays.  The PI
              proposes to work on four main analytical fronts for developing a working
              procedure that can be applied to large, broadband datasets such as those
              collected by IRIS stations and temporary PASSCAL deployments:  1) wavefield
              separation and deconvolution; 2) understanding optimal ways to design the
              weighted stacking algorithm; 3) statics; and 4) multisource stacking and
              wavefield imaging.  The new technique will be developed into a workable
              procedure and used to process two broadband arrays at different scales:  data
              from the Lodore array in northwestern Colorado will be processed to define the
              difference in lower crust and upper mantle structure associated with a
              Precambrian suture between the Colorado Plateau and the Wyoming craton.  Data
              from an array being deployed in the Tien Shan will be used to define topography
              on major upper mantle discontinuities and lateral variations in crustal
              structure at an intracontinental collisional zone.
