Abstract    :
              This award is for the partial travel support for students and young scientists
              to attend the annual conference in Computational Neuroscience.The award is
              solely for travel support for especially needy participants. The CNS
              conference, now approaching its 10th year, brings together a group of
              internationally recognized computational neuroscientists.  Along with the
              invited talks, the general sessions provide a comprehensive treatment of topics
              in the field.  This meeting provides an environment that fosters communication
              among theoreticians, modelers, and experimental neurobiologists.  The meeting
              and its proceedings are published in the Journal of Computational Neurobiology
              to ensure that accepted works can have a broad impact.
