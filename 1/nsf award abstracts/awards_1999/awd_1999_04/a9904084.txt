Abstract    :
              This project proposes to derive an assessment of the potential climate change
              impacts on a major metropolitan region (New York City and environs).  The study
              will comprise one regional component of the ongoing U.S. National Assessment on
              the potential consequences of climate variability and change.  The proposal
              includes a number of focused activities including human health, coastal
              inundation, water facilities, infrastructure, and community interaction and
              outreach.  Each element will assess the potential impacts through analysis of
              current conditions and scenario predictions.  The result will identify areas
              for decision and additional research.  A number of databases will be developed
              to provide information for future decisions affecting the metropolitan
              area.
