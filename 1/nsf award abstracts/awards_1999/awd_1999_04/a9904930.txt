This project will examine the relationship between
              claims of indigenous identity in Alaska and the implementation of laws that
              rely on notions of cultural difference. Specifically, it considers how the
              tribal court of Koyukuk, an Alaska Native village, negotiates competing sets of
              rights - children's rights and native rights - in its attempt to maintain
              autonomy in Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) cases.  ICWA, a 1978 federal
              statute, transferred jurisdiction of native child welfare cases to tribal
              courts, although the state of Alaska resists this transfer.  

Combining
              concerns of indigenous identity, child welfare, and legal practice, this study
              will contribute to understandings of how changing concepts of cultural
              difference, embodied in law, impact the ways in which indigenous communities
              make claims about themselves. Spanning twelve months, the project will include
              archival research, court observations, and interviews collected in Koyukuk and
              Fairbanks.  Research will critically analyze tribal court practices within the
              context of state and federal actions.  This project seeks to understand how
              underlying notions of national and ethnic cultures shape court decisions and
              how the implementation of ICWA in Alaska creates a forum in which to argue
              about cultural difference and equality.
