Title:	Coordination of PEP I Research Activities

This proposal
              seeks funds for coordination of research activities along the Pole-Equator-Pole
              I (PEP I) transect of the Past Global Changes (PAGES) project. Prior grants to
              V. Markgraf; INSTAAR, established the first PEP I office in 1993. Project
              leadership has now been transferred to G. Seltzer, Syracuse University, and the
              requested funds will be used to continue the activities of the PEP I office
              over the next five years.
In March 1998 a meeting of PEP I was held in Merida,
              Venezuela, which ended the first five years of coordinated activity along this
              transect. The meeting preceded the open science meeting of PAGES, which was
              held in London, England, in May 1998. As an outcome of these two meetings, many
              areas of scientific focus warrant continued coordination and analysis during
              the next phase of PEP I activity. Based on these areas of emphasis, themes will
              be chosen for a series of annual workshops. The intent of the workshops will be
              to address the following questions: (1) what is the nature of the extant
              paleodata in the Americas and where are the critical gaps in these data,
              especially in the tropics and South America? (2) what is the current
              understanding of climatic teleconnections between the northern and southern
              hemispheres with regard to these overriding themes? and (3) other than a
              compendium of current projects and data, how can a synthesis of observations
              and interpretations be developed for these themes? These workshops will
              culminate in the next PEPI science meeting at which these syntheses on the
              proposed themes as well as other questions will be presented and
              published.
The role of the PEP I office in carrying out these objectives will
              be to help organizers obtain funding for these workshops by providing
              preliminary focus, ideas, and contacts. The project leader of PEPI will
              continue to act as the representative of the PEP I transect to meetings of
              PAGES and other related projects. Contact with the scientific community will be
              maintained through the PAGES and IGBP newsletters and through the World Wide
              Web. Finally, the PEP I office will organize the next science meeting of the
              transect.
