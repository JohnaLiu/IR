Abstract    :
              
Organisms protect themselves from numerous environmental stresses using the
              heat shock response, which includes an increase in the abundance of heat shock
              proteins (HSPs).  Some of these HSPs serve as molecular chaparones to allow
              proteins to retain the 3-dimensional structure necessary for protein function. 
              Much work has been done on the cell and molecular biology of HSPs.  This
              symposium will assess the role of HSPs in nature and the evolution of HSPs and
              the heat shock response.  Some speakers will address the role of HSPs in
              organismal tolerance to heat, hibernation, response to parasitism and in normal
              development and aging processes.  Other participants will emphasize the
              expression of HSPs in organisms in nature, the cost and benefits of HSP
              expression and the evolution of HSP genes.  The symposium will facilitate
              discussion, interaction and collaboration among scientists in diverse
              disciplines who are studying this important biological issue.  The symposium
              will review the current state of knowledge about HSPs in organismal biology and
              highlight unanswered questions.  By doing so, it will determine future research
              directions.
