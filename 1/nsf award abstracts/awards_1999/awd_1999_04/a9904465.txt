Abstract    :
              This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification program
              sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations program of the
              Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Dr.
              Duane Bruley at UMBC.  The proposal describes a program to study a method
              called Immobilized Metal Affininty Chromatography (IMAC ) for extracting high
              molecular weight proteins from natural blood.  It has the potential for
              yielding a less expensive route for doing this than methods based upon the use
              of monoclonal antibodies as well as those exploiting rDNA technology.  The
              proteins to be extracted could be important in the treatment of many diseases
              including hemphilia A and deep vein thrombosis(DVT).   
Current therapies for
              these conditions involve drugs with serious side-effects.  The PI has outlined
              a program for studying his technique for isolating protein C from both blood
              plasma supplied by the American Red Cross and transgenic swine milk supplied by
              Virginia Polytechnic Institute.
