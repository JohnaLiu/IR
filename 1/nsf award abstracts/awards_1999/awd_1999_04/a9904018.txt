The objective of this research is to further develop a
              unique multifrequency capacity to perform and analyze advanced paramagnetic
              resonance (amr) spectroscopies (electron-nuclear double resonance, endor;
              electron spin-echo envelope modulation, eseem) as a powerful, selective, and
              sensitive ally to X-ray crystallography for characterizing metalloenzyme active
              sites and their interactions with substrates/inhibitors/products, both in the
              resting state and in key intermediates. The amr studies of metalloenzymes will
              emphasize three areas: (I) The amr of integer-spin, systems with high spin (S >
              1), but which exhibit an epr-active, ground-state Non-Kramers doublet; (II)
              Substrate and inhibitor interactions with the molybdenum-iron cofactor of the
              nitrogenase MoFe protein; and (III) The mechanism of methane production by
              Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) isolated from Methanobacterium
              thermoautotrophicum.

	
Metal ions are pervasive in biology; no less than
              one-third of all proteins and enzymes require metal ions as cofactors. This
              program seeks to develop and apply advanced paramagnetic resonance (amr)
              spectroscopies as a powerful, selective, and sensitive ally to X-ray
              crystallography for characterizing metalloenzyme active sites and their
              interactions with substrates, both in the resting state and in key
              intermediates. In addition to the development of new methodologies, this
              program is engaged in the study of the environmentally and agriculturally
              important enzyme, nitrogenase, and in the study of the production of the
              greenhouse gas, methane, by a bacterial enzyme, Methyl-coenzyme M reductase,
              isolated from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum.
