Title: Water Vapor
              Variations Associated with the Life Cycle of the MJO: Analysis of NCAR CCM and
              TOVS Pathfinder

The proposed exploratory research will analyze  TOVS
              Pathfinder data to provide an observational description of the water vapor
              variability associated with the life cycle of the Madden-Julian Oscillation
              (MJO), the most important mode of tropical intraseasonal variability. This
              observational description will be compared to those depicted by NCAR CCM2 and
              CCM3 simulations, that exhibit relatively good and poor MJO simulations,
              respectively. The work is important because it will advance understanding of
              the MJO and provide a more robust observational foundation to guide further
              model development and improvement.
