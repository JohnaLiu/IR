	This award provides partial funding support to acquire
              and install instrumentation for the study of plate boundary deformation, with
              special emphasis on its relation to earthquakes, its most conspicuous and
              hazardous manifestation. The deployment of instruments to measure deformation
              will include borehole strainmeters, Global Positioning System (GPS) dual
              frequency receivers, as well as improved data gathering capabilities for
              measuring strain with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (INSAR)
              techniques. The strain measurements will focus on the San Francisco Bay area
              and extend southward along the Central San Andreas Fault system (the "boundary"
              between the North American plate and the Pacific plate). Because the time scale
              for deformation along the plate boundary ranges over eight orders of magnitude,
              from seconds to decades, the integrated instrumental approach taken here is the
              only one capable of providing a broadband coverage from strain transients to
              slow creep. The team in charge of the project includes scientists from the
              University of California at Berkeley and San Diego, the Carnegie Institution of
              Washington, and the U.S. Geological Survey. The data gathered by the instrument
              system will be made freely available to the scientific community and will be
              valuable to earth scientists and engineers studying earthquakes as well as for
              basic investigating fundamental Earth processes.
