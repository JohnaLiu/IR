Abstract    :
              A. Project Summary
The Institute for Computational Sciences and Informatics
              (CSI) at George Mason University will acquire a Beowulf-class parallel
              computing cluster with 64 dual-processor nodes running the Linux operating
              system. Each processor is a 450Mhz Pentium II. The cluster will run the Message
              Passing Interface (MPI) and the Parallel Virtual Machine systems (PVM) with C,
              C++, and Fortran bindings. Other parallel computing tools include both High
              Performance Fortran (HPF) and Fortran 90 (F90). 

The equipment will be used
              to support several research projects with high computational demands including
              hydrodynamic modeling of interacting galaxies, gene network analysis,
              computational hemodynamics, analysis of fractality, self similarity, and
              complexity in aerogels, and new uses of immersive environments in statistical
              data analysis.
