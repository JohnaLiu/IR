Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to develop a porous media test facility to study the fate
              and transport of subsurface chemicals. The new facility allows multidimensional
              experiments and the detection and measurement of chemicals by physical,
              chemical, and biological methods. The facility would also be used to test new
              remediation schemes and for the training of undergraduate and graduate
              students. Researchers from a number of departments and from local universities
              will have access to the equipment.
