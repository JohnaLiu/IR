Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Special Projects Office of the Chemistry
              Division supports the research of Professor Virginia Cornish at Columbia
              University.  The theme of the research is the development of
              dexamethasone-tetracycline as an H1-H2 pair of chemical handles capable of
              inducing protein dimerization in vivo with high efficiency.  

The need for
              efficient catalysts is fundamental to chemistry.  Biological catalysts drive
              cellular processes, and the chemical industry relies on catalysts for the
              synthesis of compounds ranging from pharmaceuticals to materials.  In this
              project proteins, which are remarkable catalysts for a broad array of
              reactions, will be designed using combinatorial techniques, which allow large
              pools of protein variants to be generated and screened simultaneously.  A
              selection strategy that is both a direct screen for catalysis and can be
              applied to many different reaction types, will be developed.
