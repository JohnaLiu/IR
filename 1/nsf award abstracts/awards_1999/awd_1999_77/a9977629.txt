This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              California at Santa Cruz provides funds to acquire a flame absorption atomic
              spectrometer and an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer to
              be operated by the Marine Analytical Laboratory at UCSC in conjunction with an
              existing high resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer.  The new
              instrumentation will be used by researchers in several disciplines, and will
              include training for graduate and undergraduate students through an existing
              analytical methods course.  The project is supported by the Division of Ocean
              Sciences at NSF.  University of California will provide cost-share support for
              more than 30% of total project costs.
