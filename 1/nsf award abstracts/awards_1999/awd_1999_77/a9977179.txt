Real-Time Distributed Control: Optimizing Mechanical Performance
              using Adaptive Computing and Communication Techniques
This research addresses
              the trend in application areas that range from robotic machining to autonomous
              vehicle control of moving away from monolithic, centralized control algorithms
              towards decentralized, distributed real-time control implementations.  The
              overall performance of such control systems depends not only on the control
              algorithms which are used, but also on the computing hardware and software
              modules which realize them.  The goal of this project is to develop a framework
              in which distributed control systems can be designed, analyzed, and optimized. 
              Different control architectures (allocation of processing tasks to hardware
              modules) will be considered, and the delays inherent in each architecture will
              be characterized based on the underlying computing infrastructure (networks,
              processors, etc).  The effect of each type of delay on the mechanical
              performance of the system will be analyzed.  This information will be used to
              improve the mechanical performance using adaptive computing and communication,
              that is, assigning priority to the computational or communication tasks which
              have the largest impact on the mechanical performance of the control system. 
              This integration of mechanical engineering and computer science in the
              industrially-relevant application area of real-time distributed control
              promises to result in fundamental and pragmatic results in both areas, and
              should find immediate applicability to real-world problems.
