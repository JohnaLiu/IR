Abstract    :
                   The proposal describes theoretical research on two topics.  Research on
              reciprocity will develop an axiomatic foundation for preferences 	that may
              exhibit both altruism and spite. It is proposed to use this representation to
              provide a systematic explanation of a large body of experimental results; to
              develop the theory to develop definitions of nice and nasty behavior in games;
              and to provide evolutionary foundations for preferences for reciprocity.
    
              Research on standards will extend work on the dynamics of barriers created to
              gain entry into elite groups. One study will generalize previous results on
              declining standards to environments in which candidates may supply more than
              the minimum necessary to enter the group. Another study will develop a model
              that explains how the composition of a group changes over time. This study may
              provide an understanding of what rules lead to group quality to be stable over
              time. It also will provide a theory of segregation based on differential
              abilities to observe quality. A third study will discuss how the ability to
              create new standards leads to a degradation of existing standards.
