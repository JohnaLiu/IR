Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) and Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs, the Department of
              Chemistry at Montana Tech University will acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer.
              This equipment will enhance research on studies of the structural
              characterization of secondary metabolites from microbes isolated from unique
              ecological niches; study of organic carbon in the sediments and the
              identification of changes in the organic matter from the overlying water and
              with burial depth; the development of electrically conducting polymers for
              removal of metal ions from aqueous systems; and studies on the structural
              mechanism of sorption of organic and organo-phosphorus compounds on
              metal-colloids.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in materials and environmental
              chemistry.
