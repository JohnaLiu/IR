Abstract    :
              
The IEEE's Society for the Social Implications of Technology (SSIT), the IEEE
              History Center, and the IEEE Women in Engineering Committee (WIE) will
              cosponsor the 1999 International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS 99)
              to be held 29-31 July 1999 at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.  The theme
              of this symposium is "Women and Technology:  Historical, Societal, and
              Professional Perspectives."  The target audience for this symposium includes
              scholars and students in a range of fields, and practicing engineers.  This
              grant provides $8,000 to help offset travel expenses and conference fees for
              individuals making presentations at the conference.
