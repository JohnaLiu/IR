Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) and
              Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs will assist the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of California in Riverside acquire a Mass
              Spectrometer.  This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including 1) entomology and neurosciences pertaining to the biochemistry of
              peptide and protein signaling molecules, specifically the identification and
              characterization of venom toxins; 2) hormones involved in regulation of insect
              ecdysis; 3) biochemical studies of the mechanism by which the proteasome enzyme
              complex sequesters and cleaves denatured proteins; 3) the chemistry of
              bifunctional catalysis: enhancing nucleophilic catalysts by intramolecular
              lewis acid activation; 4) characterization of well-defined and high-dimensional
              monomers, oligomers & polymers; 5) the chemistry of amino acid sidechain
              exchange in proteins; 6) synthesis, structural and biological studies of
              biomedically significant natural products; 7) interaction of heparin with
              peptides; 8) sulfur chemistry: fullerenes & oligomeric fullerenes; 9)
              identification of gene products involved in plant responses to low oxygen
              stress; 10) environmental toxicology: identification of peptides associated
              with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4;  11) characterization of alternative DNA and
              RNA structures; 12) identification of proteins phosphorylated in vivo by the
              p21-activated protein kinase g-PAK.  

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique
              used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular
              compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic
              molecules.
