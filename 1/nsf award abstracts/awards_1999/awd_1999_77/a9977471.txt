MRI: 
              Acquisition of a Superworkstation Cluster for Research and Teaching in
              Distributed Agent-based Computing

This proposal requests funding for a major
              improvement in the research and teaching instrumentation for an extended
              research team in the Department of Computer Science  of George Mason
              University.  The requested equipment involves  a cluster of super-workstations
              which will  expand the current research and teaching infrastructure by an order
              of magnitude.  The equipment will  be dedicated to the research and teaching
              needs at the cutting edge of Distributed Computing and Agent Software.
