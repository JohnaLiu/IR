This Major Research Instrumentation award to Florida International
              University provides an electron probe microanalyzer which will be operated as a
              regional facility on behalf of five Florida universities.  It will be
              particularly used for research in ocean and earth sciences, as well as
              materials science research. It will include remote access over Internet via T1
              line, which is being installed separately at FIU, which will allow users
              anywhere in the world to carry out sample analyses. The facility will also be
              available to outside researchers on a cost-recovery basis, although priority
              will be given to academic users.  The project is supported by the Division of
              Ocean Sciences at NSF.  Florida International University will provide
              cost-share support for more than 30% of total project costs.
