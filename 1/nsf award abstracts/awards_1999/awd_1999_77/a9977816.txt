This award provides funding to support collaborative research
              between investigators at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,
              Little Rock and the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.  This is highly
              venturesome research with the goal of incorporating into plants the genetic
              capability to produce antibodies to phencyclidine, a substance better known in
              drug abuse circles as PCP.  Efforts will first be made with Arabidopsis
              thaliana, a plant commonly used in laboratory experimentation.  If the capacity
              to produce and store large amounts of antibody can be introduced into this
              first plant, then the long-range goal of transferring this technology to an
              agronomic crop like soybeans will be attempted.  This project has the potential
              to result in both a cheap way of producing large amounts of antibody for use in
              drug abuse treatment and a possible new highly lucrative crop to revitalize
              agriculture in Arkansas.
