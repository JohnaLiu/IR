Abstract    :
              

The proposal describes a program to exploit semiconductors for quantum
              optics information devices.  Recent work in quantum optics using free-atoms has
              led to remarkable advances. The main idea of this proposal is to realize the
              strong coupling effects in semiconductors in a similar manner as that
              demonstrated in free-atoms.  In particular, the PIs propose to investigate the
              implementation of 3D optical microcavities containing excitonic quantum dots to
              achieve quantum optics strong-coupling on the single photon-exciton level. 
              Based on it, the conditional quantum phase gate, the basic building block for
              quantum computation, can be built.
