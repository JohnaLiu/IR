Abstract    :
              This major research infrastructure (MRI) award to the University of Delaware
              will develop a parallel processor computer facility consisting of multiple
              nodes with fast ethernet connections and large amounts of local disk and
              memory. The hardware configuration will be a so-called Beowulf class computer
              running the linux operating system. The computing facility will support the
              development of scalable algorithms and codes specific to physics disciplines at
              Bartol Research Institute and the University, including space physics, cosmic
              ray physics, fluid and plasma turbulence, heliospheric structure, Lattice
              Boltzmann techniques, molecular physics, and hot star winds.  By supporting
              development of key codes in each discipline, this project will enable the
              respective groups to maintain their leadership positions into the next
              generation of computational and computing hardware. The development effort will
              involve junior personnel and students who will interact with both physicists
              and computer scientists on various aspects of the project.
