This is an equipment grant supported under the MRI
              Program. The instruments to be acquired are Nano Indenter XP and its related
              accessories which are able to deform very small volumes of material to
              characterize a material's mechanical properties. This instrument can measure
              the properties of extremely thin films and coatings, individual phases within a
              multi phase or composite material as well as other materials not well suited
              for conventional testing. In the dynamic nanoindentation option which uses the
              Continuous Stiffness Measurement (CMS) technique in conjunction with the
              Dynamic Contact Module (DCM), the system can provide a direct and accurate
              measurement of the contact stiffness at all depths. Material properties may
              thus be determined continuously. The Lateral Force Measurement (LFM) option
              provides an effective tool in characterizing scratch resistance in bulk
              materials and coatings, and adhesion and ode of failure in thin films. The
              instrument will be utilized in research related to micro-structural
              characterization of materials. These research activities address issues dealing
              with light weight composites with fine fibers and/or small particles, thin
              films, multi-phase polymeric systems, surface mechanical properties of silicon
              wafers and direct-write mesoscopic structures. In all these activities the
              nanoindentation system is expected to yield significant insight into the
              behavior of these materials.***
