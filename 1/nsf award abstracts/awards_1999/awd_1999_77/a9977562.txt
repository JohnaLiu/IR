Motion Planing and Control for Tapping

This
              is the first year funding of a three year continuing award. The purpose of this
              project is to advance our understanding of tapping as a mode of manipulation.
              Tapping, in its most basic form, consists of striking an object, imparting some
              initial velocities, and then
letting it slide until it comes to rest due to
              friction.  The goal of this project is to develop general motion planning
              algorithms and stable feedback control techniques for positioning tasks using
              tapping.  The main focus of this research is understanding the role of part
              shape and actuator constraints in these problems.  Part shape affects both the
              mechanics of sliding and how the object can be struck to generate initial
              velocities.  Actuator constraints, such as using fixed-position tapping
              actuators, limit the taps that can be applied to the object.  Motion planning
              and feedback control must account for both types of constraints in order to
              create and execute robust tapping plans.  This work will be evaluated
              experimentally by building a "tapping micropositioning cell" which will
              precisely position a part by repeatedly sensing its configuration and firing
              one of the
fixed-position tapping actuators about the perimeter of the cell.
