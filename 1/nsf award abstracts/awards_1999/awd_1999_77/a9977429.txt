This Major Research Instrumentation award to Lamont-Doherty
              Earth Observatory of Columbia University in the City of New York provides an
              Excimer ultraviolet laser system, an upgrade option for improved resolution, a
              desolvating nebulizer for small sample introduction, and an ion chromatograph,
              all to be used with an existing inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer
              for oceanographic and environmental sciences research.  It will be used for a
              wide variety of research projects, and will be integrated into a facility which
              is heavily used for research and graduate training by LDEO scientists, as well
              as other departments of Columbia University and outside researchers.  The
              project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.  Columbia
              University will provide cost-share support for >32% of total project
              costs.
