This award provides support, primarily for equipment and
              software, to create a distributed Visualization Laboratory for the University
              of Puerto Rico system.  This facility will make available specialized equipment
              and technical support resources to allow faculty imaging capabilities in
              analysis of research data and the potential to develop visually-based course
              materials for undergraduate and graduate education.  The networked nature of
              this distributed facility will allow sharing of resources and the rapid
              exchange of image rich information.  Initially users will include researchers
              and educators from the Medical School in San Juan and the Rio Piedras and
              Mayaguez campuses of the University of Puerto Rico, with subsequent attention
              to the needs of researchers associated with the NAIC Arecibo Observatory and
              the International Institute of Tropical Forestry.  A Visualization Resource
              Development Center, a Scientific Visualization Center and an Image Processing
              Center will be located at the Mayaguez campus and a Scientific Visualization
              Center will be placed at the Rio Piedras campus.  This infrastructure will
              allow researchers in Puerto Rico from many different subject areas to take full
              advantage of the rich opportunities provided by high performance computing and
              Internet II connectivity.  Important collaborations with mainland researchers
              may also become feasible.
