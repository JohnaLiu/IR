This
              Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a state
              of the art hot wire anemometry and data acquisition system to support the
              Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research in Turbulence project at Valparaiso
              University. The project will investigate atmospheric and engineering scale
              turbulent transport.  The project's main focus is on the education and training
              of students in both Colleges of Engineering and of Arts and Sciences in the
              specific areas of atmospheric turbulence, environmental pollution in turbulent
              air and water flows, and generalized modeling of the turbulent transport of
              mass and thermal energy. In addition, it will be used in developing an
              educational seminar for faculty from nearby institutions.
