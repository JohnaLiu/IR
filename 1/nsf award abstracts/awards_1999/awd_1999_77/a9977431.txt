Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley will purchase a Sun Enterprise 5500
              file server to replace a Sun Enterprise 2000 in serving the 41 Workstations
              being used by all the faculty and graduate students of the Department. Many
              faculty and student research projects are heavily computational. The projects
              include various questions in genomics and statistical genetics (Speed),
              predictionmethods for large and complex data sets (Breiman), problems in
              highway transportation also viewed as a test bed for modelling across temporal
              and spatial scales (Bickel and Rice), networks with temporal processes at the
              nodes with neuroscience applications (Brillinger), and image compression and
              denoising and forestry species recognition (Yu).
