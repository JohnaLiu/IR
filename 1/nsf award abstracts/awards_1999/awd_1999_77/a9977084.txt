This US-Canada workshop on theoretical methods for
              strongly correlated Fermions, organized by Dr. Andrei E. Ruckenstein of the
              Department of Physics and Astronomy of Rutgers University, and Dr. Andre-Marie
              Tremblay of the University of Sherbrooke, Canada, aims to give a critical
              overview and to assess the internal consistency and reliability of various
              techniques commonly used in the study of strongly correlated systems. 

As
              such the workshop will foster communications and future collaborative research
              projects on topics of mutual interest among junior as well as senior North
              American scientists. The workshop will consist of tutorial lectures,
              presentations, and poster sessions.
