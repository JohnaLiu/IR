MRI: 
              Acquisition of an Experimental Testbed for Computer Graphics

The proposal
              requests a large-scale, multi-processor compute engine with which they plan to
              investigate alternative rendering strategies with potential suitability for
              desktop systems in a decade or so.  Because of the many trade-offs between
              image quality, rendering speed, and interactivity that must be considered, this
              work  is highly experimental in nature and requires dedicated computing power
              sufficient for software implementation of possible approaches able to run
              interactively. The value of improved interactive rendering will be demonstrated
              in a broad range of application areas, including architectural walkthroughs,
              terrain rendering, computer-aided geometric design, medical imaging, and
              scientific visualization.
