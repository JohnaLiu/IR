MRI:  Design
              and Development of a Testbed for a New Generation of Robots for Human
              Environments

The goal of this project is to develop a testbed for safe,
              compliant, and compact robotic arms suitable for the emerging generation of
              robots destined to operate in human environments.  The PI's propose to design
              and develop a manipulation system that will be conceived from the start to
              satisfy the requirements and needs for operating in human environments.  This
              human-centered manipulation system will be a two-arm structure connected to a
              common torso mounted on a mobile platform. Each arm will be a redundant
              mechanism with seven degrees of freedom. The arms will be lightweight
              structures, with low effective mass and inertia, and will use energy absorbing
              surfaces.  The actuation of joints will be based on a novel and compact
              arrangement that uses  three motors for two degrees of freedom joint
              mechanization.  This yields a modular pitch-roll kinematics for the shoulder,
              elbow, and wrist joints. The requirements for the integration of two arms with
              the self-contained platform is also an important aspect in this design.
              Reliability, low cost, clean and quite operations will also be among the
              characteristics addressed in this project.
