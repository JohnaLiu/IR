              Equipment Acquisition in Support of Research into the Design of Next-Generation
              High-Speed System-on-a-Chip Designs

The overall goal of this research is to
              demonstrate that the system-on-a-chip design offers a number of advantages and
              to make use of them to develop new applications that have not been possible to
              date.  This proposal requests essential instrumentation to carry out the
              cutting-edge research.  It is proposed to acquire Sun Microsystems servers
              (which will be used to run large design software packages, like Cadence and
              Avant),  a digital tester from Tektronix (which will perform high speed testing
              and verification of advanced DSP chips and high-speed ADC/DAC designs
              implementation) and  a network analyzer from Hewlett-Packard (to be used to
              test RF analog chips and measure S-parameters).  The equipment will be used to
              carry out the following research projects: (i) design of high-performance,
              low-power multimedia DSP and communications systems, (ii) design of software
              radio for wireless portable multimedia chip, (iii) design of ESD protection
              circuits of RF analog inputs and (iv) design of a multimedia
              system-on-a-chip.
