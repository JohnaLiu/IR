Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) and Major Research Instrumentation  Programs, the Department of
              Chemistry at Northern Arizona University will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in the following areas:  the
              synthesis of modified amino acids; binding of metals to DNA; metal binding and
              transport in mammalian systems and plants; and mechanism of self-assembly. 
              

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
              to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such as biochemistry and biotechnology.
