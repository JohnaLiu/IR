Studies show that the electrical permittivity
              of blood changes as a function of temperature at microwave frequencies and that
              the chemical makeup of blood is sensitive to minor changes in pressure. It also
              has been shown that microwave images of biological tissue with blood flow and
              with no blood flow are different. The Principal Investigator has conjectured
              that blood's gamma dispersion would increase for increased pressure, while the
              relaxation frequency would decrease. Confirmation of that conjecture would
              provide knowledge needed for the development of a new medical imaging
              technology. Such a technology would provide for a non-invasive 2-D and perhaps
              3-D viewing of cardiovascular pressure.
