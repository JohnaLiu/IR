Abstract    :
              NSF #9977180

PI:  A.S. Grader

Institution:  Penn State U.

Drs. Grader
              and Halleck request funds for the purchase of a computer-aided X
              ray
Tomography apparatus.  Members of the team have experience in this
              technique since the institution currently operates an older version of the
              proposed purchase.  This proposal is 
well-written.  The team explains clearly
              the limitation of their current facilities, how sample chambers will be
              constructed to accommodate a number of dissimilar applications, and the
              different parts of the equipment.  There is a rather large number of projects
              described within the space limitations imposed by NSF program guidelines. 
              Still, this reviewer felt that a good job was done in terms of describing, in
              nearly every sub-project section, the potential of the X-ray CT instrument for
              each application.  In summary, some level of funding is recommended.
