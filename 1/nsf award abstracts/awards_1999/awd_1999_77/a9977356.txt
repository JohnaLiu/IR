Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) and Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs, the Department of
              Chemistry at San Jose State University will acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer.
              This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas, including the
              development and characterization of materials used for separation purposes;
              development of new drugs from marine natural products; organometallic
              complexes; and catalysis in enzyme processes.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
              frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
              such as materials chemistry, catalysis, and biology.
