This
              Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of core
              instrumentation in the field of rheology at the University of Delaware. It is
              intended to augment the current capabilities and to replace current equipment
              with state of the art technology.  The field of rheology is rapidly evolving,
              with a deeper focus on combined methods for probing material microstructures in
              complex fluids, as well as new challenges in such areas as biotechnology and
              advanced materials. The instrumentation will enable the University to add the
              new techniques of orthogonal superposition, high pressure rheometry,
              differential thermal rheometry, advanced rheo-optics, dielectric thermal
              analysis, and improved electrorheology. 

The instrumentation will be central
              to the University's multidisciplinary rheological community, which spans five
              departments and includes over 14 faculty, 39 Ph.D. students. 15 postdoctoral
              students, and 20 undergraduate research assistants. It will support research in
              the areas of polymers for electrorheological applications, coatings, complex
              fluids, photonic crystals, bio-engineered food additives, food processing, and
              high pressure surfactant solutions.
