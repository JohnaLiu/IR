Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) and Major Research Instrumentation Programs, the Department of Chemistry
              at the University of Kansas  will acquire an upgrade of a 500 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research on structural studies of
              hemoprotein models; the development of synthetic systems to study nucleation of
              peptide helices and sheets; the development and characterization of DNA
              polymerase photoaffinity probes; synthesis of asymmetric P- and S-containing
              organic compounds; the study of hydrophobically-driven peptide aggregation;
              characterization of metal complexation and aggregate formation by humic and
              fulvic acids; and the development of chemical strategies for improving
              bioavailability of peptidomimetics through structural studies.  

Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
              who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
              useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
