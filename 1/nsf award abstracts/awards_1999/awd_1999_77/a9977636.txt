Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) and
              the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs will assist the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee acquire an Inductively
              Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer for Biogeochemistry. This equipment will
              enhance research in many areas, including elemental species analysis in the
              environment; effects of contaminants in the aquatic environment on
              neurobehavioral integration among fish; cellular and molecular mechanisms of
              transition metal metabolism; aquatic bacterial metal metabolism; metalloprotein
              structure and function; and development of synthetic metal ion sensors.

Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
              to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
              and organometallic molecules.
