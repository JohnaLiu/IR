This laboratory study will examine the effect of the order
              of 
magnitude difference between the molecular diffusivities of heat 
and
              salt on the transport of the latter quantities by turbulence.   
The focus
              will be on turbulence in stratified flows that are not 
unstable to
              double-diffusive instabilities.   Motivation for this 
study comes from field
              observations and numerical modeling results 
which suggest that in some types
              of turbulent flow there is 
differential transport of heat and salt.  The
              laboratory experiments 
will provide a more controlled environment and more
              comprehensive 
observations than can be achieved in the field.  The importance
              of 
understanding the degree to which differential transport of heat and
              
salt occurs lies in the role that these transports play in 
determining the
              density stratification of the ocean and consequently 
the large-scale
              climatological transport of heat by the ocean.
