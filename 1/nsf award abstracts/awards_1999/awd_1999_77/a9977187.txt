Funds will be used to purchase new automated DNA
              sequencing equipment with improved capabilities and higher throughput for the
              UNH core facility.  This facility  processes more than 17,000 samples per year
              which are submitted by the labs of some 22 faculty from 5 academic departments
              in the University.  Major projects using the equipment include genome mapping
              of fishes, population genetics of fishes and zooplankton, and cDNA sequencing
              of vertebrate hormones.  Additional studies are focussed on mechanisms of 
              signal transduction in eucaryotic cells, invertebrate models of human leukemia,
              development of transgenic macroalgae, identification of coral symbionts, 
              studies of marine invertebrate phylogeny, and sequencing of vertebrate visual
              pigment genes. Studies of gene structure, function, and evolution continue to
              drive demand for DNA sequencing in our research.  New genomic approaches are
              becoming increasingly prevalent in all areas of biology, and have greatly
              increased the need for genotyping services at our facility in recent years. 
              The new sequencing equipment will enhance the capability, increase the
              capacity, reduce the cost, and improve the reliability of sequencing services
              in the core facility at the University of New Hampshire.
