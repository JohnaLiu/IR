This project supports the acquisition of the high temperature
              axial and torsional mechanical strength testing for research involving the
              disciplines of mechanical engineering, physics, material science, and
              electrical engineering. The equipment will be used to determine the reliability
              of composites and compacted materials, identify failure modes, and testing
              orthopedic implants and characterization of structured composite materials will
              be studied using the axial and torsional mechanical strength testing system.
              The axial horsional lost unit to be acquired will include a
              temperature-controlled sample chamber (-2000F to 10000F), designed such that
              the grips on the component under test as well as the component will be at
              temperature. This capability will be used to develop accelerated aging tests,
              increasing the throughput of components on this system. The capability for
              axial and torsional stress will enable accurate testing of components, such as
              high-tension composite insulators, orthopedic implants and various designs
              using compacted materials where failures under torsional loads are also of
              importance. The instrument will also be used to support research in the
              following areas: the analysis of composites, compacted materials, and
              biomechanical implants under various thermal, mechanical, and environmental
              conditions, and the evaluation of noninvasive monitoring techniques, such as
              the use diffracting particles as strain sensor in composites for in-situ
              measurements of the integrity of components under thermal, mechanical, and/or
              environmental stresses. The experimental data collected will be used as
              analytical models that have been developed are refined to enable accurate
              simulation of the new composite and compacted materials designs. This is an
              equipment grant supported under the MRI Program.***
