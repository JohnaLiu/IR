Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to purchase a MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser
              desorption-time of flight) mass spectrometer, that will be operated as a
              multi-user facility for research at UW-Madison in the area of plant proteomics.
               Specifically, this instrument will be used by a dozen well established
              federally funded laboratories on campus performing genomic research in the
              model higher plant, Arabidopsis thaliana.  The mass spectrometer will be
              operated as part of the UW Biotechnology Center's existing peptide mass
              spectrometry facility.  This instrument will have a dramatic impact on campus
              basic research in plant genomics, in allowing us to rapidly identify the
              precise molecular weight of proteins and peptides, as well as their modified
              forms, and facilitate ongoing studies in the identification of plant gene
              function.  The Arabidopsis genome sequencing project is ca. 50% completed
              already, and the entire 100 Megabase genome is expected to be completed within
              the follow two years.  Knowledge of the complete sequence allows us to utilize
              the mass spectrometer in a very time and resource efficient manner and opens
              new avenues for exploring the molecular basis for plant growth and development.
