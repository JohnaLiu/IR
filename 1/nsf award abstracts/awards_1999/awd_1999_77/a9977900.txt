SNYDER 

Mike Snyder, of the Directorate for International Programs,
              and other staff of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
              (AAAS) will develop and implement a process to select and support U.S.
              delegations to participate in the second, third, and fourth Youth Science
              Festivals sponsored by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).  The
              second Festival is scheduled for summer 2000 in Singapore, and it is
              anticipated that future festivals will be held at two-year intervals, with
              Thailand and Australia having expressed interest in hosting the next two
              events.  AAAS's work for each festival will follow a  two-year cycle.  AAAS
              will select delegations of 20 high school students and 5 adult chaperones from
              among candidates nominated by members of a diverse network of organizations
              advancing science education in U.S. high schools.   The participants, who will
              have demonstrated success in science competitions, will be representative of
              the spectrum of the U.S. population and geography.  In addition to
              administering orientation, educational, and logistical matters before and
              during the Festival, AAAS will execute a media strategy to leverage the
              Festival experience beyond the participants and their families.  AAAS will also
              develop and manage post-Festival activities to encourage the participants to
              continue and build on their Festival experience for future educational and
              career directions.
