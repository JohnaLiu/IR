This award to Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
              University in the City of New York provides funds to develop and build ocean
              bottom seismometer instruments to conduct research in the structure of earth's
              crust and mantle as well as earthquake dynamics in the marine environment.  The
              award provides funds to build thirty-nine new instruments; together with
              existing instruments it will provide a pool of 63 seismometers suitable for use
              throughout the world ocean which will be operated by LDEO under cooperative
              agreement (separate from this award) with NSF. The seismometers will be
              available to qualified researchers from throughout the US academic community. 
              The project is collaboratively supported by three programs within the Division
              of Ocean Sciences at NSF (Marine Geology and Geophysics, Ocean Drilling,
              Oceanographic Instrumentation Programs).  Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory will
              provide cost-share support for more than 30% of total project costs.
