Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for the purchase of a multi-photon microscope to be
              conveniently located near two of the major Penn Institutes whose faculty will
              share the equipment. Some 14 users from the School of Engineering and Applied
              Science, the School of Medicine, and several campus institutes will use the
              equipment for biomedical and biomaterial research investigations. The new
              equipment offers significant advantages over existing equipment in imaging
              penetration depth, sensitivity, photodamage, and the ability to observe
              multiple fluorophores simultaneously. Specific studies include the effect of
              environmental stimuli on cells, the microscopic basis of biomaterial behavior,
              polymer behavior at interfaces, etc. The facility will be made available to
              researchers at nearby Universities.
