The University of Oklahoma (UO) will
              purchase an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) system.  The acquisition of
              the XPS system will complement existing modern instrumentation at the
              university used for the characterization of materials and processes in a number
              of disciplines. This instrument will be capable of providing a detailed
              characterization of the chemical composition and physico-chemical state of the
              surface of almost any material.     Among the key research areas identified for
              use of this instrument are energy-related projects, materials science research
              and research related to environmental issues.  A number of active projects,
              involving the characterization of heterogeneous catalysts, polymers,
              semi-conductors, and other electronic materials will greatly benefit from the
              availability of this instrument. This instrument will aid in accomplishing
              several important research and educational goals of the School of Chemical
              Engineering and Materials Science (CEMS)  and more widely at the University of
              Oklahoma.
