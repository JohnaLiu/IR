Abstract    :
              9977509

This proposal describes a multi-user confocal laser scanning
              microscope (CLSM) facility at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) that
              will allow for new lines of research and improve current research programs
              across an immense range of scientific inquiry.  The CLSM facility will be
              housed in the Department of Biological Sciences (DBS) on UNLV's campus and will
              consist of a confocal laser scanning microscope and a stand-alone
              epifluorescent microscope.  The implementation of a multi-user facility will
              enable users to address scientific problems requiring high resolution imaging
              of fixed and living specimens.  The multi-user facility will involve users from
              three different educational systems within the Nevada university system (UNLV,
              University of Nevada Reno, and the University of Nevada School of Medicine)
              encompassing areas of biology, chemistry and engineering.  Bringing together
              users form different university systems and a broad range of scientific inquiry
              will promote collaborative efforts and encourage interdisciplinary studies.  A
              CLSM facility will also strengthen the transship of postdoctoral associates,
              and graduate and undergraduate students, improving their competitive ability.
