Abstract    :
              Stuart Rice is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to perform experimental and theoretical studies of the
              properties of quasi-two dimensional systems.  The systems to be studied are
              suspensions of uncharged monodisperse colloid particles in very thin cells. 
              The proposed experimental studies will be based on digital video microscopy
              measurements, and use will be made of an optical tweezer to perform trapping
              experiments.   Theoretical simulations will be used to extend the theory of
              transport in colloid suspensions to include structural fluctuations.  Various
              applications of density functional theory will also be used to study the phase
              diagram of quasi-two dimensional systems.  Particular questions to be addressed
              include: 1) the changes induced in structures of quasi-two dimensional phases,
              and the character of the transitions between those phases as a function of
              constraints associated with confinement; 2) the density dependence of the
              relaxation processes, and the onset of glass formation; 3) how relaxation
              processes in colloid suspensions are influenced by a transition from quasi-two
              dimensional to three dimensional confinement; and 4) how the range of
              colloid-colloid interaction influences the structure and dynamical behavior of
              quasi-two dimensional suspensions.

The proposed studies will lead to a
              deeper understanding of the properties of liquid systems that, because they are
              constrained to two dimensional motion, exhibit unique thermodynamic behavior. 
              This work may have important applications in the development of new materials
              or specialized devices.
