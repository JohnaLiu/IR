Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) and Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs, the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayaguez will upgrade its NMR
              facility.  This equipment will enhance research in the following areas:  1)
              synthesis, characterization and metal-DNA studies of titanonece antitumor
              agents; 2) synthesis and characterization of Ru(V) complexes as
              radiopharmaceuticals; 3) synthesis of symmetrical bis-partial intercalators and
              study of their effects on nucleic acid conformation; 4) mechanism upon
              substitution of H2S by oxygen binding to an unusual hemoglobin; 5) natural
              products; 6) synthesis and DNA interaction of Pt(II) complexes with
              heteroaromatic ligands; and 7) unsaturated organometallic complexes as C-H
              activators.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers,
              catalysis, and in biology.
