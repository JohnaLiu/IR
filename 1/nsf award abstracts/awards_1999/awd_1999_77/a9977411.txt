Abstract    :
              This MRI award will be used to purchase a modern parallel processor computer
              system for use in modeling of a variety of space physics and space weather
              related topics.  Specific topics that will be investigated using this system
              include:  (1) the global, dynamic interaction of the Earth's magnetosphere with
              the solar wind, (2) the development of intense radiation in the inner
              magnetosphere during magnetic storms, and (3) the association of intense
              electric fields and currents with resonant auroral arcs in the ionosphere.  In
              addition to being an important tool for fundamental research on space physics,
              the computer will be used to train students in the use of large, modern
              simulation codes and parallel computing techniques.
