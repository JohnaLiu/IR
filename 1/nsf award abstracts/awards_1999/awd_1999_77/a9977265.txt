This
              Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a
              two-component fiber-optic Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) system, along with a
              precise three-axis traversing system, for pointwise measurements of velocity
              fields in aqueous and gaseous flows.  The LDV system will be utilized in
              several ongoing fundamental research projects ranging from the study of
              superheated droplets in supersonic flow to the flow around an inflating
              parachute canopy in incompressible flow.  These research projects involve
              interdisciplinary research activities at both graduate and undergraduate
              levels.  The LDV system will also significantly enhance the future research and
              graduate student training capabilities of the Aerospace and Hydrodynamics
              Laboratories in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Worcester Polytechnic
              Institute.
