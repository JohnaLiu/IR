Abstract

	The rapid pace of accumulation of information regarding
              the repertoire of genes in multiple organisms from bacteria to humans is
              beginning to revolutionize biology.  The knowledge of these genes and their
              sequences has made it possible to undertake genome-wide analyses of gene
              expression and regulation, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, transcriptional
              profiling in toxicology, and in drug discovery.  Many of these advances have
              been made feasible by DNA microarray technology in which collections of DNAs of
              interest are arrayed on small slides or filters.  These arrays are hybridized
              to fluorescently-labeled DNA or RNA probes and the signals scanned and analyzed
              using sophisticated microarray scanners and software packages.  This project
              involves the acquisition, and use of a 768 well thermal cycler for generation
              of DNA samples to be arrayed; a microarrayer for generation of DNA arrays; a
              scanner for quantitation of the hybridization signals; software for the
              analysis of data; and technical support for the operation of the machines. 
              Projects to utilize this instrumentation include studies of the regulation of
              polarity and the actin cytoskeleton in early C. Elegans development;
              identification of Toll pathway components; peroxisome biogenesis and
              degradation in Pichia pastoris; identification of forespore-expressed genes
              required for engulfment during Bacillus subtilis sporulation; and other
              projects being developed by both major and minor users.
