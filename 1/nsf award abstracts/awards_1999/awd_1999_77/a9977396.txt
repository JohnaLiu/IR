Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Arizona State University will purchase a
              cluster of high performance PCs that will be dedicated to the support of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for
              interdisciplinary-focused research projects. These projects include,
*
              Integrated Intelligent Modeling, Design and Control of Crystal Growth
              Processes
* Mathematical Studies in Brain Dynamics
* Analysis of
              Spatiotemporal Data from Complex Dynamical Systems
* Parallel Optimization for
              Reconstruction, Quantification and Segmentation
* Nonparametric Function and
              Variance Estimation

Parallelism will be exploited on coarse granularity
              problems to achieve high-speed large-scale computation for relatively low cost
              by networking a cluster of PCs  using the Beowulf system. The acquisition of
              this cluster will also impact and enhance research activities of other
              departmental research groups, comprising faculty, postdoctoral visitors and
              graduate students, in computational fluid dynamics, discrete mathematics, and
              number theory. 

In support of the research activities, a Systems
              Administrator will be hired 50% on NSF funds for the first two years. This
              position will be regularized to university funds in
