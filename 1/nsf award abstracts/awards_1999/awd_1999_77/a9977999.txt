Abstract    :
              Reputation systems provide information about the past behavior of  individuals
              or institutions. This information can help decision-makers choose partners for
              transactions. In addition, concern for one's reputation and its future
              consequences can constrain behavior.  While word of mouth always disseminates
              reputations informally, computer networks can now vastly accelerate and add
              structure to the process, gathering information about past behavior swiftly and
              systematically, and distributing it to a broad audience. The proposed research
              seeks to: characterize the alternative designs for reputation systems; use game
              theory to understand alternative models of reputation systems; and examine
              empirically the performance of systems at work. The research should improve the
              design of reputation systems for computer-assisted marketplaces, thereby
              helping buyers and sellers find their most appropriate partners and reducing
              the risks inherent in interactions with strangers.
