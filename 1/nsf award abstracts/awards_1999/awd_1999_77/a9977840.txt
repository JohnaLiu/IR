This award provides partial support for conference
              registration fees and travel costs for undergraduate and graduate students. 
              The conference builds on the success of the First Tennessee Conference on
              Biomedical Engineering (1998) with the goals being 1- to foster collaborative
              efforts among industrial, academic, and clinical institutions involved in
              biomedical engineering, and 2- to increase the awareness of biomedical
              engineering activities in the Tennessee Valley.

The meeting includes a
              session on the regional development of a biotechnology infrastructure and
              another on the Impact of High Technology on Health Care Delivery.  Also, other
              sessions are scheduled to provide undergraduate and graduate students with an
              overview of professional alternatives for biomedical engineers.

Information
              about the meeting has been disseminated by a printed conference announcement
              and a WEB page at URL <http://www.bme.vanderbilt.edu/tnbme2/>.  Results from
              the meeting will contribute to research program planning and the assessment of
              new technologies in health care.  Conference proceedings, including abstracts
              for poster sessions, are to be published.
