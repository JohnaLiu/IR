Abstract    :
              New instruments will be designed and constructed to measure the liquid water and
              the ice content of atmospheric clouds together with the shape and density of
              ice particles.  The instruments will be deployed in the field both at the
              earth's surface and in aircraft to characterize clouds from the standpoints of
              aircraft icing, radiative transfer, and precipitation and thunderstorm
              processes.  Emphasis is on the characterization of mixed-phase clouds, in which
              ice crystals and liquid drops coexist.   The cloud probe collects either ice
              and water or ice alone, depending on the configuration of the collector.  The
              precipitation probe collects particles at the stagnation point of a
              forward-facing sapphire window and records their images on a video camera. 
              Both instruments work on the principle of particle collection on a surface
              maintained at constant temperature.  The power required to hold the temperature
              steady is proportional to the latent heat of vaporization of the collected
              material, and hence the particle mass per unit volume of air.  These
              instruments will be applied to investigations of chemical, radiative, and
              electrical processes in the little-studied mixed-phase regions of clouds.
