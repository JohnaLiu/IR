Abstract    :
              As next generation high performance networks are deployed and it becomes
              practical to move large amounts of data over the internet, scientists and
              engineers will have the ability for the first time to analyze and mine remote
              and distributed data in casual way.

Data mining in the semi-automatic
              discovery of patterns, associations, changes, and anomalies is large data sets.
               Traditionally, in a broad sense, statistics had focused on the
              assumption-driven analysis of data, while data mining has focused on the
              discovery analysis of data.  By discovery-driven, the proposers mean the
              semi-automatic search for interesting patterns and models.

This project will
              develop software tools, performance monitoring tools, network services and
              network protocols for distributed data analysis and data mining using emerging
              high performance networks.  The project director proposes to test the
              technologies that are developed using a global testbed being built called the
              Terabyte Challenge Testbed (TCTB).  Today over twenty scientists from seven
              institutions over three continents are working in the TCTB.  The project
              director proposes to substantially expand the TCTB with this proposal to
              demonstrate the practically of distributed data mining.
