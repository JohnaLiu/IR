The objective is to
              systematically verify the principle of operation of a back scattering acoustic
              sensor for sediment transport.   By using multiple sound frequencies one may
              obtain information on both concentration and particle size, for various
              penetration distances up to the order of several meters.  The expected spatial
              (about 1 cm) and temporal (about 0.1 seconds) resolutions are suitable for
              sediment transport studies in channels and rivers.  The investigation will be
              performed both in laboratory and field settings.  Measurements with isokinetic
              probes and other sampling techniques will be used as reference data to
              calibrate the new device in the suspension streams.  The project will provide
              student support in the University of Mississippi for performing the tests in
              collaboration with the Department of Agriculture National Sediment Laboratory,
              and National Center for Physical Acoustics.  It will strengthen the
              infrastructure in the university with immediate use in other research projects.
               The project has a strong educational component.  If successful, it will
              contribute to the development of a nonintrusive instrument to monitor suspended
              particulate matter in channels and rivers, and will contribute to
              infrastructure development in the University.
