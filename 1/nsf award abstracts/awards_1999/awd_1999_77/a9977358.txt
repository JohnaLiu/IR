The recent development of femtosecond lasers, which produce
              light pulses shorter than one trillionth of a second, creates new opportunities
              for science and technology.  Experiments performed using a femtosecond laser
              allow scientists to study ultrafast phenomena.  Femtosecond pulses are ideal
              light source for nonlinear optical research.  Funds from the Major Research
              Instrumentation program will be used to acquire a femtosecond laser system
              (50-fs pulse width, 82-MHz repetition rate, tunable from 360 to 450 nm and from
              720 to 950 nm).  Six faculty members at two colleges of New Mexico State
              University (NMSU) will use this instrument for research in the emerging
              technology of photonics, which promises to acquire, store, process, and
              transmit information much faster than today's computers.  The research projects
              in which this laser will be used include materials with high optical
              nonlinearity, laser emission from microcavities filled with nanostructured
              silver aggregates, and to study the ultrafast all-optical switch developed at
              the Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of NMSU.  This
              state-of-the-art laser will be used by many of the 6 undergraduate students, 21
              graduate students and 2 visiting scientists at the investigators research
              groups (6 Hispanic and 6 women) in their thesis projects.  Other students at
              NMSU (a Carnegie I research institution, a land-grant educational institution,
              and a minority institution) will also benefit directly in their education
              through the use of this instrument at two laboratory courses designed for
              graduate students and senior undergraduate students. 

A femtosecond laser
              will be acquired with Major Research Instrumentation program funds.  This
              instrument will be used by six researchers in projects on photonic materials,
              which is important in information technology.  The instrumentation will have a
              significant impact on the research infrastructure at New Mexico State
              University, which is a minority institution.
