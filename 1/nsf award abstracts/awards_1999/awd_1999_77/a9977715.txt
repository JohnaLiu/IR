Abstract

	This project involves the acquisition, installation and
              use of a low vacuum, high resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) with
              cryostage and x-ray microanalysis capabilities.  There are currently over 30
              scientists and a significant number of students and post-doctoral fellows on
              the campus of Kansas State University using SEMs for research in biological,
              physical, chemical and engineering specimens.  None of the SEMs currently
              available is state-of-the-art and several of them are outdated, very difficult
              to use and maintain and provide relatively poor image quality.  The new SEM
              will revitalize these research programs providing them with modern imaging
              capabilities and the ability to image in low vacuum, cryo-conditions and with
              x-ray microanalysis.  This microscope will be used for research in a broad
              range of areas including insect genetic regulatory mechanisms; sensory
              receptors and cues for oviposition by moths and butterflies;
              geotechnical/geoenvironmental engineering; molluscan biomineralization;
              analysis of extruded food products; synthesis, properties and applications of
              hydrogels; function of insect blood cells; phenotypes of mutant Arabidopsis
              floral organs;  and plant defense response and regulated secretions.
