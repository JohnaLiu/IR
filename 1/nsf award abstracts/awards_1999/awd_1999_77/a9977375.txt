Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for an inductively-coupled mass spectrometer equipped with
              an electrothermal vaporization system and flow injection system to enhance the
              research efforts of faculty members in the Center for Environmental Science and
              Engineering. Research projects that will utilize the equipment include
              biogeochemical research in forest ecosystems, water quality problems in Lake
              Onondaga, water and sediment chemistry in the Adirondacks, and the
              biodegradation of halocarbons in the environment.
