This Major Research Instrumentation award to California State
              University at Long Beach provides an inductively coupled plasma-mass
              spectrometer for a highly multi- and inter-disciplinary set of earth, ocean and
              environmental sciences research as well as biological, chemical and
              archeological study.  It will be used for a wide variety of research projects
              by investigators from several CSULB departments and other CSU campuses, and it
              will be integrated into undergraduate education and training .  The project is
              supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. California State University
              will provide cost-share support for more than 40% of total project
              costs.
