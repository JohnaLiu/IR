This Major Research Instrumentation award to Oregon State
              University provides a high resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass
              spectrometer for oceanographic and environmental sciences research.  It will be
              used for a wide variety of research projects, and will be integrated into a
              facility which is heavily used by OSU researchers, as well as available to
              outside researchers on a cost-recovery basis.  The project is supported by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.  Oregon State University will provide
              cost-share support for 30% of total project costs.
