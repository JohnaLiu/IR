Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Boston University will purchase
              computing equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment consists of one SUN HPC450 (with 2 x 512
              Mbytes RAM, 9.1 Gbyte disks, dual 400 MHz processors), two SUN Ultra 60's (each
              with 2 x 512 Mbytes RAM, 9.1 Gbyte disks, dual 360 MHz processors), and a SUN
              Enterprise 250 file server (with dual 300 MHz processors).  Boston University
              will provide a cost-sharing commitment of 50% of the total acquisition cost. 
              The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in
              particular: (1) massive iterations of complex analytic functions and the
              visualization of their dynamics (R. L. Devaney); (2) computationally intensive
              hierarchical statistical modeling of time series and images (M. E. Glickman and
              E. D. Kolaczyk); (3) numerical studies of pattern formation and
              self-replicating spots (T. J. Kaper); (4) symbolic computation in geometry and
              topology (T. Kimura); (5) laarge-scale simulations and visualization for
              differential equation models in neurophysiology focusing on electrical activity
              in hippocampal neurons (N. Kopell, M. S. Olufsen, J. A. White).
