Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
              Department of Chemistry at Colorado School of Mines acquire a Matrix-Assisted
              Laser Desorption Ionization/Time of Flight (MALDI/TOF) Mass Spectrometer. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas, including (a) coupling
              field-flow fractionation w/MALDI for analysis of bacteria & synthetic polymers;
              (b) fragmentation and ionization modes in the MALDI of bacterial proteins; (c)
              molecular weight and chemical species determination in unique polymer systems;
              and (d) characterization of microbial communities by MALDI of amplified &
              digested 16S rDNA.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
              intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
              array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules.
