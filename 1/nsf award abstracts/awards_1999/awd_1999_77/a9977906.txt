Abstract    :
              The United States of America will host the 42nd International Mathematical
              Olympiad (IMO) in the year 2001 in Washington DC.  The IMO is the premier
              international mathematics competition for high school students and it will
              bring to the USA more than 500 of the most talented high school age
              mathematicians from more than 80 countries.  The American mathematics community
              will use this opportunity to promote the importance of mathematics for all
              students and to celebrate the accomplishments of our best and brightest
              students.
For the American mathematics community, the IMO provides an
              opportunity to promote the importance of a strong mathematics education for all
              students--much like the Olympics are used to promote physical fitness for
              all--and to celebrate the outstanding achievements of our nation's young men
              and women in mathematics.
Funding from the National Science Foundation will
              support the office and staff that will plan and manage the event to provide a
              part of the participant support.  This funding comes from the Infrastructure
              Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).  Staff will work with volunteers and the
              Board of directors of IMO 2001 USA Inc to coordinate the outreach activities,
              solicit corporate sponsors and promote research efforts.
The goal of this
              project is to organize and put on the IMO in the USA, to use this opportunity
              to promote excellence in mathematics among all students, and to study the
              characteristics of an international sample of exceptional mathematics students
              and attempt to understand how to identify and nurture such students, no matter
              the seting in which they may appear.
