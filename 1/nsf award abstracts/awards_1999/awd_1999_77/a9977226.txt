Acquisition of
              Equipment for a Molecular Genetics Laboratory to Support Research and Training.
               

This award provides funds to equip a molecular genetics laboratory that
              will serve as a regional resource for research and training.  The focal point
              of the award is a Perkin-Elmer ABI 310 automated DNA analyzer, which is capable
              of a number of different DNA analyses using non-radioactive chemistry.  The
              ability to use non-radioactive methods for DNA analyses alleviates the
              logistical problems with maintaining a radioisotope license and will allow the
              integration of more molecular applications into student training and research.
              At the present time there is no such facility in the state of South Dakota.
              This facility will support research in conservation genetics, molecular
              systematics, and molecular ecology, while enhancing undergraduate curricula and
              opportunities for collaboration among faculty. This award will enhance the
              research of four university faculty at Black Hills State University, a wildlife
              biologist for the state of South Dakota, and a scientist at the Black Hills
              Regional Eye Institute. The award will also improve research and training
              opportunities for students at area universities and complement existing
              projects.  For example, Black Hills State University is in the process of
              implementing a NSF-CCLI award in conservation genetics in collaboration with
              Oglala Lakota College on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.  The availability
              of an automated DNA analyzer will significantly improve the research and
              training infrastructure in the state of South Dakota.
