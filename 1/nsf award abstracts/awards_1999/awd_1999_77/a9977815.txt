MRI: 
              Acquisition of a Cluster of Symmetric Multiprocessors

The purpose of this
              proposal is to set up a high performance  computing cluster consisting of
              symmetric multiprocessors connected by a high speed switched network to support
              research and training in an advanced parallel programming environment. The
              specific goals include: 1) develop programming environments to effectively use
              a cluster of multiprocessors for scientific computing, 2) develop general
              computer programs for modeling and simulation, 3) educate students in the field
              of computational science and engineering and 4) perform numerically intensive
              calculations in the research areas of electronic structure theory; classical,
              semi-classical and quantum molecular dynamics simulations; Monte Carlo
              simulations of electronic devices; and the development of powerful procedures
              for automatic parallelization. These goals will be achieved through the
              proposed Automatic Parallelization Environment or Network of Workstations
              programming environment.
