This project will establish an Interdisciplinary Research
              Group in advanced semiconductors in Kansas to forward research in the group
              III-nitride wide band gap semiconductors, a category of which is recognized as
              integral to the fabrication of certain optoelectronic and electronic devices
              capable of operating under high power and high temperature conditions.  Despite
              the strong progress made in this research area, further problems still exist
              which have to do with materials quality and structure.  Devices built with
              III-nitride materials will advance technological improvements in systems
              related to communications, transportation and energy.  The integrative effort
              as represented in this project by the scientists and engineers from diverse
              backgrounds is necessary in order to develop innovative approaches to
              synthesizing materials, and developing state-of-the-art facilities and
              specialized instrumentation not achievable in a single investigator program. 
              Commitment of NSF EPSCoR funds to this project will also reinforce further
              investments by universities and the State of Kansas in the area of advanced
              semiconductors.
