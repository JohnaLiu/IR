              ABSTRACT

OCE-9977103

This work will study the impact of dust on the marine
              Si cycle using a Ge/Si mass balance approach coupled with laboratory
              dissolution experiments.  The laboratory work will be an experimental study of
              Si and Ge dissolution from aerosols during reaction with rainwater and
              seawater,  by which changes in aerosol composition after the particles reach
              the surface ocean can be assessed. Additionally, through studies on the eolian
              component of pelagic sediments, sediment trap samples, and seawater, the PI
              would construct a Ge-Si mass balance between aerosols and sediments to
              constrain the Si flux from dust to the oceans.  Because the wind regime and
              associated dust input into the ocean between glacial and interglacial periods
              is likely very different, this study could have important implication to
              understanding biogeochemical changes associated with glacial/interglacial
              cycles.
