Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs, the Department of
              Chemistry at Lewis and Clark College will upgrade an  existing 300 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer and acquire a glove box. This equipment will enhance research in
              the synthesis of two classes of compounds:  a)  organometallic compounds for
              investigations of organometallic-promoted phosphoester bond cleavage; and b)
              ruthenium heteropolytungstates complexes for potential use as catalysts for
              oxidative degradation of hydrocarbon waste.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
              frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
              such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
