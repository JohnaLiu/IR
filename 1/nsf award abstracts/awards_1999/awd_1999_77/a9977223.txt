Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project is an analysis of the link between the growth
              of the Cold War aerospace/defense industry and the rise of a distinct and key
              part of the American suburban middle class. This project's final product will
              be a historical narrative based on an extensive examination of published and
              unpublished government and aerospace company documents and the critical
              recollections and analyses of former aerospace engineers and production
              workers. More specifically, the project focuses on the impact of the U.S. civil
              space program on American society, the public and private lives of aerospace
              engineers and production workers, the effects of state-sponsored science and
              technology on engineers and technical laborers, the complexities of American
              middle class identity, the meanings of American patriotism, and the realities
              of corporate welfarism from the late 1950s through the early 1970s. It is a
              study of the socioeconomic, cultural, and professional lives of the engineers
              and production workers of the Grumman Aerospace Corporation's Space Division
              from the birth of the Space Age in 1957, through their triumphs with the Apollo
              Lunar Modules and Orbiting Astronomical Observatories during the 1960s and
              early 1970s, to the company's loss of the space shuttle contract and its layoff
              of one out of every three employees by the recession of 1973. This project will
              provide an overview of what aerospace engineers' and production workers' lives
              were like during the "glory days" of the Apollo program and an examination of
              how a number of Americans personally profited from the Cold War because of
              their work for the U.S. civil space program. Support for this dissertation
              research project will facilitate the completion of this project by providing
              funds to primarily conduct a survey and interviews of  Gumman engineers.
