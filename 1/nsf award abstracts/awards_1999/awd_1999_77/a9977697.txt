This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI) Program, provides partial support of the costs of acquiring a high
              performance computer system for the Center for Computational Geophysics (CCG),
              Rice University.  The CCG will obtain a multi-CPU, shared memory, parallel
              architecture server which will be used in a variety of computer intensive
              geophysical research programs including 3-D reflection and refraction
              exploration seismology and geodynamic modeling.   A number of faculty members
              will make use this state-of-the-art computational platform.  William Symes
              (applied mathematician), Alan Levander (seismologist) and Richard Baraniuk
              (signal processing electrical engineer) will largely be involved in development
              of improved computational algorithms for inversion of large 3-D seismic data
              sets and their interpretation.  Additional faculty members and researchers
              including Richard Gordon, Adrian Lenardic, Julia Morgan and Dale Sawyer will
              make use of the system for modeling geodynamic processes.  Specific geoscience
              applications include improvements to the NUVEL-1 global plate motion model,
              tomographic imaging of the roots of the Rocky Mountains, profiling continental
              margin sedimentation and structure, modeling the physics of landslides, and
              simulating the geodynamics of continental rifting, seafloor spreading, mantle
              convection and plate motions.
