This Major Research Instrumentation award to Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts provides a 400 MHz digital nuclear
              magnetic resonance spectrometer for biogeochemical research in ocean and
              environmental sciences.  It will be used for a variety of research projects by
              investigators from WHOI and several nearby universities, including study of
              dissolved marine organic matter composition and cycling, and the role of
              organic nitrogen in stimulating harmful algal blooms in coastal areas heavily
              impacted by anthropogenically-derived nutrient inputs.  The project is
              supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution will provide cost-share support for more 30% of total project
              costs.
