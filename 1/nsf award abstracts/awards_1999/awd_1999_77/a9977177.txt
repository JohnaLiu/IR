Abstract    :
              Research Computing in the Cornell Mathematics Department


The Department of
              Mathematics at Cornell University will purchase a powerful compute server,
              storage, backup, workstations with shared facilities and color print services,
              which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical
              sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including
              in particular: the study of various aspects of dynamical systems, computational
              symbolic algorithms in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, stochastic
              spatial models in probability, problems of enumeration in polyhedral
              combinatorics and hyperplane arrangements, and problems concerning the
              stability of configurations of points in space under natural distance
              constraints.
