This project provides support for acquisition of a universal
              MTS (Materials Testing Systems) loading machine which will be used to support a
              wide range of testing schemes that cannot be achieved using existing
              facilities. The system will have axial and torsional loading capabilities and
              will allow both monotonic (static) and cyclic (dynamic) loading. Research
              projects which will  have use of the equipment include characterization of the
              tensile properties of geosynthetics, mechanical response of ceramic matrix
              composites, dynamics of bolted joints and assemblies, and bonding behavior of
              concrete to  carbon-fiber reinforced polymers. The new equipment will
              significantly improve the laboratory testing capability at the University of
              Southern Florida and will eliminate an existing gap in presently-available
              loading frames in terms of loading mode (torsion), range, sensitivity, data
              acquisition, and automated mechanical control. In addition, the universal
              nature of the device will foster cross-disciplinary collaboration between
              faculty in the Civil, Mechanical, and other engineering departments within the
              campus. This project is an equipment grant supported under the MRI Program.***
