Abstract    :
              	The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) was founded in 1994 and is a
              collaborative program of cross-national research among national election
              studies conducted in over fifty consolidated and emerging democracies.  The
              goals of this unique program of research are three fold:  illuminate how
              electoral institutions constrain the beliefs and behaviors of citizens to
              condition the nature and quality of democratic choice as expressed through
              popular elections; understand the nature of political and social cleavages and
              alignments; and shed light on how citizens, living under diverse political
              arrangements, evaluate democratic institutions and processes.  By coordinating
              the collection of electoral data across polities, CSES strives to advance the
              understanding of enduring and fundamental debates about electoral behavior in a
              way not possible through the secondary analysis of existing data.  Social
              scientists from around the world have collaborated to specify the research
              agenda, the study design, the micro- and macro-level data that indigenous teams
              of researchers collect within each policy, and the standards and procedures
              that are used for data collection and management.  The data include a common
              module of questions placed on the national election survey of each affiliate
              country; a common set of macro-level indicators regarding the nature of the
              electoral system, parties, candidates, and related matters; and an archive of
              documents, such as electoral statutes and party platforms and manifestos, that
              can inform or become part of the data base that researchers use.
