              Abstract

This award will provide partial support for the purchase of  a wafer
              probe test station, control computer, and associated electronics.  These will
              allow the University of California Observatories, Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick)
              to continue its forefront development of CCD imaging detectors for astronomical
              research.  This instrumentation will be available as a Santa Cruz campus
              resource for other faculty and students.  It will be used in UCO/Lick programs
              with the University of California, Berkeley and Lawerence Berkeley National
              Laboratory as well as programs with University of California, Davis and several
              other institutions around the country.
