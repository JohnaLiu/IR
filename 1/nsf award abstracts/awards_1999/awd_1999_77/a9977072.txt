Abstract    :
              This project explores the evolutionary processes that generate and maintain
              diversity and counteract the effects of extinction.  Alternative models for
              rainforest speciation will be examined through a parallel series of integrated
              studies of rainforests worldwide.  Within a multidisciplinary collaborative
              framework, these investigators will increase our understanding of how
              rainforest biodiversity is generated by achieving three goals.  First, they
              will identify general evolutionary processes that promote speciation and
              phenotypic diversity.  Second,  they will identify landscape configurations
              essential to speciation.  Third, they will test alternative speciation
              hypotheses across diverse vertebrate groups on three continents.   The study
              will involve four vertebrate groups (mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians)
              in tropical rainforests in Australia, West Africa and South America.

 In
              addition to the scientific goals of this research there are also
              conservation-related goals.  The investigators will develop conservation
              strategies that protect key evolutionary processes and develop conservation
              plans that preserve evolutionary processes as well as current patterns of
              diversity.   The loss of rainforest biodiversity is one of the most critical
              issues facing humankind.  This research will build an understanding of the
              evolutionary processes underlying rainforest diversity and develop concrete
              plans to preserve them.
