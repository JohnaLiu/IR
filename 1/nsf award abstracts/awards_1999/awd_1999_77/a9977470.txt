Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to complete the acquisition of a scanning probe microscope
              system including near-field scanning microscope capabilities. The equipment,
              part of which has already been purchased and the remainder loaned from the
              manufacturers, will be used on a number of biomaterial and surface studies.
              Some specific examples include studies of silk-like protein fibers and films,
              biomineralized composite materials, in-situ observations of crystallization
              processes, and surface characteristics of film optical devices. The equipment
              will be included in the laboratory component of several graduate and
              undergraduate courses in Electro-Optics and Chemical Engineering.
