This project will establish an interdisciplinary research
              program on nanomaterials at Clemson University.   The State of South Carolina
              has identified the development of advanced materials as a priority research
              area critical to the state's future economic growth.  Nanomaterials research
              covers a broad area in science and technology.  The project will establish a
              coherent interdisciplinary research team involving faculty groups from
              chemistry, chemical engineering, physics, and materials science and
              engineering.  The research team this project will focus on development of
              methods for producing bulk quantities of organic and inorganic nanomaterials. 
              They will use a new method for the preparation of nanoparticles based on a
              modification to the rapid expansion of supercritical fluid solutions (RESS)
              technique.   Potential uses of nanomaterials as optical biosensors and potent
              optical limiters will be explored.  In addition, investigations of
              nanocomposite materials will be conducted for novel magnetic properties and
              their potential applications in the development of high-efficiency
              photoconductors and photovoltaic devices.  NSF funding will support the hiring
              and start-up costs of a new faculty member as well as providing research and
              educational opportunities for a number of graduate and undergraduate
              students.
