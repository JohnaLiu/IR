This project provides technical assistance support to
              the participating states in NSF's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive
              Research (EPSCoR).  The intent of the project is assisting the EPSCoR states in
              the development of research proposals in order to strengthen the research
              competitiveness of these states.   The project's goal is to increase the EPSCoR
              states' competitiveness to the point that their probability of receiving
              funding is indistinguishable for non-EPSCoR states.    The technical assistance
              will focus on working with the states to identify new opportunities for
              funding, and large-scale programs that represent significant potential growth
              areas for increased competitiveness.   The P.I.s will focus their efforts in
              four target areas: 1) Computing/Networking Infrastructure;
              2)Biotechnology/Biocomplexity and Environmental Research; 3) Materials Science
              and Engineering; and 4) Economic Development Initiatives.  The project will be
              operated as a partnership with the EPSCoR states.  Project staff will work
              closely with EPSCoR leaders in each state to choose those areas of emphasis
              that are important to that state.
