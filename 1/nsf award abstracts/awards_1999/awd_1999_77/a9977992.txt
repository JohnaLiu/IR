Abstract    :
                  The research funded by this proposal will focus on unresolved questions
              about the chemistry of ozone catalysis (HOx, NOx, and ClOx) in the lower
              stratosphere. Laboratory experiments will address rate constants and mechanisms
              of reactions including OH+NO2, OH+HONO2, O+O3, Cl+RH, Cl+O3, and OH+HCl over
              the pressure and temperature ranges of the lower stratosphere, (50-200 torr).
              Experiments will employ a high pressure flow (HPF) technique, producing data
              that is distinct from and independent of pulsed laser photolysis studies. The
              HPF method enables rigorously wall-less experiments at arbitrary temperatures,
              while retaining the advantages of well-defined thermal radical distributions
              with no interference from other reagents. Radical measurements will be carried
              out with a combination of laser in-duced fluorescence (LIF), resonance
              fluorescence (RF), and infrared cavity ringdown laser absorption spectroscopy
              (IR-CRLAS). In situ FTIR absorption and in situ GC/MS analysis will insure both
              accurate quantification of molecular species and strict exclusion of
              contaminants, and laser doppler velocimetry will provide highly accurate
              velocity measurements.   The experimental work will be combined with
              theoretical calculations to provide insight into the factors controlling these
              rates and mechanisms, which in turn will greatly increase confidence in the
              data. These calculations will focus simultaneously on the factors governing the
              potential energy surface for each reaction and on the dynamics on each surface.
