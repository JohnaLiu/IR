Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Texas Tech University will
              purchase and assemble a 127-node parallel supercomputer which will be dedicated
              to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be
              used for several research projects, including in particular: Computational
              Methods for Simulating Musculoskeletal Dynamics and Human Motion, Coherent
              Structures in Boundary Layers; Numerical Approximation of Partial Differential
              Equations; Mathematical and Numerical Analysis of Tornado Dynamics; and Finite
              Element Analysis of Structural Acoustic Interactions under the Influence of
              Boundary Control.
