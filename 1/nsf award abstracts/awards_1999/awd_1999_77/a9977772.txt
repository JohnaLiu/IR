Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for the purchase of an environmental scanning electron
              microscope to be used in a new Micro-Environmental Imaging and Analysis
              Facility. Among the projects that would benefit from the new equipment are
              studies of biofilm mobility in the soil, non-viral gene delivery methods,
              protein-inorganic biomineralization, and nanobiofabrication techniques. The
              major benefit of the new equipment would be its ability to image delicate
              materials such as biologicals without introducing artifacts in the sample
              preparation process. Faculty from numerous departments including Materials,
              Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental
              Biology would utilize the equipment.
