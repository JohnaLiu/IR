Alabama industry produces significant amounts of waste
              containing metal ions such as mercury, arsenic, chromium, copper, cadmium,
              lead, antimony, and zinc.    Superfund sites in Alabama are on the National
              Priority List because of contamination from these ions.  This project is
              intended to help refocus the State's efforts from remediation of metal ion
              contamination to prevention of metal ion contamination. The State and its
              universities recognize that the key to developing a comprehensive agenda for
              pollution prevention in Alabama's industries lies in cooperative research and
              education initiatives.   In this project, interdisciplinary teams of experts
              and students in metal ion separations, speciation, modeling, transport,
              monitoring and remediation will be formed from five Alabama universities, two
              national laboratories, and four companies with ties to Alabama.  These teams
              will work directly with Alabama's industries to discover a molecular level
              understanding of the industrial processes that are responsible for metal ion
              contamination, thus facilitating the redesign of manufacturing technologies to
              prevent pollution and provide fundamental new information on metal ion
              separations.
