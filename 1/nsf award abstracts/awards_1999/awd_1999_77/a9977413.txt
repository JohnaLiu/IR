Yale University will acquire a
              modern, simultaneous multi-angle static and dynamic light scattering (SMSDLS)
              instrument. The SMSDLS will be used  for several ongoing and anticipated
              collaborative research projects involving colloidal research in disciplines
              such as chemical and biomedical engineering, applied physics and environmental
              engineering science. These projects include fundamental aspects of particle
              aggregation and deposition in natural surface waters, studying the effects of
              polyelectrolytes on colloidal stability and the nature of  protein
              crystallization and aggregation. The instrument will lead to significant
              advances in our ability to understand the kinetics of colloidal  and
              macromolecular phenomena in engineered and natural systems. The acquisition of
              the SMSDLS will also enhance the educational and research experience of
              undergraduate and graduate students in the various engineering and applied
              science departments at Yale University.
