Abstract    :
              The Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University will purchase a high-end
              multi processor computing and  visualization facility suitable for
              computationally intensive computing, postprocessing, and visualization of large
              data sets, which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be  used for several research
              projects, including in particular: Numerical Methods for Deterministic Optimal
              Control Problems, NSF Grant DMS-9704426 to Dupuis; High Order Methods for Shock
               Calculations and Computational Electromagnetics, NSF Grant DMS-9804985 to Shu
              and Gottlieb; Modeling Natural Image Statistics, NSF Grant DMS-9615444 to
              Mumford; Invariant Manifolds and Complex Behavior in Nonlinear Physical
              Systems, NSF Grant DMS-9800922 to Haller; and Continuum Physics and Systems of
              Conservation Laws, NSF Grant DMS-980352 to Dafermos.
