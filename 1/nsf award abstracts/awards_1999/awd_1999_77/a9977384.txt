Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics of the University of Wisconsin - Madison
will
              purchase the equipment:

1. Two four-processor computer servers, and 

2.
              Four smaller linked one-processor workstations, for visualization,

which
              will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical
sciences in a
              mathematics computation room. The equipment will be used
for several research
              projects, including in particular:

1. Computations in Wave Turbulence with
              applications to wave spectra of
ocean and atmospheric waves; 

2.
              Computations in Group Cohomology;

3. Modeling locomotion in ascaris;

4.
              Computations in Spatial Systems.
