This Major Research Instrumentation award to Scripps
              Institution of Oceanography at the Univeristy of California San Diego provides
              funds to develop and build ocean bottom seismometer instruments to conduct
              research in the structure of earth's crust and mantle as well as earthquake
              dynamics in the marine environment.  The award provides funds to build
              seventy-five new instruments; together with existing instruments it will
              provide a pool of 100 seismometers suitable for use throughout the world ocean
              which will be operated by SIO under cooperative agreement (separate from this
              award) with NSF.  The award also provides funds for related shipping
              containers, computers for data retrieval and operations, and other
              instrumentation to support the instruments.  The seismometers will be available
              to qualified researchers from throughout the US academic community.  The
              project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar
              Programs at NSF.  Scripps Institution of Oceanography will provide cost-share
              support for 30% of total project costs.
