Abstract    :
              This grant funds the development and construction of a silicon strip detector
              array for experiments with fast radioactive nuclear beams.  Such beams will
              soon be available, albeit with low intensities, at radioactive beam facilities
              and will allow important investigations in the areas of nuclear structure and
              nuclear astrophysics. To be useful at these facilities, detection arrays must
              cover most if not all of the interesting solid angle. This array does so with
              high resolution, and low cost by utilizing advanced high density readout
              electronics. Once constructed, the array will be a powerful research instrument
              for determining the structure of extremely neutron-rich or neutron-deficient
              nuclei. It will also enable the measurement of many nuclear properties that are
              relevant to the nucleosynthesis of the elements within stars, novae and
              supernovae.  This array will provide significant new capabilities for
              performing radioactive beam experiments; the development of such capabilities
              was identified as the highest priority new initiative in the 1995 Long Range
              Plan for Nuclear Physics.
