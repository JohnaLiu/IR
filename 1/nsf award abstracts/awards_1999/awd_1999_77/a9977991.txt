Description:  This award supports the US-India Cooperative
              Research: Studies of Mesoscale Weather Systems over the Indian Region Using
              Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) of Colorado State University (CSU).
               US PI William Cotton, Colorado State University will collaborate with Indian
              PI S.S. Singh, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).  Using RAMS for
              the Indian sub-continent, the researchers expect to identify-- predictability
              of mesoscale weather systems, entrainment in the boundary layer, and mechanisms
              controlling diurnal variations in precipitation during monsoon months. 
              

Scope:  Colorado State will host the Indian co-PI to acquaint that person
              with RAMS and the US PI will visit the IITM to present lectures on applications
              of RAMS.  Colorado State is the developer of the RAMS computer model and has
              the resources to perform complex simulations of weather systems.  The IITM
              scientists are very experienced with weather systems over the Indian
              sub-continent and have identified key unknowns in our understanding of those
              weather systems.  This collaboration is likely to make a major contribution to
              our understanding of weather systems in that region and identify how
              predictions can be improved upon.
