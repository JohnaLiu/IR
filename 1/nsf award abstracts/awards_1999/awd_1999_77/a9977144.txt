Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) and Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs, the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Akron will acquire an upgrade of an existing 300
              MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
              research in the following areas:  preparation and characterization of
              main-group and transition metal complexes with heterocyclynes; preparation,
              characterization and study of physical properties of dendrimer structures;
              conducting polymers; studies of enzyme mechanisms and protein modification;
              development of advanced multidimensional NMR for polymer characterization; and
              the study of three-dimensional structures of ordered polymers in
              solution.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
              to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
