              will acquire the components necessary to assemble and construct  a diode laser
              spectrometer based on newly developed inter-band and inter-subband quantum
              cascade diode laser technology .  The equipment will be integrated with
              existing laboratory equipment and facilities for research projects at the
              university. These mainly involve quantum-based investigations of intermolecular
              interactions and electron -molecule interactions.  The equipment will also be
              used in the interdisciplinary education of graduate, undergraduate and
              post-doctoral level students in fundamental measurement techniques of atomic
              and molecular properties.
