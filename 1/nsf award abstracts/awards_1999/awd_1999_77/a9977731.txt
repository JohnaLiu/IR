This  grant will support equipment to form an Integrated
              Wireless Research Laboratory at the Electrical Engineering Department, UCLA.
              The equipment will consists of instruments essential for the measurement and
              characterization of wireless systems and devices. Requested by eleven faculty
              and impacting more than 15 research programs and 300 graduate and undergraduate
              students, the equipment is selected such that it will boost both research and
              teaching capabilities of the department.  The instrumentation will play a
              central role in the following research projects: (1) antenna arrays  and smart
              antennas; (2) RF MEMS and sensor devices; (3) RF transceivers; (4) RF power
              electronics; (5) frequency synthesizers; (6) analog-to-digital and
              digital-to-analog converters; (7) modulation and digital baseband processor
              design. In addition, other related programs in the department and outside will
              benefit from these capabilities.  These wireless communication projects will
              also benefit from extensive involvement by roughly 30 industrial partners.
