Abstract    :
              This grant supports the development of an instrument to polarize ultra-cold
              neutrons (UCNs) and to control the direction of UCN polarization through an
              adiabatic fast passage (AFP) procedure.  The magnitude of the polarization
              produced, either parallel or antiparallel to the quantization axis, by this
              apparatus should be 0.999 percent or greater, representing roughly an order of
              magnitude improvement over neutron polarization schemes available at present. 
              Construction of this instrument constitutes the primary Princeton contribution
              in the development of a series of experiments probing the fundamental
              properties of the neutron and neutron beta-decay.  The first measurement in
              this series is a determination of the angular distribution of emitted electrons
              following the decay of polarized neutrons.  The difference between the emission
              rate parallel to the neutron spin and the rate anti-parallel to the neutron
              spin, the "beta-asymmetry," can be used to find the value of the axial
              form-factor for semi-leptonic weal interactions of the nucleon and also to
              determine one of the elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix.  The
              success of this experiment depends critically on the availability of an
              instrument to polarize and flip UCN spins.
