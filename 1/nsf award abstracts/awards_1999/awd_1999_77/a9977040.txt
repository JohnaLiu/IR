Abstract    :
              The investigator will examine the role of viruses in the biogeochemical cycling
              of iron (Fe) and carbon (C) in marine systems.  Viruses are a major cause of
              prokaryotic mortality, but in spite of many suggestions that they are important
              in nutrient recycling, only minimal quantitative evaluations of this process
              exist.  Preliminary data demonstrate that viruses can mediate rapid transfers
              of elements to bacteria and other plankton.  As prokaryotic organisms represent
              the majority of the living biomass in the ocean, viral lysis of autotrophic and
              heterotrophic prokaryotes represents a little studied source of potentially
              limiting nutrients to marine organisms.  Recent evidence also suggests that the
              bioavailability of Fe to marine organisms is regulated by the complexation of
              Fe by uncharacterized organic ligands in seawater.  This project will directly
              measure virus-mediated release of Fe and C from host cells using radioisotope
              and ultrafiltration techniques, and examine subsequent Fe bioavailability. 
              Field studies in the subtropical Atlantic Ocean and Strait of Georgia (British
              Columbia) will complement the lab studies by focussing on size-fractionated
              virus-host community dynamics and Fe/C transfer.
