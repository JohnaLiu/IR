Abstract    :
              This proposal outlines a program to develop a class of matrix-free algorithms
              for the solution of nonlinearly
constrained optimization problems. Of special
              interest are problems arising in modeling and simulation of
industrially
              important materials. Numerical algorithms will be developed, implemented and
              tested, and then
released as public domain software.  These matrix-free
              algorithms will, in turn,  be employed as 
educational tools. In particular,
              when teaching numerical methods (like Finite Element or Finite Difference
              Methods) in undergraduate classes, these methods will be used to shift the
              emphasis away from linear-algebraic issues (like building mass and stiffness
              matrices) allowing a stronger emphasis to be placed on methodology. The
              linear-algebraic details can then be left for more advanced classes.
