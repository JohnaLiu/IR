Abstract    :
              The  Show-Me Lectures  is a series of
meetings   in  mathematical
              analysis
organized by the following four institutions:
the University of
              Missouri-Columbia,
the University of Missouri-St. Louis,
the University of
              Missouri-Rolla,     and
Washington University in St. Louis.
Several lectures 
              have been delivered in previous 
Show-Me meetings  on many topics of Analysis,
               
such as analysis on groups, Banach space theory, 
differential equations,
              harmonic analysis,   
and probability theory. These lectures were  
presented
              by prominent mathematicians from all 
over the world. Attendance was not
              restricted to 
specialists from one field or another but was amimed at
              a
general audience  who wanted to learn more about 
another area and explore
              possible connections 
with theirs. Such connections have  certainly 
appeared
              in many instances and in several occasions 
have led to fruitful discussions
              and collaborations. 
Many quality collaborations have been accomplished 
as a
              result of these meetings and several more have
been initiated. It is our
              belief that these collaborations
benefit not only the researchers involved but
              also strengthen 
and unify the field of mathematical analysis as an entity.
              




Mathematical analysis can be viewed as the part of
mathematics whose
              primary roots lie in calculus.  
Its principal concepts are derivatives and
              integrals, 
which appear in a multitude of different settings.
Mathematical 
              analysis provides the foundation for applied mathematics, 
physics, astronomy
              and other areas, and is one of the more dynamic, 
viable, and  applicable 
              areas of mathematics today.
Among the many subspecialties of analysis of
              importance 
to science and pure mathematics, one may cite the theory
of
              integral transforms, which plays a major role in tomography, the theory of
              
wavelets, which in recent years has revolutionized the study of signal
              
processing, and the theory of Banach spaces, in which mathematicians
              have
constructed a richly endowed universe with infinitely many
              dimensions.
Recent Showme seminars have included principal lectures on each of
              these
subjects, and on numerous other topics in analysis, by
              distinguished
mathematicians, some from  various of our four universities in
              Missouri
and some from further afield. The primary objective of the Showme 
              meetings 
is to stimulate, promote, and enhance interaction 
between the
              different groups of mathematical analysis.
In addition to the stimulating
              lectures, these meetings 
are providing splendid opportunites for the analysts
              in Missouri and 
nearby states to learn about each other's work and to
              initiate
collaborations. We anticipate many more fruitful seminars in times
              to
come.
