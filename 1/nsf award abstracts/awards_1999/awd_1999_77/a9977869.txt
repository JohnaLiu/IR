Abstract    :
              
The disposal of excess spoil created by mining operations is usually
              accomplished by placing this material in valley fills, hundreds of which are
              now in existence.  The Federal Office of Surface Mining, as well as state
              regulatory authorities, regulate the stability of these structures.

This
              action concerns the stability of one of these excess spoil fills: It is being
              closely monitored due to concern that failure may occur as a result of spring
              rains.  This project includes the installation of a comprehensive deformation
              monitoring system on this fill, investigating water movement through the fill,
              testing soil samples from the site, and monitoring the ground water table in
              the vicinity of seeps and wet areas of the surface of the fill.

Data from
              this case study will advance understanding of the mechanism of slope failure,
              and the development of new design standards.  It has received strong support
              from government agencies and the local community.
