Abstract    :
              This proposal is aimed at implementing and testing a new technique for
              evaluating QoS in advanced digital networks in particular developing a software
              layer which provides qualitative measurements of transaction delay and delay
              constancy (jitter). The tools to be developed will be useful for managing
              connections in near real-time, media-rich, applications enabled by gigabit per
              second networking.
