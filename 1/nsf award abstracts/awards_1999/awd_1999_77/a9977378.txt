Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              and Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs, the Department of Chemistry
              at the University of Pittsburgh will acquire a 500 MHz Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) Spectrometer, a component of an In-Line Analytical and
              Automated Purification Instrumentation Facility.  This will allow the faculty
              to coordinate combinatorial synthesis and method development with the strict
              purification and routine high level NMR analysis that is important for quality
              control in organic chemistry.  Specific research topics include the preparation
              of smart materials from crystalline colloidal arrays polymerized in acrylamide
              hydrogels; development of new synthetic routes to natural products; mechanistic
              organic chemistry; discovery and optimization of biologically active small
              organic molecules; development and use of micro-reactors for solid phase
              organic synthesis; use of combinatorial synthesis strategies for development of
              polymetallic catalysts; development of artificial receptors for very selective
              extractions; new approaches to chemical product isolation and purification that
              exploit differences in solubilities between isomers; solid phase parallel
              synthesis of libraries of phosphatase inhibitors; fluorous phase parallel
              synthesis of libraries of phosphatase inhibitors; synthesis of libraries of
              alkene peptide isosteres; and synthesis and evaluation of new spacers for solid
              phase combinatorial chemistry.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
              frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
              such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
