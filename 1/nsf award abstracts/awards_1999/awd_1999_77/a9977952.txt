Abstract    :
              This research project proposes to study the use of groupware calendar systems
              within a number of organizations that have widely adopted them. Because local
              calendaring practices vary from site to site, the result is a variety of
              calendar cultures that afford different coordination behaviors within these
              organizations. In addition, the imminent availability of open standards created
              by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in support of calendar
              application interoperability means that calendars can more easily be shared
              across organizational boundaries (i.e., between businesses, public institutions
              and homes.) Thus, there are new opportunities for the use of shared groupware
              calendars across organizations (i.e., "global calendaring" practices). The PI
              will examine the IETF-Calsh standards design and their potential impacts on
              calendaring use and technology adoption across businesses as well as in home
              environments, with special attention to the practices and impacts of merging
              professional and personal calendars. This research will advance our
              understanding of collective time management practices within and across
              organizations, as well as between home and work.
