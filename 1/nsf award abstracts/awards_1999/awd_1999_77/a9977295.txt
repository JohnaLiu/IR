Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Case Western Reserve University
will purchase
              a multiple CPU server (2 SGI Origin 200 or equivalent),
largely dedicated to
              large parallel graphics computations, together 
with one graphics terminal
              (SGI 320 or equivalent) and printer (HP
LJ4500N or equivalent), will be
              dedicated to the support of research 
in the mathematical sciences. The
              equipment will be used for several
research projects, including in particular:
              (a) development and 
refinement of numerical methods for image identification
              and
restoration, (b) inverse problems in 3-d miscrocopy, (c) computation
and
              visualization of soliton geometry, (d) turbulence and passive
tracer
              transport, and (e) automatic differentiation with application
to chemical
              engineering.
