This
              award will support the construction of a state-of-the-art CCD camera to be
              mounted permanently at one of the Nasmyth foci of the Magellan 6.5 meter
              telescopes currently nearing completion in Chile. This instantly accessible
              camera will allow regular observations on a wide variety of timescales and
              permit rapid response to time-critical or transient phenomena such as gamma-ray
              bursts.  Other programs will include the monitoring of light from
              gravitationally lensed quasars, occultations of stars by solar system bodies,
              high precision photometry of microlensing events in the Magellanic Clouds,
              physical studies of near-earth asteroids, optical follow-up of supernovae in
              distant galaxies, and exploration of the Kuiper Belt.
