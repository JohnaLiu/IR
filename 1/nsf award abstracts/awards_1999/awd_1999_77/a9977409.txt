Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at
              Chapel
Hill will hire a systems administrator for the Applied Mathematics
              Program,
dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. 
              The 
systems administrator will facilitate research in several projects,
              including
in particular:  the numerical calculation of enhanced diffusivities
              in 
time-dependent, incompressible flows; the numerical assessment of
              weakly
compressible effects arising in anelastic fluid equations; numerical
              simulations
of flows of liquid crystalline polymers; internal waves in
              two-fluid systems; 
and adaptive methods for immersed boundary problems.  In
              addition to these
projects by investigators Camassa, Forest, McLaughlin, and
              Minion, the
systems administrator will also facilitate the computational
              scientific
research of new hires David Adalsteinsson and John Lowengrub.
