Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) and
              the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs will allow the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Chicago to acquire two mass spectrometers and an
              X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
              areas, including studies of large multi-charged metal complexes with an
              emphasis on bimetallic complexes and supramolecular assemblies and guest
              incorporation; synthesis of cubane analogs; studies of materials at high
              pressures; synthesis and study of very small, reactive hydrides of nitrogen;
              investigations of reductive elimination reactions in nickel(II) systems;
              chemistry of electrophilic metal complexes; molecular recognition; bioorganic
              chemistry and chemical biology; self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiolates on
              gold as model surfaces for understanding and controlling mammalian
              cell-substrate interactions; biological catalysis, for example, phosphoryl
              transfer reactions catalyzed by ribozymes; medium to large ring synthesis with
              carbene complexes; and the rational design, synthesis and characterization of
              novel functional and multifunctional polymers and molecules.  

Mass
              spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
              to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
              and organometallic molecules.  The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
              precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
              including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about
              the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. 
              This suite of instruments will facilitate research in biological chemistry,
              materials science, and general synthetic chemistry, as well as biological and
              geophysical sciences.
