Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) and
              the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs  will enable the Department
              of Chemistry at the University of Florida to acquire a Fourier Transform Ion
              Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer (FTICR-MS). This equipment will enhance
              research studies in the following areas:  1) protein and nucleic acid structure
              and biochemistry; 2)  in vitro selection with an expanded genetic alphabet; 3)
              enzyme-substrate complexes and isotope effects in trans-Sialidase; 4)
              expression of trans-sialidase; 5) synthesis of substrates and isotopomers; 6)
              novel neuropeptides and their function; and 7) three-fold symmetric
              supramolecular structures for selective recognition.

Mass spectrometry (MS)
              is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the
              molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and
              organometallic molecules.
