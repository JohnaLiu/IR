This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              Maryland at College Park provides a multi-collector inductively coupled
              plasma-mass spectrometer for geochemical  and  cosmochemical research.  It will
              be used for a wide variety of research projects involving elemental and
              isotopic composition, and will be integrated into a facility, the Isotope
              Geophysical Laboratory, which is heavily used by UMD and outside researchers. 
              The project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. University
              of Maryland will provide cost-share support for more than 40% of total project
              costs.
