This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              Maine provides geophysical instrumentation for study of sea level and related
              coastal research.  Consisting of a side-scan sonar system, seismic reflection
              profiler, digital data processing system and a vibracorer, it will be
              particularly used for research into evolution of coastal and nearshore systems
              and climate change in glaciomarine environments, especially the Gulf of Maine
              and adjacent environs.  Research plans by University of Maine faculty and
              students will focus on the acquisition of data needed to model processes of
              change near former ice sheet margins.  The facility plans to build on research
              partnerships developed over many years with state and federal agencies, private
              industry and other groups.  The project is supported by the Division of Ocean
              Sciences at NSF.  University of Maine will provide cost-share support for more
              than 40% of total project costs.
