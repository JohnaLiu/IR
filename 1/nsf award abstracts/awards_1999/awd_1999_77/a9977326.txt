This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI) Program, provides partial support for the costs of acquiring and
              commissioning a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) facility for
              geological, hydrological  and ecological research at the University of Alabama
              (UA) and nearby institutions.  This will be the first establishment a SIRMS
              facility within the state of Alabama and will benefit UA faculty from several
              departments as well as number of regional researchers including faculty from
              the University of Southern Mississippi, the University of Mississippi, Tulane
              University, Auburn University, Alabama A & M University, the Geological Survey
              of Alabama and The Alabama Department of Environmental Management.  A diverse
              array of research programs will utilize stable isotopes as tracers of
              biogeochemical processes in aquatic environments, as tracers of groundwater
              flow and provenance, to study the biogeochemistry of microbially produced
              carbonates, and in studies carbonate diagenetic history.
