              ABSTRACT

OCE-9977399

Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is
              distributed throughout the world ocean and may be a major determinant of the
              optical properties of oligotrophic ocean waters.  It may also play a major role
              in biogeochemically significant photochemical reactions that we are only
              beginning to recognize -- let alone understand.  In this study, three young
              scientists at the Bermuda Biological Laboratory for Research will test several
              hypotheses regarding microbially-mediated production of CDOM and its photolytic
              decomposition.   Four sets of experiments will be undertaken in Sargasso Sea
              environments near the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series site to determine (1) the
              microbial production of CDOM as a function of the quality of DOM, (2) the
              photophysical properties of CDOM as a function of origin, (3) alternate sources
              of CDOM (for example, zooplankton as opposed to phytoplankton and
              bacterioplankton),  and (4) changes in the bioavailability of CDOM to microbes
              after bleaching. The team expects to produce a quantitative description of the
              factors controlling CDOM distribution in the open ocean gyres far from
              land.
