Abstract    :
                           High Performance Symbolic Computation

The Department of
              Mathematics at the North Carolina State University will purchase 4 units of SUN
              HPC 450 (each having 4 processors) which will be dedicated to the support of
              research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
              research projects, including in particular:

  Helminck's project: Computer
              Algebra and Symmetric Varieties,
  Hong's project    : Solving Real Algebraic
              Constraints,
  Kaltofen's project: Computing with Black Box Objects and
 
              Singer's project  : Symbolic Computation and
                     
              Differential and Difference Equations.
