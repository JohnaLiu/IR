This grant, made through the Major Research
              Instrumentation (MRI) Program, provides partial support of the costs of
              acquiring a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy
              dispersive spectrometer (EDS) for major elemental compositional mapping and
              semi-quantitative spot analyses of geological and biological samples at
              Dickinson College, an undergraduate institution in Carlisle, PA.  In addition
              to its use as an educational tool involving undergrads in meaningful research
              projects, Dickinson faculty will make use of the EDS-SEM for studies of the
              petrogenesis of arc magmas, geochemical investigations of Quaternary tephras
              and Ordovician K-bentonites, and trace element investigations of bryozoan
              skeletons.
