Abstract    :
              More and more organizations are attempting to work long distance.  Since travel
              is time consuming, exhausting, and costly, they are turning to remote
              technologies, such as video and audio-conferencing.  High quality video, of
              course, is much more expensive than audio, and questions arise as to its
              efficacy and necessity.  This proposal asks two broad questions:

1. Under
              what conditions/tasks is the addition of video over audio truly beneficial?
2.
              What effect do various conditions of video degradation have on user
              performance?

The research focuses on the effect of the presence or absence
              of video on tasks deemed key to long-term teams, involving the establishment
              and maintenance of trust and the detection of deception.  In addition, we test
              how various reasonable degradations of the channels, those commonly used in
              making the cost of the connection cheaper, change people's behavior in these
              situations.  This work has both theoretical and practical import. 
              Theoretically, it reveals which cues people use when they engage in important
              social interactions that underlie task-related activities.  Practically, we
              will be able to provide advice for people who might find themselves in
              situations involving the building of trust or the detection of lying when that
              interaction is done remotely.
