              Abstract

	This project involves the acquisition and installation of
              instrumentation to  establish the Center for Genetic Diversity and Gene
              Expression Profiling at the Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell University. 
              Instrumentation to be acquired includes a robotics system for cDNA
              microarraying, and scanning microarrays, an ABI 377 thermal cycler to automate
              production of DNA templates for high throughput fluorescent sequencing and
              genotyping, and a Transgenomic WAVE DNA fragment analysis system for rapid
              separation and quantification of DNA fragments to identify SNPs.  The
              instrumentation will be placed in a shared user facilities to provide support
              for a large number of PIs involved in research aimed at understanding genetic
              diversity and genome-wide gene expression in plants.  These facilities will
              support the research projects of 9 major users and a number of minor users. 
              The instrumentation requested will support a common focus on understanding
              genetic diversity and genome-wide gene expression.  Instrumentation related to
              gene expression profiling will be housed at the Boyce Thompson Institute
              whereas equipment related to the detection of DNA sequence diversity will be
              housed in the Cornell Biotechnology building.  The research will be coordinated
              through the Directors of the Center to provide optimum support of the research
              and training activities of the users and maintenance of the instrumentation.
