Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
              Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University acquire XPS
              instrumentation for a departmental materials characterization facility. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
              (1) vapor deposition processes for synthesis and modification of electronic,
              novel polymeric, and nanostructured materials; (2) solid state and materials
              chemistry with an emphasis on zintl ion chemistry and heavy element
              environmental chemistry; (3) polymer and organic ultrathin films; (4) chemical
              vapor deposition of electronic materials; (5)  materials and surface chemistry
              as applied to organic semiconductor interfaces, preparation of organic light
              emitting diodes, and dye sensitization of wide gap inorganic semiconductors;
              and (6) thin film chemical vapor deposition.  

The X-ray photoelectron (XPS)
              spectrometer is used for chemical analysis. It irradiates a sample with a beam
              of monochromatic X-rays and the energies of the resulting photoelectrons are
              measured and are related to specific elements.
