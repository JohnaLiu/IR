MRI: 
              Acquisition of High Performance Clusters for Effective Parallel Computing in
              Computational Science Research and Education

The PIs request funding to
              purchase and operate a high speed network of computer systems that will
              complement state investment in computational science at  College of William and
              Mary and help drive significant, related research and educational activities. 
              The equipment will be used as the centerpiece of the common research focus: the
              effective use of parallel systems for scientific computation.  The PIs seek
              hardware that balances the many needs of their  activities.  The selected
              architecture consists of three interconnected subsystems each of which is a
              cluster of workstations or PC's.  Two of these are 16-processor  and
              32-procesor Pentium-based Beowulf-like systems built with different
              interconnection networks, and the third is a combination of four 4-processor
              SUN multiprocessors.
