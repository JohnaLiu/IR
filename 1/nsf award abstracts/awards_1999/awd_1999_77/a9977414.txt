This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of South
              Carolina at Columbia provides an isotope ratio mass spectrometer for global
              biogeochemical research.  It will be particularly used for research into
              compound-specific isotope geochemistry, a new field of particular importance in
              tracing pathways of chemical transfer and material partitioning in
              environmental systems.  Research plans by USC faculty include study of modern
              marine sediments and soils, past oceanographic and climatic conditions,
              dissolved organic material in natural waters, cycling of volatile gases and
              organic pollutants, and study of the geochemistry of the earth's interior. 
              Several research projects which will use the system are already underway at
              USC, but require that the analyses be carried out at other laboratories; this
              will be the first such instrument in the state of South Carolina with a
              capability for gas chromatography integrated with the mass spectrometer to
              allow the compound-specific analysis.  The facility will also be available to
              outside researchers on a cost-recovery basis.  The project is supported by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.  University of South Carolina will provide
              cost-share support for 30% of total project costs.
