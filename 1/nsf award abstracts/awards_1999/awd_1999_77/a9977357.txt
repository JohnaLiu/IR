This award to San Jose State University will provide support for
              installation of a local area network (LAN) in the new Moss Landing Marine
              Laboratories' (MLML) research facility in Moss Landing.  MLML has been housed
              in temporary facilities since the destructive Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989,
              which destroyed their laboratory facilities, and the new building is nearing
              completion.  It lacks a modern computing network, however, in part because
              funds for building replacement were very slow in coming, and are not intended
              for new capabilities; the modern LAN necessary for ocean sciences research and
              teaching did not exist a decade ago. The present award will provide 70% of the
              costs of acquisition of file server computers, peripherals, network
              installation, testing and certification, network hardware and support equipment
              for this research network, with non-federal cost-sharing by MLML providing the
              remaining 30% of costs.
