MRI: A PC-based Multithreading Environment for Solving Grand
              Computation Problems in Science and Engineering

The purpose of this proposal
              is to explore an alternative to the expensive parallel computing, called
              cluster computing.  The main idea is to develop and build a low-cost yet
              powerful parallel computer that consists of inexpensive dual-processor personal
              computers connected via commodity switchers and network cards.  To overcome the
              long communication latencies associated with general purpose switches, it is
              proposed to combine the multithreading and communication co-processor
              capability.  In this approach, each processor of a dual-processor PC has itself
              a dual role, acting both as a computation processor and a communication
              processor. Using software-enabled fine-grain multithreading, the duality of
              each processor allows the overlap of computation with communication, thus
              masking the long communication. The proposed architecture is designed to
              provide performance scalability and cost scalability. The principal result of
              the proposed research will be a cluster of PCs which can be used either as a
              powerful parallel computer to provide capabilities for computational science
              and engineering problems, or as a stable, scalable  Web server as would be
              suitable for electronic commerce, and which at the same time can be used as a
              desktop computer for daily computing needs.
