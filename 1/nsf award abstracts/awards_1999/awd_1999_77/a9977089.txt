Goerss
     Throughout different fields of mathematics, it is
              important to
understand how various objects acquire some sort of
              multiplication.
For example, in homotopy theory, which is the study of
              mathematical
phenomena that remain invariant under continuous deformation,
              one
wants to decide if an object has a multiplication that is commutative
up
              to all ``higher homotopies'' -- this is the type of multiplication
that is
              invariant under deformation.  One way to discuss this issue is
with the device
              of opera, which make rigorous the phrase ``higher
homotopies.''  Goerss
              intends to develop and explore these ideas in
the context of homotopy theory;
              for example, he would like to discuss
when a spectrum has an operad
              multiplication, and to discuss the
implications of the fact that the cochains
              on a topological space have
such multiplications.
     The broad goal of this
              project is to further understanding of
homotopy theory, the branch of topology
              concerned with properties of
higher-dimensional surfaces and other geometric
              objects that remain
invariant under continuous deformation.  There are some
              surprising
and rather mysterious connections between homotopy theory and
              seemingly
unrelated fields of mathematics such as number theory and
              algebraic
geometry, and one hopes the project will ultimately illuminate
              these.
