Epitaxial or textured large grain size diamond films
              with n-type dopant activity and semiconducting behavior have potential for high
              temperature, high speed, high dose and high power electronic devices. 
              Hitherto, attempts to deposit diamond films with n-type dopant activity that
              can generate high carrier concentration with high mobility have been
              unsuccessful.  The PI proposes to perform proof-of principle studies to
              overcome this limitation by the novel technique of neutron transmutation doping
              of double donors.  The proposed research consists of deposition of large grain
              size (100) oriented diamond films on silicon (100) wafer substrates.  A second
              layer of diamond will be deposited with isotope enriched 31Si and 10B dopants. 
              Neutron transmutation followed by annealing and passivation of radiation
              induced defects will be used to achieve n-type activity from 31P and 7Li
              dopants.  The ratio of n-type carrier concentration from 31P and 7Li to that of
              p-type from non-transformed 10B dopants will be enhanced by performing neutron
              transmutation at high neutron fluence.  Carrier mobility will be improved by
              annealing in nitrogen ion ambient for radiation induced defect reduction and
              passivation with nitrogen ions.
