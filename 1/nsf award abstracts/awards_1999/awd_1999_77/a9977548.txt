MIR: Acquisition of Instruments for Research in Computer Network
              Security

This proposal requests funding to acquire instruments to conduct
              experimental research in computer and network security.  In particular, funds
              will be used to develop the research infrastructure in terms of major pieces of
              equipment at the Center for Research in Information Systems Security.
              Currently, the members of this center are involved in active research in:
              unified frameworks for secure advanced transaction processing, using formal
              methods for verifying secure protocols, evaluation and vulnerability testing of
              commercial state-of-the-art secure protocols, and design and implementation of
              secure E-commerce protocols.  The grant will be used to acquire the hardware
              needed, advanced workstations and the network to connect them.  The instruments
              will be configured in the form of five clusters of workstations, and the
              clusters interconnected with each other via switches to form a wide area
              network in miniature.
