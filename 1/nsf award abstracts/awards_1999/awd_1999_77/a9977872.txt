Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs, the Department of
              Chemistry at California Institute of Technology will develop innovative
              programming techniques for using commodity multiprocessor computers on
              high-performance multiscale applications in chemistry, biology and materials.
              This equipment will enhance research in a variety of areas such as molecular
              dynamics simulations; materials problems requiring multi-physics solutions;
              multiscale materials applications; macrobiology applications; fluid dynamics
              and process simulation; and applications in protein design.

A workstation
              network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the
              computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network" also serves
              as a development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides
              state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research
              in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.
