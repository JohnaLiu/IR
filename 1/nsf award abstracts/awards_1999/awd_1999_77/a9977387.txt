MRI: Acquisition of Instrumentation for an Experimental Radio Facility
              in Support of Wireless Digital Communications Research

A team of researchers
              proposes to construct a facility to provide two-way digital communications
              capabilities which will consists of two base stations, a number of mobile units
              and all test equipment necessary to effect narrowband transmission over a
              geographical area of several square miles.  This facility will provide a
              resource that is rare in academia - an actual operational testbed for research
              into the algorithms and devices that make wireless digital communications
              possible.  Some of the issues that will be investigated with this facility
              include: (i) the effectiveness of various error control schemes in a wireless
              environment, (ii) the design and testing of novel communication devices,
              circuits and architectures based on compound semiconductor technology, (iii)
              the ''synergy'' arising from use of spatial diversity in conjunction with coded
              modulation and interference mitigation, and (iv) experimental testing of
              proposed new techniques for anticipating the ''deep fades'' that afflict mobile
              communications.
