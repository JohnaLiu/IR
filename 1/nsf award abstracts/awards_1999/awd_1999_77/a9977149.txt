Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology will
              use this award to help convert its library of Natural Sounds to digital storage
              on DVD discs, store them in a giant robotic jukebox, and provide direct
              internet access to the collection and its associated database. Archived sounds
              will be digitized at 96 kHz and 24 bits and stored in standard DVD format. This
              facilitates cloning, backup, and distribution in a form accessible by all
              users. Digital storage will result in a 5-fold increase in the rate of
              archiving new materials and a 70-fold improvement in the rate that remote users
              can retrieve archived sounds and data. 

Cornell University is a major center
              for bioacoustics training and research, and its Library of Natural Sounds hosts
              the world's largest collection of animal sounds.  This collection is already
              used for basic research, generation of acoustical censusing guides for
              conservation and management programs, K-12 and university courses, public
              information efforts, and media productions by public television and radio,
              National Geographic Society, and a variety of commercial firms.  Digitization
              of the collection will significantly enhance all current applications and
              enable several new approaches (e.g. broad comparative studies) that have been
              impossible given magnetic tape storage formats.
