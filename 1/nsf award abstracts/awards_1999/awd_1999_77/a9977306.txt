Abstract    :
              Subduction zones are the one place on Earth where materials from the surface
              (water, sediments and crustal rocks) can be carried into our planet's deep
              interior.  To quantify this process of subduction-zone recycling, we need to
              understand both the input of sediments and crust to trenches, and all
              geochemical outputs related to the subduction process.   While the chemical
              outputs  represented by magmatism at volcanic arcs and in back-arc settings
              have been widely studied, little is known about possible subduction-related
              outfluxes through the shallow forearc, between the arc and the trench.  We are
              attempting to characterize the "forearc flux" by examining serpentinites which
              are rising diapirically through the forearc mantle and crust in the Mariana
              arc-trench system.  Our work will complete efforts begun (with NSF support)
              several years ago, and will characterize these samples (and the slab-derived
              fluids which helped to create them) for radiogenic isotopes, lithium and oxygen
              isotopes, and the "fluid-mobile" elements Cs, Rb, U, As, Pb, and Sb.  Our work
              will allow us to characterize both the chemical inventories of species that are
              released from subducting slabs beneath forearcs, and the magnitude of this
              flux, for comparison with results for trench inputs (being collected as part of
              ODP Leg 125), and existing data for arc volcanic outputs in the Mariana system.
