MRI: 
              Acquisition of a Barrett Robot Hand System

To supplement the need for a
              sophisticated robotic test-bed used in ongoing and future research, this
              proposal requests funding for a Barrett Robot-Hand System.  This robot allows a
              researcher to directly access and modify the sinusolidally commutated current
              amplifiers; hence, its open control architecture facilitates the design and
              development of advanced low-level position/force controllers for multiple
              degree of freedom robotic systems.  More importantly, the multiple degrees of
              freedom and the end-effector mounted hand allow one to focus on specific
              dexterous manipulation problems.  In addition, the requested system with its
              advanced, high-speed cable transmission system (peak velocity of 6 m/s and peak
              acceleration of 6 g's at the end-effector) facilitates high-speed manipulation.
