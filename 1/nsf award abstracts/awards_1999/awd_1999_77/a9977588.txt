	This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of
              two mass spectrometers that will be installed and operated in the Department of
              Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology. MIT is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the
              acquisition. The instruments will be used by MIT faculty researchers and their
              students in high-precision geochronology to address the rates of change in
              biological and geological processes throughout the course of Earth history. The
              analytical capabilities of the new instruments will also be applied to
              developing the use of geochemical and isotopic tracers to understand ocean
              circulation and rates of change in ocean chemistry. Other uses will be made in
              the fields of paleontology, mantle geochemistry, crustal evolution, chemical
              oceanography, climate change studies, and environmental geochemistry.
