Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Harvard University will purchase computing
              equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects, including in particular:

Research on number theory and arithmetic
              geometry by Noam Elkies;

Research on algebraic geometry by Joseph
              Harris;

Research on the classification of geometric structures and dynamical
              systems by Curt McMullen.
