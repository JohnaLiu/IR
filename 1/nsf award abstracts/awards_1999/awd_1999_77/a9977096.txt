Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at the University of California at Los Angeles will
              purchase a computer server with four 450Mhz Zeon processors, 2GB RAM and 44 GB
              of disk space, as well as a number of 2$\times$ 450 Mhz Pentium II PCs with 128
              MB RAM, which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical
              sciences.  The equipment, which will be connected via clustering, will be used
              for several research projects, including in particular the following:
---
              ``Computation in Mathematical Finance'' by Jianqing Fan;
--- `` Monte Carlo
              and Optimization Methods in Statistical and
        Scientific Computations''
              by Wing Hung Wong
--- ``Parallelizing multivariate analysis programs'' by Jan
              de Leeuw

--- ``Dimension reduction for aggregated time-series data'' by
   
                  Ker-Chau Li
---  ``Computation in Point Process and Image Analysis'' by
              Frederic
