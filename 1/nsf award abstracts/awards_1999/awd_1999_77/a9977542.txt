Abstract    :
              This MRI award provides funds for the purchase of three instruments designed to
              strengthen the capabilities of the institution in the applications of an
              existing femtosecond pulse system to optical imaging and spectroscopy.  The
              instrumentation will directly impact the projects of graduate students and
              postdocs and offer opportunities for advanced-level training in ultrafast
              optics projects for undergraduates in an educational environment with a large
              population of underrepresented groups.
