The Principal Investigator will complete and prepare for
              publication two studies of the Variegated Glacier, a well-known surging glacier
              in Alaska with a large existing database. This is the first study of its most
              recent surge.  This surge occurred in 1995 and was observed by the Principal
              Investigator it the reconnaissance level.  He proposes to compare this surge
              with five or six other surges that have occurred in century. The second study
              is one of the relations of the surge period to mass balance and on the
              influence of weather on surge termination.
