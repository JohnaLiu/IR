Acquisition of
              High-resolution Multi-mode Digital Microscope System for Biological Research
              

This award will be used to purchase a research quality microscope with
              multiple optical modes.  This microscope will be used to obtain quantitative
              information from living cells stained with fluorescent probes.  An instrument
              with the capabilities of the multi-mode microscope system is not currently
              available to the faculty and students at Dartmouth College.  This system is
              particularly suited for tracking proteins fused to the green fluorescent
              protein (GFP) in living cells.  The specific projects for which the microscope
              will be used include the study of the dynamics of the cytoskeleton.  In
              particular, interphase and spindle microtubules and actin filaments labeled by
              conjugating X-rhodamine to tubulin or actin as well as the dynamics of
              membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (GFP-tagged ER proteins) and the cell
              cortex (detected by differential interference contrast; DIC) in living cells
              will be studied.  Overlay of GFP and DIC images of cells will be performed to
              determine the interactions between the cytoskeleton and membranes of the
              ER.

This microscope will be available to the faculty in the Department of
              Biological Sciences and the Molecular and Cell Biology Graduate Program.  In
              addition to research, the instrument will be used to train undergraduate and
              graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, including participants in
              Dartmouth's Women in Science Program and the Ernest Everett Just program for
              African-American students in the Sciences.
