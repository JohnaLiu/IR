This award will establish an Airborne Remote Sensing
              Facility for the University of Nebraska.  Funds are provided for the purchase
              of an aircraft that will be modified to carry recently acquired state-of-the
              art remote sensing instrumentation and related computing equipment.  The
              university will provide for the upkeep of the aircraft and has committed three
              years of funding to support three graduate students in each of those years who
              will be conducting research associated with this new facility.  The University
              of Nebraska has existing, well-respected research and education programs built
              around information from satellite remote sensing data that will be markedly
              enhanced by access to this new facility.  Airborne positioning of remote
              sensing equipment will allow calibrated and controlled remote sensing
              measurements not currently possible with ground-based systems.  Remote sensing
              information is relevant to many aspects of Nebraska's largely rural economy. 
              This facility will serve a broad diversity of researchers conducting research
              in such areas as Global Climate, Flood Mapping, Water Resource Monitoring,
              Vegetation Cover Inventories, Pollution Monitoring, and Land Use
