This award provides funding for the purchase of a Liquid
              Chromatographic Mass Spectrometer analytical system.  This equipment will
              become part of a core university facility accessible by faculty and student
              researchers at the University of Montana, Bozeman and at other neighboring
              institutions.  Funds are also provided for two years of salary for a technical
              support person to maintain the equipment, instruct researchers in its use, and
              assist in analysis and interpretation of data obtained.  Establishment of a
              core Mass Spectral Analytical Facility for Environmental Chemistry will be very
              important for the university in enhancing the research capabilities of existing
              faculty and students and recruiting high quality faculty and especially
              graduate students in the future.  The equipment will be important to the
              success of numerous research projects seeking answers to questions dealing with
              environmental quality.
