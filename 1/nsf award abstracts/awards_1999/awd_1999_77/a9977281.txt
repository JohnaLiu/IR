Abstract    :
              This major research infrastructure (MRI) award will provide measurement
              capabilities for dry deposition processes. The instrumentation will be deployed
              to quantify nitrogen deposition at an Ameriflux forest site in Indiana, where
              wet deposition measurements are also being carried out. The new instrumentation
              will provide continuous measurements of ammonia concentrations, and fluxes of
              oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and ozone. A relaxed eddy accumulation system for the
              measurement of ammonia fluxes will be developed.
