Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) and Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs, the Department of
              Chemistry at Princeton University will purchase a 64-Processor Origin 200
              Computer.  This equipment will enhance research in the following areas: 
              density functional theory (DFT) based ab initio molecular dynamics
              Car-Parinello simulations of materials; generalized coupled
              cluster/perturbation theory calculations of systems containing multiple
              transition metal atoms; study of adsorption and chemical reactions of atoms,
              molecules and clusters on surfaces using DFT calculations and molecular
              dynamics simulations; exact valence bond calculations of nonlinear optical
              properties and photophysics of conjugated polymers based on model Hamiltonians;
              periodic band structure DFT calculations of adsorption and reactions on iron
              surfaces; and band structure calculations of transition metal oxides.  

A
              workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to
              satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network"
              also serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and
              algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities,
              and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel
              processing.
