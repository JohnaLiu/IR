Abstract    :
              A multi-summer research experience for undergraduates with strong quantitative
              training and interest in the application of mathematics to the natural or
              social sciences is offered. First year students are introduced to dynamical
              systems theory, stochastic processes, modelling of biological populations, and
              methods of simulation during the first three weeks of the program.  The last
              four weeks of the program are devoted to the development of mathematical models
              that  address student-generated questions in the natural or social sciences.  
              Students, in groups of 2-5, carry out the mathematical analysis and simulation
              of their models and use their results to write a technical report (20-30 pages)
              that responds to their original question.  Four to eight students are selected
              as second year students.  They serve as mentors while participating in a
              simultaneous  8-week summer program that builds on their first year research
              experience.  Second year students also produce a significant technical group
              report (2-3 students) that addresses a scientific question.  The program
              recruits extensively from institutions that have access to limited research
              opportunities and
considers ethnicity and gender as part of the admission
              process. Students present their research at the end of the summer, at
              scientific conferences, and at the SACNAS national meeting.  The success of the
              program is measured by the quality of the research and by the number of
              non-traditional students who enroll in graduate school after their
              participation in our program. Students' progress is monitored  by the program's
              staff throughout the academic year.
