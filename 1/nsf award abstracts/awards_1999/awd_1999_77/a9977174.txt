Using funds from the Major Research Instrumentation program,
              the University of Alabama at Birmingham will acquire a nano-indentation and
              nano-imaging facility, consisting of a nano-hardness tester and an atomic force
              microscope.  This facility will be employed in the interdisciplinary research
              dealing with ultra hard thin film coatings for field emission display devices
              and tribological applications; indentation tests in composites, surface induced
              polymerization for nanocomposites and organic-inorganic nanoparticle composite
              films.  The training of graduate students in interdisciplinary joint projects
              among the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, and Materials and Mechanical
              Engineering within the university will be a strong focus of this facility.  In
              addition, during summer every year, this facility will be employed in the
              Research Experiences for Undergraduate projects. 

Nano-science is considered
              to be the next revolution in materials research with wide-ranging applications
              in physics, chemistry, and biosciences.  The instruments making up this
              facility, funded by the Major Research Instrumentation program, will enhance
              the research infrastructure at the university and provide an excellent learning
              experience for both graduate and undergraduate students.
