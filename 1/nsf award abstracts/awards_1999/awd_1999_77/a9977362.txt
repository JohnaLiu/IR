Abstract    :
              The researchers are developing an infrastructure that supports a) automatic
              generation of the functionality and architecture of a collaborative
              application, b) reuse of existing programs, and c) easy substitution
              of
infrastructure-provided components with custom ones. This research can have
              two kinds of impact. First, it can give application programmers a path for
              incrementally developing a collaborative application, enabling them to quickly
              discover tools that do not lend themselves to collaborative access and
              gradually fine-tune the functionality and architecture of those that do. 
              Second, it can allow developers of complete collaborative applications and
              infrastructures to become builders of individual components, sharing complex
              designs and implementations in diverse areas such as distributed systems,
              transactions, user-interfaces, and real-time communication.

The researchers
              are using existing collaboration systems to guide their investigation. In
              particular, they are re-implementing successful designs of collaboration
              systems using their infrastructure and existing single-user software. They are
              evaluating how well their infrastructure supports i) reuse by determining how
              many changes are required to existing software to make it work with
              infrastructure components, ii) composition by determining the extent to which
              components are shared among the collaborative systems
they implement, and iii)
              automation by determining how much effort is required in the implementation
              effort.
