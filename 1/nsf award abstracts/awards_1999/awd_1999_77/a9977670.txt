MRI: Acquisition of a
              Parallel Computer for Research and Research Training in Science at Washington
              University

This is a request to create a Center for Scientific Parallel
              Computing at Washington University, through the purchase of a 64 node Origin
              2000. Under the unifying theme of Scientific Parallel Computing, the computer
              will enable and enhance research in many individual disciplines (ranging from
              Biology to Physics, and from Mathematics to Earth and Planetary Science) as
              well as interdisciplinary research which spans these fields.  The Parallel
              Computing Center will significantly improve the quality and expand the scope of
              scientific research in two key ways: 1. For the large scale computational
              projects currently carried out using the National Supercomputing Centers, it
              will facilitate code development, preliminary runs for parameter searchers,
              data analysis and visualization.  2.  The center will support development and
              expansion of projects beyond the workstation scale which are presently below
              the National Supercomputing Center scale.  In summary, the existing
              computational research program will be enhanced and new projects will be
              fostered.
