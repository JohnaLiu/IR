CARMA: A Proposal for Development Funds

The
              proposal is for funding to begin implementing long-lead items required for
              merging the Owens Valley Millimeter Array and the BIMA Array to produce a new
              array called CARMA (Combined Array for Millimeter-wave Astronomy).  The new
              array will be sited in the Inyo Mountains of central-eastern California, near
              the present Owens Valley site but higher in elevation.    Improved atmospheric
              conditions at the new site will allow routine observations in the prime 1.3mm
              band.  

The proposal requests $350,000 to continue development of CARMA by
              hiring a Project Manager and contracting consultants to conduct a study of and
              design a road to the new CARMA site.  These are necessary if a solution is to
              be found  for the problem of site approval by the Forest Service.  There is
              considerable resistance from environmental groups for use of the preferred
              site, Upper Harkless Flat, which is about 40 minutes drive from the current
              OVRO site.  A more distant site, Badger Flat, is also being considered and may
              be less controversial.  The new Project Manager will be tasked with shepherding
              the project through the process of obtaining the necessary permits for the new
              site, whichever one it turns out to be.  He or she will also oversee
              development of the site and eventually supervise transport of the Caltech and
              BIMA telescopes from their current locations and their integration into a
              working interferometer.
