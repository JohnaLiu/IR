              Abstract

This award will support the purchase of large format, science-grade
              infrared detector arrays for a new wide-field infrared camera being built as a
              dedicated faciltity instrument for the Dupont 2.5 meter telescope at the Las
              Campanas Observatory in Chile.  The wide-field infrared camera represents a
              significant upgrade to the observing capabilities of the Dupont telescope, and
              is expected to dramatically enhance a broad range of galactic and
              extra-galactic research programs now underway at the Carnegie Institution.  In
              particular, wide-field, near-infrared surveys that reach objects as faint as
              magnitude 22 in K are a necessary first step to providing a clearer picture of
              galaxy evolution out to redshifts of 2 and beyond.
