This grant will add a fundamental new thin film processing
              capability, namely chemical-mechanical polishing, or CMP, to the existing thin
              film device fabrication capability within the clean-room of Carnegie Mellon
              University.  Specifically it will add a Strasbaugh 6EC laboratory planarization
              tool, a turnkey CMP system, and industry standard.

Within the Carnegie
              Mellon clean-room, this process capability will be applied to the making of
              magnetic thin film devices, specifically recording heads.  The CMP process will
              also be applied to the integration of magnetic thin film devices with the CMOS
              MEMS (Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems)
              device process that has been developed at CMU. The integration of the CMOS MEMS
              technology with magnetic devices is seen as an important step in the
              development of highly integrated computing systems that integrate massive
              amounts of nonvolatile storage with high speed computation capability. The CMOS
              MEMS process developed at CMU allows mechanical and magnetic devices to be
              closely integrated with active circuits, which are contained in the underlying
              layers. Constructing fine magnetic and mechanical geometries on top of a
              complete CMOS wafer requires that the topography of the CMOS layers be
              planadze& This allows the required depth of focus of the lithographic tool, and
              the thickness of the photoresist layers used to pattern the magnetic and
              mechanical devices to be minimized.
