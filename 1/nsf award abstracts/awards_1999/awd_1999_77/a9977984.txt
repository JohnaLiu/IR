Abstract    :
              The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) serves
              the needs of social and behavioral science faculty and students through a
              variety of means, chief among them today an extremely large and active site on
              the World Wide Web.  This project will enhance user support on the ICPSR Web
              site in four main ways, employing the best Web software available and newly
              emerging international standards for best practice in documentation for social
              science data.  The ICPSR end-user support network also will be
              strengthened.

The project will: (1) improve the tools on the Web site for
              the discovery of data;  (2) substantially extend an existing database of
              bibliographic references to publications; (3) train an existing network of
              end-user campus support representatives to assist with hard-to-use data sets;
              and (4) integrate major data resources outside of ICPSR fully into the
              searchable ICPSR metadata databases.  The result of these four tasks, plus
              other work done by ICPSR with internal funding, will be substantially improved
              user support services on what is already one of the most useful and most-used
              Web sites in the social and behavioral sciences.
