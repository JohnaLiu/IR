Abstract    :
              
This MRI award will strengthen the computing and network infrastructure of the
              Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) by the acquisition of  modern
              Intel Linux desktop workstations, the replacement of a hub-based network
              infrastructure with switching hardware, and the upgrading of network cabling.  
              

MSRI exists to further mathematical research through broadly based programs
              in the mathematical sciences and closely related activities. Each year the
              Institute hosts 2-4 major research programs, covering a wide variety of topics
              in pure and applied mathematics.

During the year 1999-2000, MSRI will host
              three programs on Noncommutative Algebra, Galois Groups and Fundamental Groups,
              and Numerical and Applied Mathematics. Each of the major programs organizes an
              introductory workshop and one or more specialized workshops. 

The
              computational equipment will be used for research in these areas. The network
              equipment to be acquired through this proposal is fundamental to obtaining
              access to the Global Information Infrastructure for formal and informal
              scholarly communication, the transport of scientific data and the discovery and
              use of networked literature.
