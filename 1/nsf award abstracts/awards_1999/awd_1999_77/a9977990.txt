Abstract    :
              The questions to be asked center on the molecular evolutionary mechanisms that
              create initial gene structures and control subsequent evolution.  The
              objectives of this research are: (1) to understand molecular evolutionary
              relationships among the new genes in the jgw (jinwei)-ynd(yande) gene system by
              characterizing their gene structures and flanking sequences in D. teisseiri, D,
              yakuba, and D melanogaster, using various methods of molecular analysis (2) to
              determine when the two mosiac genes, ynd and ymp(yellow- emperor) originated,by
              determining their phylogenetic distribution using molecular phylogenetic
              techniques  (3) to determine the roles of various evolutionary forces governing
              the early stages of new genes, by analyzing molecular evolution and population
              genetics of jgw, ynd, and ymp (4) in order to look for the correspondence
              between the newly evolved function and the fast sequence evolution of jgw as
              revealed by previous analysis of molecular population genetics, the biochemical
              functions of the jgw proteins at three stages: the ancestral jgw when first
              created, the evolved ancestral jgw before speciation, and the modern jgw genes
              will be investigated.  The two ancestral jgw sequences are inferred by
              evolutionary analysis and they will be made by site-direced mutagenesis. 
              

The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate how new genes with
              novel functions originate, a fundamentally important problem of gene evolution.
               Studying the origin of a gene in detail requires the discovery of a young
              gene, since the early evolution of old genes has often been obscured by later
              evolutionary processes.  The recently identified jingwei-yande gene system in
              Drosophila contains several genes only 2.5 to 30 million years old jingwei
              (jgw) originated as an Adh retrosequence that recruited several additional
              exons, while yande (ynd) evolved through exon recombination with yellow-emperor
              (ymp).  Therefore, these young genes, with other related genes in the gene
              system that evolved recently in gene structure and copy number, provide an
              excellent opportunity to examine early processes in the origin of new genes.
