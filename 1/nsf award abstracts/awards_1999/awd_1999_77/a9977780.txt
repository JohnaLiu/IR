This award provides support to establish The Agent
              Institute (AI), an organization anticipated to become self-sustaining and
              generally enhance research and development for the State of Maine.  The AI will
              promote interactions between industry and foster computer-technology research,
              specifically in software development and software-hardware relationships in the
              area of robotics.  Industrial applications in extreme or hazardous environments
              will be emphasized because agent-based systems are designed to read/sense
              environmental information, make decisions, and take actions based on the
              information sensed and processed.  

The award provides an initial two years
              of salary support to hire an executive director and an administrative
              assistant.  These individuals will be responsible for developing a series of
              workshops designed to bring researchers and developers with interests and
              expertise in agent-based systems together in collaborative projects. Education
              and outreach efforts will also be part of the AI's mission to bring knowledge
              about this area to K-12 educators and schools with the goal of encouraging
              students toward careers in agent-based systems and high technology in general.
