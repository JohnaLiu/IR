Minimally Supervised Acquisition of 3D Recognition Models from Large
              Visual Corpora

This is the first year award of a three-year continuing
              grant. This research concerns with training 3D object recognition systems from
              imagery, which will allow the recognition of objects without constructing a 3D
              geometric model, and the recognition of objects where current geometric
              recognition technology does not apply. In various forms, image-based methods
              are currently the most successful general approach. Two issues that have been
              little explored are: (1) whether such systems can be trained from imagery that
              is unlabeled, and (2) whether they can be trained from imagery that is not
              trivially segmentable. These questions are the focus of this research proposal.
              Using a 3D recognition system the PI has developed, and possibly others, the
              project will investigate training, updating, and refining 3D representations
              for recognition from unstructured or semi-structured imagery and demonstrate
              the technology through working prototypes.
Issues connected with training
              include basic algorithm design, controlling growth of the representation
              dealing with clutter, and correcting mistakes. Issues associated with the
              training corpus include quantifying the required density of salient images,
              allowable clutter, and required seed information. Issues connected to the
              recognition system include handling clutter, space requirements, and new
              capabilities such as dealing with hierarchical representations or flexible
              objects. Formal models for the various stages of the process will be
              developed.
