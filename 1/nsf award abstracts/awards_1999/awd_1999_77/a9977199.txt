Abstract    :
                   This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funds to create a
              three-dimensional, full-immersion, synthetic environment, which will be known
              as the C6.  This facility will include a room where all four walls, the floor
              and the ceiling are projection screens that are capable of displaying
              back-projected stereoscopic images, thus providing total immersion of the
              participants.  A position tracking system will facilitate tracking of various
              users inside the space, providing the ability for three-dimensional
              interactions between the users and their simulations.  Audio feedback and
              haptic display will further enhance the immersive experience.
     The C6 will
              be the only facility of its kind in the United States, one of three in the
              world.  It will enable researchers to gain new understandings of fundamental
              phenomena with applications in virtual prototyping, product development,
              human-enhanced dynamic data exploration, immersive architectural modeling, and
              a wide variety of human-in-the-loop applications.  The C6 will also be part of
              a test bed for cross-disciplinary collaboration across geographically separated
              virtual worlds, a new field that promises to revolutionize the way engineers
              and scientists cooperate.
