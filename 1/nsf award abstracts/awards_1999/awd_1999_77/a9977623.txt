Abstract

	This project involves the acquisition and use of two
              mass spectrometers for biological research.  These systems will be placed in
              the Mass Spectrometry Core Facility in the Beckman Research Institutes at the
              City of Hope Cancer Center.  This equipment will support the research
              activities of twelve on site users as well as the forty-eight grant supported
              users from outside the City of Hope.  Research that will benefit from these
              instruments includes oligonucleotide sequencing and complex protein analysis;
              subpicomole protein sequencing; analysis of antibody conjugates;  better
              identification of components in complex mixtures; identification of peptide
              cleavage products from crude mixtures derived from cleavage of internal peptide
              bonds; identification of the products of oxidative damage to nucleic acids. 
              Confirmation of sequences and modified bases by mass spectrometry will be used
              for quality control of synthetic DNA and RNA from the synthesis facility.  The
              instrument will provide substantive support for the entire molecular biology
              effort at the City of Hope.
