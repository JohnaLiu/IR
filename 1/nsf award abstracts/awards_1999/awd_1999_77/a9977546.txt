Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) and Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs, the Department of
              Chemistry at the College of Wooster will acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer.
              This equipment will enhance research on 1) studies of complexes of peptides and
              phosphate compounds, which serve as models for Ca(II)-mediated protein-membrane
              interactions; 2) aziridinium carbonylation reactions for synthesis of
              beta-amino acid analogs; 3) mutants of rabbit muscle creatine kinase; and 4)
              three-dimensional structure determination of a heat shock protein.

Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
              who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
              useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
