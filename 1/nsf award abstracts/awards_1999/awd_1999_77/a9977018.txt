This grant will support a graduate student working on an
              ongoing project in phonetic research. The work will interpret dialogue speech
              data obtained by the PI's research associate, Dr. Donna Erickson, supported by
              a NSF grant (SBR-951198) with the current PI. The data analysis primarily
              pertains to jaw movement to evaluate syllable strengths in various prosodic
              conditions, with use of other articulators' movement patterns for determining a
              "central" time for each syllable. The segmental content of the syllables under
              study is limited to the words 'five', 'nine' and 'pine' in a street address
              correction situation of conversation. The data interpretation inferring
              syllable magnitudes for various degrees of prominence is in part based on the
              PI's C/D model, a syllable-based description of articulatory gesture
              organization. In particular, magnitudes of boundaries in the syllable-boundary
              pulse train, representing the prosodic organization of each utterance, are
              evaluated by first evaluating syllable durations based on jaw movement
              excursions. Simultaneously recorded acoustic signals are consulted for
              validating the quantitative interpretation of syllable-boundary durations
              purely from articulatory data.
