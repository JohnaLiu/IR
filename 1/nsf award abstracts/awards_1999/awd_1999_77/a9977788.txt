This award provides funding to establish a Virtual Center for
              Plant Genomics which will be a research and graduate education/research
              training facility distributed between Montana State University (MSU) and North
              Dakota State University (NDSU).  This highly innovative project will revise the
              current course offerings of both institutions in plant molecular genetics and
              replace them with an on-line course and laboratory curriculum made possible via
              Internet II connectivity.  This distance learning experiment also plans to
              involve nationally recognized researchers in plant genetics at other
              institutions and make them accessible to students at MSU and NDSU both through
              "guest lecture" modules incorporated into the courses and as remote mentors for
              graduate student questions and research problems by way of an on-line chat
              room.  Funds are provided for high throughput DNA sequencing equipment and
              other instrumentation to set up identical suites of state-of-the-art equipment
              for molecular research and for technical support positions to design and
              maintain the on-line course and dialogue materials.

This facility will
              strongly enhance the graduate programs of both institutions and is expected to
              foster positive relationships with biotechnology industries, potentially
              leading to a system of student internships.
