During the
              Classic Thule period (ca. AD 900-1200) the people of the Eastern Arctic appear
              to have subsisted on bowhead whales.  Residences consisted of semi-subterranean
              dwellings, with stone foundations, walled and roofed with whale bone, skins,
              and sod.  Such sites are frequently located on low ridges with expansive views
              of bowhead sea lanes, surrounded by numerous food caches and extensive midden. 
              Some researchers argue that with the onset of neo-boreal cooling, conditions
              worsened for whaling.  A shorter ice-free season and less open water reduced
              the profitability of taking whales, while economic return rates from
              breathing-hole sealing improved.  As a consequence, diets shifted from an
              emphasis on bowheads to reliance on ringed seal, and the Eastern Arctic entered
              the Modified Thule Period, the precursor to historic Inuit economies. This
              study uses stable isotopes to follow up on an earlier pilot study and test the
              hypothesis that an economic transition took place at the end of the Classic
              Thule period, from heavy dependence on bowhead whaling to reliance on the
              ringed seal.  Results will fill significant gaps in the research on the
              peopling of the Eastern Arctic.
