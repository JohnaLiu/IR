MRI: Acquisition of Virtual Reality and Visualization Facilities for
              Advanced Scientific and Engineering Computation

This request pertains to
              developing university-wide visualization and virtual reality facilities.  The
              proposed equipment consists of a cluster of virtual reality and visualization
              equipment co-located within several research groups, and networked together.
              These clusters of hardware will include Immersadesks, workstations, recording
              equipment, and a large array of RAID disk drives.  This equipment will be
              integrated through a common hardware platform, consistent software support,
              software co-development, and high-speed ATM networks.  The proposal includes
              undergraduate and graduate education directed at engaging students in on-going
              campus research involving advanced visualization.
