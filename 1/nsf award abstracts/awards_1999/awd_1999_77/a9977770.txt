This proposal requests funding to support the development of
              high-speed data acquisition instrumentation for highly segmented particle
              detectors used in high energy physics experiments.  This instrumentation with
              comprise a next-generation data acquisition system consisting of
              high-performance hardware and software to read data from, and to provide
              control of, large numbers of high-granularity detector elements.  The data
              acquisition system will be applicable to a wide range of high energy physics
              experiments. Specifically, it may be used for the ATLAS experiment currently
              being built for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in
              Geneva, Switzerland.
Application to the ATLAS Semiconductor Tracker (SCT)
              would enable particle physics research at the highest accessible mass scales,
              offering the opportunity to search for the mechanism of electroweak symmetry
              breaking and other new phenomena at the high energy frontier.  It will also
              provide training in the techniques of high energy physics research,
              specifically in the areas of high-speed electronics, real-time computing, data
              acquisition systems, and semiconductor detectors.  The instrumentation
              development will provide research training for personnel at all levels:
              faculty, research staff, postdoctoral fellows, and both graduate and
              undergraduate students.
