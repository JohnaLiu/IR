Abstract

	This project involves the acquisition, installation and
              use of a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipment for
              interdisciplinary research at Tulane and Xavier Universities organized under
              the Center for Bioenvironmental Research.  The HPLC will provide additional
              quantitative analytical capacity at the Center for research on endocrine
              disruption in health, disease and nutrition and nephrology due to
              environmentally active chemicals and their metabolites.  Specific studies will
              include analysis of production and synthesis of phytochemicals in soy and soy
              foods; estrogenic and antiestroegenic activity of flavonoids in normal and
              neoplastic human breast epithelial cells; metabolic activation of environmental
              hormones, mechanisms of endocrine disruption through molecular interactions
              with the human estrogen receptor and activation of estrogenic signaling;
              examination of the soy flavonoid genistein on reproductive health and hormonal
              status of pregnant primates and subsequent developmental effects on exposed
              offspring; short and long term evaluation of health benefits of soy rich diets
              in Type II diabetics.  The HPLC will also have an impact on the research
              opportunities on the undergraduate/graduate fasttrack program for
              identification and support of promising future minority scientists.
