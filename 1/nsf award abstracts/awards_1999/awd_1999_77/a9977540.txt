MRI: Acquisition of a High-Performance Parallel
              Computer to Support an Interdisciplinary Computational Science Center for
              Physical Science, Mathematics and Engineering

This is a proposal to
              construct a high-performance computing platform to enhance the state of
              scientific computing at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.  The computing
              platform will consist of 48 Pentium II processors.  The purpose of this
              parallel computing platform is to: (i) facilitate the research of faculty
              members whose work involves computational simulation or massive data
              processing,  (ii) encourage collaboration among faculty located in diverse
              departments and schools, (iii) provide a medium where new compiler technology
              and parallel processing research in the Computer Science Department can be
              tested and incorporated into state-of-the-art scientific applications, (iv)
              provide a testbed for new parallel algorithms and approaches and (v) allow
              graduate students quick access to parallel processing capabilities for use in
              classes or directly in research.
