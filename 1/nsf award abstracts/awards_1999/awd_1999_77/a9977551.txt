Abstract    :
                             Funds are requested to purchase a high-resolution x-ray
              microtomography system for biomedical and biomaterials research. The PIs claim
              that this equipment would be the only such system in the Southeast and would be
              expected to stimulate numerous collaborations in the region. Within several
              years, the instrumentation would be expected to impact the training of 10
              postdoctoral fellows, 50 graduate students, and 150 undergraduates.
	Some of
              the research areas that would markedly benefit from the new equipment include
              studies of fatigue crack repair, damage in metal and polymeric composites, bone
              structure and damage studies, and modeling of arteries and arterial plaque.
