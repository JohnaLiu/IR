Abstract    :
              This project provides support for acquisition of high-end parallel processing
              computer for the college of Engineering at Drexel University.

This parallel
              computing platform will support cross-disciplinary research needs in performing
              challenging numerical computations on single workstations or overloaded network
              servers.  

The parallel computing server will provide a shared memory
              computing environment with low-latency, high bandwidth communication between
              processors.  It has many advantages including: a stable technology, minimum
              required support personnel, scalability, an extensive development environment,
              software tools for converting programs to parallel, and low cost relative to
              massivey parallel systems.  It would enable quick startup of the parallel
              machine and rapid transition of current computational models to the parallel
              platform.

The high-performance parallel server will benefit research
              programs in computational fluid dynamics, computational mechanics, materials
              processing, microstructure development, dynamic optimization, widespread
              fatigue damage, communications, trafficking, computer architecture modeling,
              and population dynamics.  Researchers can solve larger problems and can solve
              computationally intensive problems more rapidly.

This is an equipment grant
              supported under MRI program.
