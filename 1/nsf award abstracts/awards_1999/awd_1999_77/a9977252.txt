Abstract    :
              Trace constituents preserved in ice cores from the Greenland ice cap Summit have
              been used as markers of climate change.  This research would develop a more
              precise method, using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, to measure
              concentrations of salts and metals in both snow and short ice cores from
              Summit.  A new ice-core sampling and injection system attached to the mass
              spectrometer would allow determination of these chemical species in thinner
              strata of ice representing less than 10 years of ice deposition, a much finer
              time resolution than possible with past methods.  These results will be
              examined to see if the ice cores fully preserve the same constituents as found
              in fresh snow.  From the ice-core data, climatic shifts over the last 300 years
              will be evaluated.
