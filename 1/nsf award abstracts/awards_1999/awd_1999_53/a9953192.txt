Abstract    :
              This project develops a curriculum and supporting infrastructure to recruit,
              train and retain a cadre of skilled, versatile, technology-adept,
              standards-oriented teachers certified to teach Earth Science and other science
              topics. It includes adapting curricular materials and software tools developed
              at a national laboratory to create an exemplary earth science course at the
              lower lever for all prospective teachers. The focus on the Earth is motivated
              by an acute teacher shortage in this area and knowledge of the importance of
              educating the citizenry about this suite of topics. The activities include
              recruiting students while they are still in high school or community college
              through existing outreach and enrichment programs; educating them through a
              model curriculum built around our pooled understanding of Earth processes and
              learning processes; and nurturing them with teacher-mentors and teaching and
              research opportunities from high school through the first year of teaching. The
              students served are predominantly first-generation college educated, and a
              large fraction are from minorities under-represented in science. This proposal
              represents a collaboration between a college which is a regional center of
              excellence in science education and teacher preparation, a distinguished
              scientific research laboratory, and an open-admission two year community
              college serving an economically and ethnically diverse population.
