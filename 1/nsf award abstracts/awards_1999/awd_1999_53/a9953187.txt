Abstract    :
              
UTeach is a collaboration between the Colleges of Natural Sciences and
              Education at The University of Texas at Austin, in conjunction with the Austin
              Independent School District, to improve the preparation of secondary science
              and mathematics teachers. Anticipating a projected steady state of 500
              students, it is becoming one of the largest programs for secondary science and
              mathematics teacher preparation housed in a research university. The UTeach
              program includes extensive recruitment among students in the Colleges of
              Natural Sciences and Engineering and at Austin Community College, financial
              support for students, and revised pedagogy and content courses for prospective
              teachers. Project goals include: 1) expansion of guided early field experiences
              supervised by master teachers; 2) development of exemplary undergraduate
              courses that model Standards-based instruction and reform of large service
              courses in science and mathematics that pose particular barriers to students
              with weak backgrounds; 3) increased use of modern information and
              communications technologies in both education and subject-matter courses; and
              4) attention to issues of equity, including student recruitment and support, as
              well as program content. While the design of the program addresses the
              immediate needs of the state of Texas, the project is producing a set of
              teacher education programs and products that can be used and replicated
              nationally.
