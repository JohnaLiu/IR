CISE/POWRE: 
              Network Design and Resource Management for Survivable Wireless Access

This
              research addresses survivable network design and analysis and restoration
              techniques for wireless access networks.  The project has two main thrusts. 
              First is survivable network design and analysis. Scaleable cell-site topologies
              and adaptive resource management algorithms which incorporate survivability are
              developed. Both initial topology design and the problem of modifying an
              existing topology to improve the survivability  are addressed. In addition,
              techniques for analyzing the survivability of wireless access networks are
              being developed. Secondly, intelligent restoration algorithms are developed.
              The aim is to develop algorithms for automatic invocation by  network
              components, resulting in a self-healing network. Due to the complexities
              involved the approach used combines optimization theory, heuristics and
              simulation.  Simulation incorporates the use of empirical data.
