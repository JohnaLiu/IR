Abstract    :
              
Recent studies have shown that many fish are similarly maneuverable, but
              differ in their abilities to stabilize themselves in the turbulent environments
              typical of the natural world.  Differences in stabilizing/maneuvering
              mechanisms affect behavior, habitat choices and fish distributions.  The
              proposed research by Dr. Webb will contribute to basic knowledge by measuring
              the abilities of four species of fishes differing in body and control-surface
              form to stabilize the body and swimming trajectories when they are perturbed by
              outside hydrodynamic disturbances.  Furthermore, the locomotor prowess of
              fishes cannot be matched in any given human-fabricated underwater vehicles. 
              Therefore, the proposed research will contribute to applied knowledge by
              providing sources for novel designs for submersibles that must increasingly
              operate in shore and near shore situations.  Data will be obtained using
              high-speed video as fish stabilize themselves in response to disturbances
              during median and paired fin (MPF) hovering and swimming, and during
              body-caudal fin (BCF) swimming.  The flexibility and integrity of stability
              mechanisms will be modified in these situations to determine the importance of
              control-system design.  These species span major morphological systems used in
              stability control.  The project is explicitly designed to have a major role in
              undergraduate education, as well as graduate training.
