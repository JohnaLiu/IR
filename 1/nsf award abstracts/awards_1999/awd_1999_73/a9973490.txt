Abstract    :
              This proposal was submitted to the NSF-wide Professional Opportunities for Women
              in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The PI proposes to integrate
              satellite images of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a with in
              situ data for northeastern coastal waters. The PI will use data from two
              satellite instruments, an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and
              the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS).  By comparing two satellite images that
              have the same resolution, the processes controlling productivity can be better
              understood.  The remotely sensed data will be supplemented with in situ
              meteorological data collected from NOAA buoys, data from tide gauges and
              chlorophyll-a data collected from ships of opportunity. In particular, the PI
              will attempt to understand the relationship between temperature fronts and
              productivity in the northeastern coastal waters.
