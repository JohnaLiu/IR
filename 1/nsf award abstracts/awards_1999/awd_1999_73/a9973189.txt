This project is a continutation of an NSF project that
              began in 1997, which aims to study the tectonices of a seismically active area
              in the interior of Alaska.  The principal goal of the present project is to
              determine the slip rate of the Denali fault using two fault-crossing GPS
              profiles.  A dense profile situated near Denali National Park was established
              in 1997, while a sparser profile about 200km to the eat was established in
              1998.  The invesitgators will use the data from the two profiles to estimate
              the fault slip rate, which will be combined with data from sites in the
              deforming region north of the fault to develop a quantitative tectonic model
              for the region.
