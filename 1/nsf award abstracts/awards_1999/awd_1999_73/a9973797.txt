CISE/POWRE:  Functional and
              Physical Co-Analysis in Timing Verification

This is exploratory work in
              innovative timing analysis that considers the interaction among the physical,
              functional, and timing aspects of a circuit.  The proposed approach is based on
              developing a novel gate  delay model, the dynamically bound delay model, that
              can accurately capture delay variations due to physical, functional, and timing
              interactions.  The PI will also investigate timing  analysis algorithms that
              complement the model. The novel delay model and comparable algorithms will
              allow analyzing and verifying the temporal behavior of large sequential
              circuits while co-analyzing the layout and functional effects.  The research
              will be utilized to advance the PI's academic and research career.
