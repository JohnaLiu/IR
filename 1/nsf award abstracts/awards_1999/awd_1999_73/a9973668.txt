Abstract    :
              The research involves electrochemically promoted catalytic asymmetric
              hydrogenation using chiral palladium complexes (L-L)PdCl2, where L-L is a
              chiral, bidentate, iminium ligand.   Electrochemical reduction of the Pd(II)
              with loss of chloride ion gives a coordinatively unsaturated (L-L)Pd complex,
              which is part of a catalytic cycle involving coordination of an unsaturated
              prochiral substrate E=CR'R",and  reduction with 2e- and 2H+ to give HEC*HR'R",
              regenerating (L-L)Pd.   The product may be an alkane or amine, depending on
              whether E is CH2 or NH, and will be analyzed by GC/MS, chiral GC and/or LC, and
              NMR with chiral shift reagents.   Once effective homogeneous catalysts and
              reaction conditions have been found, heterogeneous hydrogenations, with the
              catalyst tethered to the electrode, will be explored.

With this POWRE award
              the Chemistry Division supports the work of Dr. Bernadette T. Donovan-Merkert
              in the Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at
              Charlotte.  The research is directed toward electrochemistry as a means to
              carry out selective asymmetric synthesis, based on the electrochemical
              reduction of olefins and imines in the presence of palladium complexes with
              chiral ligands.   Reactions of this type have the potential of producing useful
              pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals under mild conditions and with high
              selectivities for the desired product in an environmentally benign fashion.
