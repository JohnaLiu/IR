POWRE:  A Transaction Management
              Technique for Nomadic Multidatabases
Gruenwald, Le

This project allows the
              PI to venture into the new research areas of mobile databases and
              mutlidatabases that are recently determined to be of extreme importance  for
              future database research.  The proposal addresses development of a
              pre-serialization transaction management technique for the mobile multidatabase
              environment that addresses disconnection and migration.  Further, the PI
              proposes development of an analytical model and a simulation model that will be
              used to compare the performance of the proposed technique to that of other
              techniques found in the literature, and to provide guidelines to assist both
              users and designers.
