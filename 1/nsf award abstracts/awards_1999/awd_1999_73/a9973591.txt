The PI will gain
              expertise in a new research area, namely nanophase and submicron particle
              synthesis, with the support of experts in the field.  The proposed research
              centers around the need to produce high quality ceramic powders for advanced
              electronic and structural applications.  Composite powders must be composed of
              uniform, high-density, submicron particles.  Aerosol flow reactors provide a
              promising technology for producing high-quality powders since these processes
              are both low-cost and environmentally friendly.  Novel methods will be
              investigated to re-direct thermophoresis away from the reactor wall during the
              combustion nitradation synthesis of aluminum nitride.  The overall goal of the
              proposed work is to develop a model that describes particle production and
              growth in aerosol flow reactors characterized by highly exothermic reactions. 
              In addition to thermophoresis, the model will incorporate the effects of
              coagulation and coalescence, and thus will be capable of predicting final
              particle size and morphology.  

Although the focus of the proposed work is
              on the direct nitradation of aluminum in aerosol flow reactors, the fundamental
              understanding of thermophoresis and its incorporation in a particle dynamics
              model will provide the framework necessary to extend this work to the synthesis
              of various fine nitride (e.g., HfN, Mo2N, TaN, TiN, and ZrN), as well as other
              powders produced using similar exothermic processing.

This award is made in
              response to the POWRE solicitation.
