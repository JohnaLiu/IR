              Enhanced Vision ---Eyes from Eyes

The focus of this research is on designing
              and constructing new ways of assembling a set of video cameras in order to
              collect  images whose analysis will provide accurate models of shape and
              action, such as human movements.  The research is motivated by examining the
              wide variety of eye design in the biological world and obtaining inspiration
              for an ensemble of computational studies that relate how a system sees to what
              that system does (that is relating perception to action.)  This, coupled with
              the geometry of multiple views points to new ways of constructing powerful
              imaging devices which suit particular tasks in robotics, visualization, video
              processing, virtual reality and various computer vision applications.
