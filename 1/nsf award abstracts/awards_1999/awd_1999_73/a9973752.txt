Abstract    :
              This POWRE award provides funds for participation of the PI in high energy
              physics experiments that investigate B decays as a tool to probe some
              fundamental facets of the interactions of quarks and leptons.  Particular
              attention is to be devoted to the phenomenon of CP violation, which may explain
              the stability of matter in the present universe.  Accompanying this research
              project is an education project to develop broader instruction in
              instrumentation within the undergraduate curriculum.  The award is funded by
              the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS Directorate.
