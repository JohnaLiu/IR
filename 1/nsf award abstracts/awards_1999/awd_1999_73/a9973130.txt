In this renewal the investigators propose to
              continue developing and applying ab initio molecular dynamics techniques to
              investigate the physical properties of major constituents of the earth's
              mantle. The primary method used here consists of first principles variable cell
              shape molecular dynamics. The technique was developed by Wentzkovitch and has
              been successfully used to investigate structural and elastic properties of
              several mantle phases at zero temperature, and structural phase transitions at
              high pressures and temperatures in silica and metals. This is a novel approach
              that is capable of addressing problems of geophysical importance such as: 1)
              prediction of high pressure crystal structures and their pressure dependence,
              2) a priori prediction of phase transitions, and 3) fully anharmonic high P, T
              thermodynamic properties such as thermal expansivity and elastic constants. The
              investigators propose to further extend these studies to more complex and
              potentially important hydrous and aluminous phases, and high temperature
              studies of properties including the equation of state and the elastic
              constants. The aim of this research is to predict and provide a firm
              theoretical basis for a more rigorous discussion of the physics and chemistry
              of the mantle and its dynamics.
