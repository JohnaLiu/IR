This POWRE award supports a project to study theoretically and
              numerically the propagation of light in highly scattering turbid media, such as
              biological materials, and its possible application in optical characterization
              and structural imaging of the media.  Funding through this award will enable
              this beginning PI to establish an independent and viable research activity as a
              component of a new biomedical physics program being established at the
              University.  The award is funded by the Physics Division, the Division of
              Mathematical Sciences, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the
              MPS Directorate.
