Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to develop a gene integration cassette for
              mammalian cells which eliminates the resistance selection problem common in DNA
              engineering efforts. All of the PI's previous work has been in yeast, and this
              proposal represents a significant move into mammalian systems which are quite
              different. A reusable selection cassette will be used for the gene insertion
              after which it will be removed and used for subsequent integrations. The use of
              this technique will be evaluated in two cell lines, CHO cells and a human
              alveolar epithelial cell line.
