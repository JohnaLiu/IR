Abstract    :
              The PI is completing Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) training, and
              initiating research on barrier island dynamics using LIDAR data from the
              coastline of Hatteras and Ocracoke barrier islands.  The PI is using LIDAR
              topographic data from 1996, 1997 and 1998 to quantify severe storm impact along
              a portion of the eastern US barrier island system.  She will 1) quantify
              shoreline position and change on an annual basis during intervals with and
              without storms, 2) quantify the volume of material eroded and accreted both
              along and across the barrier islands, 3) assess the variation in barrier island
              response of sections of the island that were heavily stabilized by fences and
              vegetation during the 1930's and 1940's, and 4) quantify the change in length
              and position of beach cusps during storm and non-storm years.
