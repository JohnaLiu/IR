Abstract    :
              The research is focused on the synthesis and characterization of hollow tubular
              nano-structures formed by hydrogen bonding interactions between amide and
              carbonyl groups of macrocyclic monomers, each of which contains two urea units
              linked to form a donut shaped building block.   The Y linker units in
              (-YHNCONH-)2 contain aromatic rings to keep the cyclic monomers planar, and can
              be chosen to provide a variety of tube dimensions and hydrophobicities.  Based
              on known molecular structures, the repeat distance between donuts is expected
              to be 4.61 Angstroms.    The tubes, which are expected to self-assemble in
              solution, will be characterized by proton and carbon NMR, STM, and x-ray
              diffraction.  

With this POWRE award the Chemistry Division supports the
              work of Linda S. Shimizu in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the
              University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC.   The proposed research will
              explore the synthesis and characterization of hollow organic tubes of
              controlled molecular dimensions which are expected to find uses as ion and
              small molecule transport devices, sensors and catalysts.
