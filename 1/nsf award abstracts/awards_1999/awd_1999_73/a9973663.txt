Abstract    :
              This POWRE project supports a career change that will enable the PI to undertake
              a leadership role in teacher preparation at her institution.  California State
              University, Northridge is a large urban university in the Los Angeles area with
              roughly 1400 students majoring in the Liberal Studies Pre-Credential Option. 
              Most of these will become elementary school teachers.  The PI has been active
              in teacher preparation and now is making a major career commitment in that
              area.  This project includes

*  work developing a "Blended Program" that
              offers a teaching credential after nine semesters;

*  significant
              participation in the in-service teacher training program;

*  running
              intensive summer school programs for elementary school teachers to improve
              basic math and science skills; and

*  development of a math methods course
              to be run in tandem with the basic subject matter courses for pre-service
              teachers.
