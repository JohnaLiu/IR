POWRE:  Techniques in
              approximation algorithms and polyhedral combinatorics for problem in network
              design and routing

This grant will provide the PI with an opportunity to
              spend the fall'99 semester at the Fields Institute of Research in Mathematical
              Sciences in Toronto, Canada to participate in the special semester devoted to
              combinatorial optimization.  The concentration of the PI's efforts will be in
              three particular problem areas: (1) development of efficient algorithms for
              solving problems in network flows, and in particular network flows overtime,
              (2) development of polynomial-time separation algorithms and approximate
              separation algorithms for the traveling salesman problem and (3) the network
              reinforcement problem in network security.
