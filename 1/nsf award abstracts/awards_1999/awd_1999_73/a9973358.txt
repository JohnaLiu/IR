An award under the POWRE program will support a one-year
              residence at the Graduate School of Education at Berkeley.  There, the PI will
              complete three projects that aim at making the engineering learning process an
              explicit part of course design, helping students understand the nature of
              expert knowledge, and providing intellectually stimulating outreach activities.
              The first project will articulate a set of instructional goals for an
              undergraduate soil mechanics course and use applications of cognitive science
              results to achieve these goals. The second project will develop a "Habits of
              the Mind" seminar with emphasis on the core paradigms in selected scientific
              and engineering disciplines.  The third project will design the infrastructure
              for K-12/ university learning partnerships of mutual educational value. 
              Support is provided under the POWRE program because the project is a
              significant deviation from, and enhancement to, the investigator's regular
              career path.
