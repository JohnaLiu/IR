This POWRE award will allow the PI to assist in the on-site
              diagnosis of the performance of the suspensions in the initial LIGO detector,
              in particular, with respect to their interaction with the rest of the control
              systems.  The investigation will provide the necessary information for the
              design of future, better suspensions.  Being on site during the critical period
              of initial LIGO testing will provide an opportunity for the PI to work toward
              assuming a leadership role in the LIGO effort.  The award is funded by the NSF
              POWRE program, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS
              Directorate, and  the Physics Division.
