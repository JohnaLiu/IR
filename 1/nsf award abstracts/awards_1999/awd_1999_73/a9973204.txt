     The investigator studies complex geophysical flow
              phenomena
modeled by finite or infinite-dimensional deterministic
              or
stochastic differential equations.  The research focuses on
transport and
              mixing in random geophysical flows, nonlocal
transport in geophysical flows,
              variational methods for
geophysical models, and stochastic geophysical flow
              modeling.  In
the area of transport and mixing, the investigator
              quantifies
fluid transport and mixing in geophysical flows by
              computing
escape probability and mean resident time.  The work on
              nonlocal
transport studies the mean advective and eddy transport of
passive
              tracers or pollutants in geophysical flows, when the eddy
diffusivity depends
              on time and space.  For the research on
variational methods for geophysical
              models, the investigator
gains better understanding of the rotating shallow
              water
dynamics, by studying steady patterns, spatial and temporal
periodic
              patterns and homoclinic motions via emerging techniques
in calculus of
              variations.  Finally, he derives a simplified
coupled atmosphere-ocean model
              by averaging over random wind
forcing and over intrinsic fast waves,
              quantifies the
approximation error of the averaged dynamics, and studies
              some
aspects of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system using this
averaged
              model.
     The geophysical flows in the oceans and the atmosphere
affect our
              environment and our society in profound ways.  This
project is motivated by
              the need of better scientific
understanding of the environment and global
              change.  The
investigator takes random or uncertain effects into account
              to
describe geophysical flows.  He develops both deterministic
              and
stochastic, numerical and analytical techniques to understand
complex
              geophysical flow phenomena.  This research improves our
knowledge about
              dispersion, transport and mixing of pollutants in
our environment, and about
              evolution and pattern formation of
geophysical flows.  The techniques
              resulting from this research
are also useful in studying other emerging
              problems in
engineering and applied sciences.
