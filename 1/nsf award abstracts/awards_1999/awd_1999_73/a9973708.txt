Abstract    :
              This POWRE award supports a Visiting Professorship at the University of
              Barcelona, Spain, where the PI will carry out a research project on
              non-perturbative effects in quantum field theories in the presence of external
              fields with trivial and nontrivial topology.  The visit is expected to help
              cement a collaboration with experts in this research area and provide new
              insights for continuing the work once the PI has returned to her home
              institution.  Four different areas of emphasis have been identified for study
              during the visit, involving application of mathematical tools to problems
              ranging from condensed matter physics to cosmology.  The award is funded by the
              NSF POWRE program, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS
              Directorate, and  the Physics Division.
