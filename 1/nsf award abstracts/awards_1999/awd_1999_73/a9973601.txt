Approximately eight million surgical procedures are performed
              annually in the United States to treat individuals who have lost tissue or
              organs through a variety of disease processes and injuries.  Tissue or organ
              loss is typically treated by transplantation from one individual to another, by
              surgical reconstruction, or by the use of mechanical devices.  Unfortunately,
              these treatments may allow temporary repair only and may introduce further
              complications.  Tissue engineering is the development of biological
              replacements, in which cells can be taken from the patient, expanded in
              culture, cultivated, combined with an absorbable polymer matrix, and implanted
              in the patient.  Once implanted, the polymer gradually disappears as, in
              parallel, the tissue develops and gains form and function.  Because the
              implanted cells are derived from the patient, the need for immunosuppression is
              eliminated, as are problems associated with traditional organ donation
              procedures.  This research, with support from a POWRE award, will focus on
              novel methods of creating absorbable scaffolds to enhance vascularization
              potential and a novel, non-invasive method of assessing these sensitive
              constructs.  The development of vasculature is critical to the progression of
              tissue engineering; since, currently the major impedance to developing viable,
              three-dimensional tissue is the challenge of providing a vascular support
              network.  The study will address the precision patterning of absorbable
              scaffolds and the optimization of scaffold morphology, cell-scaffold
              interaction, and cellular distribution throughout the scaffold. The NSF POWRE
              funding is vital to establishing a record of independent research during the
              PI's transition from postdoctoral fellow to faculty.
