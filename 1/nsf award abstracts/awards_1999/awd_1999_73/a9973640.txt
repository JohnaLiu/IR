The objective of this POWRE proposal is
              to examine the resistance of cerebrovascular endothelial cells (CVE), the
              lining of blood vessels, to viral infection using Theiler's virus as a probe
              based on the induction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC).  The
              hypotheses is that control of MHC (that is the resistance to its induction) is
              crucial for resistance to infection of these cells and, hence, demyelination.
              The major preliminary findings are that the resistant mice do not express the
              MHC I or II protein, whereas both sensitive and resistant cells express
              IFN-beta mRNA and activity, and also MHC I mRNA. The transcription factor NF-kB
              is present in the nucleus at low levels in the sensitive cells, but not in the
              resistant cells, and it increases in both sensitive and resistant cells after
              virus infection.   Four aims are proposed: to test if MHC expression is at the
              level of transcription; to analyze interferon-mediated transduction signals in
              CVE; to test if the lack of MHC expression is due to a regulation of
              transcription factors and, to estimate the number of inerferon receptors on
              CVE.
