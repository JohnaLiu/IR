This project supported under the POWRE porgram will focus on a
              new approach for the automated interpretation of multi-sensory data associated
              with underground infrastructure. The study employs the use of neural network
              systems and fuzzy estimating logic to indicate the condition of the underground
              utility. Sanitary sewer systems are selected to test the proof-of-concept,
              since the maintenance of sewer systems is an increasing priority worldwide.
              

Support from the commercial co-developer of the system and from the Civil
              Engineering Research Foundation will enable the PI to access field data
              collected using the new multi-sensory data acquisition technology.  The POWRE
              award will also enable the research team to observe the operation of the first
              multi-sensory sewer data acquisition technology in the U.S and to use the
              automated interpretation scheme to analyze data from different types of sewers,
              operating under different conditions.  Support is provided under POWRE because
              the experience with the new technology is considered to provide a significant
              enhancement of the PI's technical expertise and corresponding career
              prospects.
