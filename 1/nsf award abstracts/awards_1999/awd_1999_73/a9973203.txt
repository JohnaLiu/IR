     The investigator and his colleagues study a series of
              new
mathematical problems appearing in the area of laser stability
problems
              and in the area of biochemical oscillators.  The laser
problems are singular
              perturbation problems that result from the
different time scales of the laser
              dynamical variables or that
appear in the study of delay-differential
              equations modeling
semiconductor lasers.  All these problems are motivated
              by
experiments that are done in collaboration.  The biochemical
oscillator
              problems are also singular perturbation problems that
appear in models of
              cascading enzyme reactions describing, for
example, mitosis.
     An
              important part of the research activities concentrates on
laser instabilities.
               Lasers are used in many applications
(communication, surgery) and are part of
              our every-day life
(laser printers, bar code reading at the supermarket,
              CD
players).  But these lasers are often unstable devices.
Mathematical
              difficulties in analyzing the responses of these
lasers have prevented their
              control.  The investigator and his
colleagues propose to use more advanced
              mathematical techniques
in order to solve these problems.
