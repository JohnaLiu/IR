Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to  identify the major cost drivers associated
              with the use of advanced composite materials in full scale production
              rotorcraft structures.  the investigation will involve consulting with various
              rotorcraft industry and government personnel to identify general and specific
              problems inherent with the use of advanced composite materials.  Selection of
              potential research areas aimed at reducing the costs associated with the
              design/analysis/manufacturing processes will be performed. The viability of the
              application of structural optimization procedures in such will be considered. 
              The support from a POWRE award will enable the investigator, after a major
              career hiatus, to take advantage of a unique opportunity to re-establish
              industry linkages while establishing a research area in the analysis and design
              of advanced composite rotorcraft structures aided by structural optimization
              techniques.  It is expected that both educational and research opportunities
              will be enhanced by this activity.
