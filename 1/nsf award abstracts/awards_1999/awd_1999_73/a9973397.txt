Abstract    :
              The research project is focused on developing a new analytical tool in
              mathematical geophysics based on using the Riemann-Hilbert approach  to the
              solution of scattering problems in inhomogeneous geomaterials. Topics of
              investigation include: (i) A Lax pair formulation of the  vector elastodynamic
              equation; (ii) The Riemann-Hilbert approach to  diffraction problems in a
              quarter plane and in a corner; (iii) The Riemann-Hilbert approach to 
              scattering of  elastic waves at a vertical interface.  The principle objective
              of the research is to derive  integral representations of the solutions for the
              indicated problems, which would involve integration along some contours in the
              complex plane. Special features of the new method, and, most importantly, the
              fact that this method does not require  separation of variables, allow one to
              expect the possibility of moving beyond the limitations of the traditional
              Fourier,  sine,  cosine or Laplace transforms.

The theory of elastic waves
              plays an important role as one of the principal sources of information about
              the structure of various parts of the Earth. Specifically, the mathematical
              models considered in the project form the  theoretical basis to study fractured
              vertical deep fault zones, transition zones between the different blocks as
              well as in-situ properties of soil and geologic materials.
