Abstract    :
              Advances in satellite remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems
              (GIS) technologies are contributing to rapid expansion in the availability and
              use of spatial information about Earth's environment at local to global scales.
               They have also led to the use of new methods in spatial analysis based on
              computational intelligence (CI).  Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are one type
              of CI that have been widely used in geography and RS for classification, change
              detection, optimization and spatial modeling. The main objective of this
              research is to apply ANN for spatial scaling, particularly aggregation and
              disaggregation resulting from the use of multiscale and multiresolution data in
              GIS and RS.  Three specific areas of geographical enquiry will be addressed: 
              first, characterization of land cover at the global scale, including improved
              estimates of land cover area as well as changes in land cover area; second,
              developing models integrating socio-economic and physical data collected at
              different spatial scales (e.g., Mediterranean Desertification and Landuse or
              MEDALUS); and third, the population census zone design problem, in which data
              are aggregated from fine to coarser spatial scales.  This type of spatial
              analysis and modeling has a number of practical applications including census
              geography, global change research, land surface characterization, strategic
              landuse and transportation planning, environmental analysis and planning, and
              allocation of education, health, and other services.  This research, which will
              focus on analytical and methodological issues centered around ANN applications
              in geography and remote sensing, will involve collaboration between the
              principal investigator and  two leading European researchers.  The POWRE award
              will enhance the principal investigator's research and educational experience,
              as well as contribute to her academic advancement and contribute to her
              leadership potential in the field in which women are significantly
              underrepresented.
