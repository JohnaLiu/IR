Abstract    :
              The PI is conducting a systematic investigation of the relationship between
              cyanobacterial mats and microbial biofilms, and small marine worms found to be
              associated with them.  She hypothesizes that the microbial mats are grazed from
              underneath by the worms. The research aims to 1) ascertain the types of benthic
              organisms living in association with a modern microbial mat, 2) ascertain the
              spatial distribution of the benthos relative to the mat, 3) ascertain the
              preferred feeding location and foodstuff of a particular species of
              mat-associated worm, and 4) identify and characterize the feeding and fecal
              traces of mat-associated worms.  Results of this investigation will provide
              insights into modern and ancient mat communities.  Modern mats are useful in
              oil remediation efforts and ancient mats hold clues about the timing and
              environmental location of the earliest evolution of triploblastic animals.
