This project is a unified theoretical and experimental study
              of the adsorption of polymer micelles at surfaces.  The polymer micelle
              exterior is made up of polyacids which can respond to changes in solution pH
              and/or ionic strength.  It has been found that these two parameters control the
              density of polymer micelle attachment to an aminated surface, but the exact
              mechanism for this control is not understood.  Experimental aspects of the
              project will include (1) synthesis of various block copolymers by anionic
              polymerization, with control of the lengths of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic
              blocks; (2) preparation and characterization of micelles formed by these
              copolymers; (3) attachment of these micelles to aminated or other modified
              surfaces under various pH and ionic strength conditions and characterization of
              the surfaces.  Theoretical aspects of the project will extend the current
              understanding of polyelectrolyte brushes and the competition between chain
              distortion and energetically favorable acid-base interactions.  Advances in
              theory will be used to help guide experiment and the results of experiment and
              the results of experiment will be used to test the predictions of
              theory.

Besides the intrinsic interest in these novel structures, the
              project may lead to valuable advance the fields of, control of cell adhesion to
              surfaces, drug delivery, chemical sensing, and optical data storage.
