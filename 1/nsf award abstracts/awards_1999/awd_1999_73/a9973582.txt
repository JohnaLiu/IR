The PI will spend one month at the Institute for Learning
              Sciences at Northwestern University.  The Institute for Learning Sciences at
              Northwestern has pioneered the use of scientific visualization techniques for
              K-14 education.  They are one of the few education research groups to pay
              attention to earth and environmental science education, through the (former)
              Co-VIS project and the (active) Supportive Scientific Visualization
              Environments for Education Project.  By working with this group, she will
              deepen her understanding of cognitive science as it pertains to learning and
              understanding she will learn from their prior experience in constructing and
              testing learning environments, and in transforming scientific visualization
              tools into tools for science education.  During my visit to Northwestern the PI
              will read deeply in the relevant literature, and talk constantly with faculty
              and graduate students who know and care about cognitive science and education. 
              She will have Black Rock Forest and learn-to-read-maps development efforts
              critiqued by experts in learning and cognition, and by people who have built
              and tested effective computer-supported learning environments.  She will watch
              Worldwatcher, the Progress Portfolio, and other learning tools in use in K-14
              classrooms.  And she will watch the project staff as they watch the students
              and teachers, to better understand the iterative process by which such tools
              can be improved.  Her host and guide on this self-motivated, self-directed
              educational venture will be Professor Daniel Edelson, Principal Investigator of
              the Supportive Scientific Visualization Environments for Education Project, the
              Collaboratory Notebook Project, and the Supportive Inquiry-Based Learning
              Environments project.
