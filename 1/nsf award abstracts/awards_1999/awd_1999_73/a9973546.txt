Abstract    :
              This is a POWRE  project to allow the PI to take a sabbatical leave to work in
              the
laboratory of Dr. Michael Sussman at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
              This fits the criteria of a POWRE award since: 1) this research concerns an
              area of plant science completely different from the PIs research focus on
              stomatal guard cells; 2) this research will provide a critical exposure to the
              new fields of plant genomics and proteinomics, including "hands-on" experience
              with a number of techniques which will subsequently be applied to the PI's own
              research area; 3) also under the auspices of the POWRE award, the PI will work
              with Prof. Edgar Spalding (also at the University of Wisconsin, Madison) on the
              improvement of an undergraduate laboratory exercise in plant electrophysiology,
              with the goal of incorporating this laboratory into her own teaching.
Dr.
              Sussman's laboratory is in the process of identifying T-DNA null mutants in all
              of the 35 -40 genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome that encodes
              calmodulin-domain kinases (CDPKs). Preliminary data from Dr. Sussman's
              laboratory suggest that CDPKs 10 and 11 may be involved in plant responses to
              saline conditions, with cdpk10/11 mutant plants showing improved survival when
              plants are grown on elevated NaCl in the absence of K+.  Salinity is an
              important agronomic problem, affecting >7% of arable land world-wide.  The
              experiments will test two hypotheses regarding CDPKs 10 and 11 and plant
              response to salinity: Hypothesis 1 It is known that plant K+ deficiency is a
              major aspect of salt stress. It is therefore hypothesized that wild type CDPKs
              10 and 11 (and/or other CDPKs) reduce salt tolerance by down-regulating a K+
              uptake transporter; in the cdpk 10/11 mutants such down-regulation is missing,
              and so salt tolerance is improved. This hypothesis will be tested by: 1)
              measuring growth, K+ uptake, and Na+ uptake in wild type vs. cdpk 10/11 mutant
              plants grown under limiting vs. sufficient K+ conditions; 2) measuring the same
              factors in triple mutants that I will produce between cdpk 10/11 andthe K+
              uptake channels akt1 and kat1; and 3) determining that complementation of the
              cdpk 10/11 mutant with the wild type CDPK 10/11 genes restores the wild type
              phenotype.  Hypothesis 2 The presence of Ca2+ can reduce the deleterious
              effects of NaCl on plant growth and K+ status. It was recently shown that the
              SOS3 protein has homology to the regulatory subunit of the Ca2+-activated
              phosphatase, calcineurin, and is necessary for this Ca2+ effect (Liu and Zhu,
              1998, Science 280: 1943). sos3 mutant plants are deficient in K+ uptake. It is
              therefore hypothesized that SOS3/calcineurin and CDPK 10/11 target the same K+
              transporter (either directly or through a signaling cascade), with wild type
              SOS3/calcineurin upregulating that K+ transporter under saline conditions and
              wild type CDPK10/11 downregulating that K+ transporter. To test this
              hypothesis: 1) growth, K+ and Na+ uptake will be evaluated in cdpk 10/11
              mutants vs wild type plants under saline conditions with different levels of
              Ca2+; 2) phosphorylation assays will be conducted to identify (as spots on 2-D
              gels) root proteins whose phosphorylation status is enhanced by wild type CDPKs
              10/11 and reduced by wild type SOS3. Such proteins will be sequenced and
              identified using the technique of tandem mass spectrometry
