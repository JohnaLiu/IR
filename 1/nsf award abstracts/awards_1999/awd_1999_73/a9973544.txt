Abstract    :
              The scientific community has recently turned focused attention to the carbon and
              nitrogen cycles, with the recognition that gaps in the basic knowledge of the
              biogeochemistry of these elements is impeding ability to make important policy
              decisions.  While the main focus has been on CO2, it is widely acknowledged
              that other trace gases, particularly CH4 and N2O, are significant players in
              the greenhouse story.   The goal of this work is to study the effects of
              elevated CO2 on the production and consumption of CH4 and N2O using the
              Biosphere 2 facility. Biosphere 2 encloses controlled 'mesocosms' of varying
              complexity and environmental conditions, offering a chance to study natural
              processes at an intermediate scale between the laboratory and the field.  This
              study will be carried out as part of a larger collaboration to use Biosphere 2
              to better understand the processes that regulate the exchange of CO2, H2O, CH4,
              N2O, O2, isoprene and other trace gases between the atmosphere and terrestrial
              biosphere.  The nature of the proposed work is exploratory, and will result in
              the design of process-based studies that make optimal use of the Biosphere 2
              facility.  It follows on a year of infrastructure development and data
              gathering to determine a baseline for the Biosphere 2 system.

The proposed
              work is designed to address the following two questions:  1) What is the effect
              of elevated CO2 on CH4 and N2O exchange with rainforest and forestry soils in
              Biosphere 2; and 2) What is the effect of elevated CO2 on CH4 flux from
              wetlands?  Follow-up work will result in process-based studies and the
              expansion of the research program to include NOx and stable isotope work.  A
              key aspect of this award is the support of two workshops to bring a team of
              interdisciplinary experts to Biosphere 2 to advise on experimental design and
              initiate collaborations.  Work inside Biosphere 2 will build on and support
              future field and laboratory studies.  This exploratory work on the
              interdependencies of trace gas fluxes inside Biosphere 2 will serve as the
              first phase in the PI's development of a new research emphasis in terrestrial
              nutrient cycling.

This POWRE funding will help the PI transition from
              administration to a combination of research and teaching/curriculum development
              for the next several years, and reestablish the scholarship that will sustain
              the PI's longer-term career.
