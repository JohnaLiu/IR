The proposed POWRE grant will enable me to pursue my career
              goals.  These goals are to:

(a)Impact changes in undergraduate mathematics
              education by providing sound research upon which curriculum developers and
              instructors can base reforms;
(b)Become a better teacher of mathematics,
              becoming part of a community of mathematics teachers at the university level
              focusing on student learning; and
(c)Become a source locally, nationally, and
              internationally for discussions about and innovations in curriculum and
              instruction at the undergraduate level.
