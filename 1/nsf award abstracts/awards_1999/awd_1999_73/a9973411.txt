This POWRE research plan is based on laying the groundwork
              that will lead to more fruitful collaboration in the future with other faculty
              members and ultimately the creation of a research consortium on computational
              intelligence for geophysical data processing.  The groundwork consists of
              gaining the necessary background in seismic data processing through reading,
              coursework, and training, becoming knowledgeable about progress in
              computational intelligence over the past three years and acquiring the
              necessary hardware and software to conduct the research.  The work will be
              divided into three phases: study of seismic processing with a particular focus
              on types of seismic attributes; re-acquiring knowledge of the current state of
              neural network research and other forms of computational intelligence; and
              applying neural network processing to seismic data with focus on reservoir
              property predictions.  Because of the PI's extensive involvement in the
              implementation of a new general education curriculum and administrative
              responsibilities as the head of the Commission on the Status of Women, she has
              been removed from active research for the past three years.  Her research area
              is geophysical data.  For most of her career she has focused on electrical and
              electromagnetic geophysical techniques.  She will re-establish her research
              program by moving into a new research area and learning about seismic data
              processing and how computational intelligence techniques such as neural
              networks can best be applied in that area.
