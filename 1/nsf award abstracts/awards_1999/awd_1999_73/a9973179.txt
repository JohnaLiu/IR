Abstract    :
              This project uses advanced data collection and simulation technology to help
              students link models to data. In the context of collecting temperature data and
              modeling heat flows, students will work their way up from simple objects,
              characterized by a single temperature, to larger and larger systems that
              exhibit increasingly complex behaviors. We will create technology that enables
              the simultaneous collection and analysis of data from multiple, spatially
              separated but otherwise identical probes. We will also implement a modeling and
              simulation tool with which students can describe their models to the computer,
              run them as simulations, and compare the results to the experimental data they
              have collected. We will work with seventh and eighth grade students at two
              schools, one urban and one suburban. We will continue to evaluate the
              knowledge, thought patterns, and attitudes toward science of these students as
              they enroll in science courses in high school. Our goal is to help students
              recognize that neither theories nor experiments embody ultimate truth in
              science, that either may be iteratively revised to account for anomalies, and
              that the creation of scientific knowledge is ultimately driven by this
              interplay.
