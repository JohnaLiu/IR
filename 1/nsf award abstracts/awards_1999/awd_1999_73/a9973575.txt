Abstract    :
              The research involves the synthesis and subsequent decomposition in the vapor
              phase of a variety of cobalt complexes with various metal oxidation states and
              ligands chosen for the right combination of complex volatility and stability.  
              CVD (chemical vapor deposition), optionally with a silicon precursor, will be
              used in a search for compounds and conditions that produce electronic
              device-quality CoSi2 on a single crystal silicon surface.  The deposited films
              will be characterized with a variety of surface analysis methods, including
              AES, XPS, SIMS, and SEM, and the results used to guide the synthesis
              effort.

With this POWRE award the Chemistry Division supports the work of
              Dr. Hyungsoo Choi at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology
              at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.   She will use the chemical
              vapor deposition (CVD) of volatile cobalt complexes to prepare  electronic
              device-quality CoSi2 on silicon surfaces.   Well formed films of CoSi2 of
              controlled microscopic dimensions would be very useful for highly miniaturized
              (nanoscale) electronic semiconductor devices.
