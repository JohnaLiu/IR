Abstract    :
              This grant will facilitate a natural change in the P.I.'s research emphasis to
              Industrial Mathematics.   The shift in her research emphasis from nonlinear
              dynamics Industrial Mathematics serves both a personal research objective and a
              leadership objective in the training of employable mathematics students.
              Industrial Mathematics is still in its early stages as a field and
              participation in it at this point could increase the P.I.'s influence in the
              applied mathematics community, with increased potential for leadership roles in
              future.  

The research proposed involves investigations of chatter
              instability in high-speed machining.  Chatter is a self-excited oscillation
              between the machining tool and  the work piece that limits productivity of
              machining operations, reduces the quality  of the product and shortens machine
              tool life.  Up until recently, models have been primarily linear, with delay
              terms in the case of regenerative chatter.  Nonlinear models are currently
              being developed, and have had some success in predicting behavior that may be
              described in part by low dimensional systems.  In the aircraft industry this
              problem has received intense scrutiny, and
the work of the P.I.'s collaborator
              at Boeing (Dr. Abe Askari) has been in the development of finite element models
              for metal cutting.  A union of the two techniques, large scale numerical
              simulation and low dimensional models, is the goal of the research in this
              proposal.
