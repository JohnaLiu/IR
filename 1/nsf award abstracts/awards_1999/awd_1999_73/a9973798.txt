Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to study the applicability of phytoremediation
              to the treatment of wastewaters containing alkylphenol polyethoxylates
              (APEO's), widely used nonionic surfactants, and to determine how these
              compounds are transported and degraded in a plant-based sytem.  Plant species
              and plant systems best adapted for the degradation of alkylphenolic compounds
              will be identified and evaluated in controlled laboratory and greenhouse
              experiments.  Batch and flow-through systems will be used to measure and
              elucidate the mechanisms of contaminant removal by phytoremediation. 
              Collaborative relationships will be established with researchers and designers
              of plant-based treatment systems and the results of this phytoremediation
              research will be integrated into a senior/graduate level course on biological
              treatment processes.  With the support of this POWRE grant, the investigator
              will develop this new area of research and collaboration during a year of
              sabbatical leave.
