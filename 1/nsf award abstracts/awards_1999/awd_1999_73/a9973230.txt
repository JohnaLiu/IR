Abstract    :

     The goal of this project is to develop biophysical
              models
and the accompanying mathematical techniques to describe
              the
generation of temporal codes by the activity patterns of networks
of
              neurons.  The investigators focus on a robust temporal code,
called phase
              precession, that has been experimentally found in
the firing pattern of
              pyramidal cells in the hippocampus of
freely moving rats.  This temporal code
              is believed to signal the
animal's location in a known environment.  The
              investigators apply
a modeling approach consisting of three complementary
              methods:
mathematical analysis of networks of simplified neurons,
simulations
              of networks of biophysical neurons, and functional
modeling that incorporates
              and interprets experimental recordings
from freely moving rats.  The
              mathematical approach, using
geometric singular perturbation theory, exploits
              the multiple
time scales inherent in the intrinsic descriptions of the
              cells
and the synapses between these cells.  Simulations are performed
on
              networks of conductance based neurons.  Genetic algorithms,
previously
              developed by the researchers, and bifurcation
continuation programs aid in
              analyzing the simulation results.  A
goal of the analysis and simulations is
              to make experimentally
verifiable predictions.
     The hippocampus is a
              primary target for epilepsy and
Alzheimer's Disease and has a well established
              role in memory
function and in spatial navigation abilities.  The
              dynamical
interaction between neurons in the hippocampus may be
              described
using temporal coding schemes.  In order to detect
              potentially
pathological dynamics of these neurons, it is essential to
              first
understand how these coding schemes are constructed under
              normal
circumstances.  More generally, a fundamental goal of neuroscience
is
              to understand function from the single neuron level to the
systems level.  The
              objective of this project is to bridge all of
the levels of detail for one
              specific system, the hippocampus.
This work will also lay the mathematical
              foundation for research
in other areas of the brain where temporal codes
              exist.  Funding
for the project is provided by the program of
              Computational
Mathematics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in
              MPS
and by the Computational Neuroscience program in BIO.
