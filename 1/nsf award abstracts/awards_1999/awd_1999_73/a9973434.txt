Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to improve the quantification of nonpoint
              source emissions of particulate matter and the spatial and temporal
              distributions of these emissions.  Nonpoint sources of particulate matter
              pollution remain one of the major unknowns in quantifying anthropogenic aerosol
              inputs to the atmosphere.  Elastic lidar can overcome the limitations in
              vertical range and spatial and temporal resolution that hamper point sampler
              studies of fine particulate mater transport from nonpoint sources. However,
              lidar currently cannot directly quantify particulate matter concentrations. 
              The proposed research will (1) develop a new field technique that provides a
              measurable boundary value constraint for lidar signal inversion, and (2) use
              the new method to calibrate the UC-Davis scanning elastic lidar so that the
              backscatter signal can be interpreted in terms of fine particulate matter mass
              concentration.  Lidar calibration experiments will be conducted under highly
              controlled conditions using a field aerosol chamber.  The calibration method
              will be extended to field conditions using real fugitive dust plumes generated
              during agricultural land preparation operations.  Through the research to be
              conducted under this POWRE grant, the investigator is in the process of
              shifting her primary research emphasis from groundwater remediation and
              geochemistry to air quality and air pollution.
