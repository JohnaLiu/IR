Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to identify point defects and impurities in ternary
              chalcopyrites such as AgGaS2 and AgGaSe2. These materials are promising
              nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals for laser radiation frequency up- or down-
              conversion in the middle infrared (2-20 um) spectral region. The approach is
              based on the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The
              focus is on crystals doped with Cr for the purpose of making a laser active
              medium suitable for the mid-IR. The lasers that presently serve this range
              demand careful crystal alignment and have other sensitive operation
              requirements. The doped chalcopyrite-based lasers are expected to be
              comparatively simple to operate. Such systems are important for scientific
              studies of a variety of molecular species and for commercial or military
              applications requiring atmospheric transparency.

This is a research
              enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in
              Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic
              materials science knowledge relevant to the understanding and development of
              photonic materials for advanced technological applications. The
              interdisciplinary project involves collaborations across physics and materials
              science, and also places emphasis on the integration of research and education
              by incorporating graduate and undergraduate student participation into research
              related to classroom activities. The project is co-supported by the Division of
              Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities).
