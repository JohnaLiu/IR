Abstract    :
                    This Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education
              (POWRE) project addresses fabrication and characterization of ultrafine grained
              (Ba,Sr)TiO3 (BST) and related materials, such as BaTiO3 (BT) and SrTiO3 (ST) as
              sputtering targets using a reactive process.  These materials in thin film
              condition are very important dielectric constituents for the next generation
              computer chips.  These sputtering targets are used in producing thin films.  It
              is proposed to trigger these reactive processes in pressed powder compacts
              using a hot wire.  The thermodynamics, kinetic studies as well as reaction
              mechanism studies will be performed.  The microstructure will be characterized
              and correlated to the processing parameters.  
      The reactive process is
              economical, uses inexpensive raw materials, and has low energy requirement. 
              The reactive process also has possibilities of industrial scaling up.  This is
              important to the career development potential for this new Principle
              Investigator in starting up her career. The education component of the work
              will focus mainly on two activities: modification of an existing material
              processing course for the senior/graduate students and involvement of
              undergraduates to the advanced processing research area. It is expected that
              this POWRE project will provide opportunities for future research with
              significant industrial interest, allowing this new faculty member to focus on a
              new set of materials while advancing her expertise in the thin film deposition
              area.
