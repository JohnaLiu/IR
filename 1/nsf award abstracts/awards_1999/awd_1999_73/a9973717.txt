One common earthquake-induced geotechnical hazard is soil
              liquefaction, the loss of strength in loose, cohesionless soils during
              earthquake shaking.  To avoid the devastating damage associated with
              liquefaction, potentially liquefiable soils are treated to prevent
              liquefaction.  Drainage is one available liquefaction remediation technique;
              however, its effectiveness has not been fully documented.  This research
              project, under support by a POWRE award, will study the effectiveness of
              drainage as a liquefaction remediation method using large-scale,
              earthquake-like ground motions generated by the RESCUE (Repeatable Earth
              Shaking by Controlled Underground Expansion) ground motion generation
              technique.  The study of drainage methods for liquefaction remediation is
              critical because drainage provided by prefabricated, composite drains is the
              only remediation method appropriate for sites with existing structures. 
              Additionally, the test series will demonstrate the applicability of the RESCUE
              technique to study the dynamic response of geotechnical systems and pioneer a
              new testing technique for geotechnical earthquake engineering research. 
              Support under the POWRE program is provided to enable the PI to obtain
              experience with experimental techniques which will complement her analytical
              capabilities.
