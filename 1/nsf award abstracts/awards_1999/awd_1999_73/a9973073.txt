PALEOIMMUNOLOGY

This study seeks to address the
              question "can proteinaceous compounds sufficient to be recognized by antibodies
              persist in fossils of various ages?"  I propose to approach this question from
              two directions:  1) to test the reactivity of antibodies raised against modern
              proteins for reactivity against extracts of various fossil specimens, and 2) to
              use extracts of fossil specimens as immunogens to determine if they are capable
              of eliciting an immune response in animals.  If they are reactive, then these
              "anti-fossil" antibodies will be tested for cross-reactivity to modern proteins
              to identify the source proteins in the fossil extracts. These studies will be
              supplemented with other analytical tests of the fossil specimens, so that more
              than one line of evidence can be used to support the hypothesis that these
              molecules arise from the fossils (ie, are endogenous) and not from recent,
              outside contamination.  Finally, if it appears that endogenous biomolecules do
              persist within fossil tissues, the depositional setting and sediments will be
              analyzed to seek to identify a correlation between depositional environments
              and preservation.
