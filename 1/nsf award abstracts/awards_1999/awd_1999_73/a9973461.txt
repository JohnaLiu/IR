A concerted observational and theoretical effort
              to investigate the distribution of luminous and dark matter in superclusters of
              galaxies will be carried out.  The studies of superclusters are of fundamental
              importance because they provide information about how light traces mass and how
              the mass-to-light ratio varies on the little explored distance scales of 10
              Megaparsec and greater.   Robust measurements of the mass-to-light ratio on
              such large scales are also more likely to give a representative value for the
              fundamental parameter, Omega, that is important in deducing the matter density
              of the universe.  The technique of observing gravitational lensing effects may
              be used to study the distribution of matter in the Universe, and this research
              project will be one of the first attempts to apply the gravitational lensing
              method on supercluster scales.

The research has three components: (1) Data
              acquisition via optical wavelength observations. In order to maximize the
              feasibility of detecting gravitational lensing signals, the 10-meter Keck
              telescope in Hawaii will be used to obtain high-quality images and spectra of
              two carefully chosen superclustering fields; (2) Data analysis of the
              observations in both the strong lensing (gravitational arcs) and weak lensing
              (correlated distortion in images of background galaxies) regimes will be used
              to construct the mass density maps; (3) A theoretical study of systematic
              effects and the dependence of lensing signatures on cosmological parameters
              will be carried out.  Numerical simulations, on supercomputers, of various
              plausible cosmological models will be performed to quantify the level of
              contamination due to intervening mass fluctuations in the lower-density
              intra-cluster regions of superclusters. These numerical simulation results will
              be used to allow the statistically significance of the observational results to
              be assessed.
