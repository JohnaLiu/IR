Static and flow-through hydrothermal experiments will be
              performed on mafic and ultramafic rock compositions similar to those known to
              exist on the surface of Mars.  Experiments will be performed at temperatures
              from 25-400 degrees C using CO2 -saturated aqueous fluids or CO2 -steam
              mixtures.  The fluid compositions used will range in salinity from 1000 ppm to
              several wt % total dissolved chloride and sulfate, and in starting pH from 2 to
              8.5.  Fluid - rock ratios will range from 20:1 to 1:20.  Temperature and
              fluid-rock ratio are expected to strongly control the extent of alteration,
              while fluid composition should affect the mineral assemblage produced.  The
              results of these experiments will be used to determine the conditions under
              which known Martian rock samples such as ALH84001 were altered by fluids in the
              Martian crust.  This information will provide insight into the amount of water
              to which known Martian rocks have been exposed and thereby into past hydrologic
              conditions and the water budget in the Martian crust.  It will also indicate
              the conditions under which primitive life forms might have existed in ancient
              hydrothermal environments on Mars.  Finally, the experimental data should aid
              in the interpretation of any new Martian rock samples acquired either as
              meteorites or by sample-return missions.
