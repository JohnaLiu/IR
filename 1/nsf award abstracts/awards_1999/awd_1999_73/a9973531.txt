CISE/POWRE: Strategies
              to Add Redundancy for Graceful Degradation of  Image and Video Quality over
              Lossy Packet Networks

This project will develop, analyze, and apply new
              algorithms to assign unequal erasure protection (UEP) to progressive data to
              provide graceful degradation against packet loss.  If severe packet loss
              occurs, the most important data would be received by the decoder instead of the
              less important data.  These new algorithms will be practical in that they will
              lead to improved image and video quality at the receiver in cases of high
              packet loss rates.  Our new algorithms will have practical use in many arenas
              including the Internet and wireless communications.
