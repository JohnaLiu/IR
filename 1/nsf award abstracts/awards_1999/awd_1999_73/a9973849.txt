The objective of the investigation is to develop a
              basic model or approach that accurately quantifies PAH partitioning and
              accounts for deviations from EqP theory predictions as a function of particle
              properties.  This model may then be used to predict overall PAH distribution
              patterns in sediments, sediment-pore water partition coefficients and
              associated bioavailability of these compounds.  Such information is necessary
              for accurate assessment of the environmental risk of contaminated sediments and
              remediation of contaminated areas.  In addition, results from this work will
              provide insight into the basic relationships between organic matter reactivity
              and its physical and chemical properties; such an understanding will prove
              useful in other, non-contaminant, geochemical studies.  This POWRE proposal
              represents a new direction in the PI's academic career, into field-based marine
              research that builds upon strong background in laboratory studies of surface
              geochemical processes.  As such, it represents a critical stepping stone as a
              marine science faculty member.  In addition to being research that directly
              addresses a pertinent scientific question, this work logically leads to broader
              marine research that integrates field and laboratory approaches.  This POWRE
              proposal will foster her growth towards that rare scientist who fully
              integrates field and laboratory studies, and strengthen her position as a
              tenure-track faculty member at a marine institute dominated by senior male
              faculty.
