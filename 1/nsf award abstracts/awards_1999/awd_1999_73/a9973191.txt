This project proposes to employ new body waveform modeling
              tools to image fine scale upper mantle structural variations near the North
              American margin.  A secondary goal is to assess the accuracy of tomographic
              velocity models in terms of the synthetics they produce.  The phases modeled
              will be broadband, triplicated direct- and multiple-S waveforms from events
              along the East Pacific Rise, Gulf of Alaska, and Aleutians.  For these sources,
              the array provides a single source record sections with identifiable phase
              moveout of triplicated S and its multiples.  The centerpiece technology of this
              work includes a recently developed ray algorithm applicable to 3D tomographic
              models which is derived from the WKBJ method.  This method will be used to
              systematically examine upper-mantle and transition-zone structure along the
              western margin of North America by modeling triplicated S phases.
