The problem of finding the maximum-volume ellipsoid inscribing a
              given polytope in n-dimensional space has many important application
              potentials.  However, the lack of practically efficient algorithms and software
              for this problem has so far hampered its actual applications in practice.  The
              proposed project will attempt to rectify this situation.  Firstly, we plan to
              develop and implement efficient, practical algorithms and portable library
              software for solving the problem.  The algorithms to be studied will be
              variants of infeasible primal-dual interior-point methods.  Secondly, we will
              utilize the resulting software to develop and implement algorithms for integer
              programs that have non-binary variables varying in wide ranges and are
              difficult to solve for conventional branch-and-bound techniques.

Given a
              polygon on the plane, what is the largest ellipse that can fit inside the
              polygon?  This question can be easily generalized from the two-dimensional
              space (the plane) to higher-dimensional spaces, resulting in the so-called
              maximum-volume ellipsoid problem.  In many cases, the amount of computing time
              required for solving this problem determines how fast we can solve more
              complicated problems in applications, for example, problems in manufacturing
              and managerial decision-making processes.  In this project, we will develop
              fast methods and build efficient computer code for solving the maximum-volume
              ellipsoid problem, and then apply the code to solving application problems.
