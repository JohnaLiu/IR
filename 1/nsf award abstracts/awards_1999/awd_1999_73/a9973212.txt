     The investigators systematically develop and
              analyze
mathematical models of biological invasions.  Their aim is
              to
understand how three key factors (species interactions,
environmental
              heterogeneity, and demographic stochasticity)
affect the invasion process. 
              The models take the form of systems
of nonlinear integrodifference equations. 
              They test their models
with data from a nascent, biologically simple invasion:
              the
spread of lupine and its caterpillar herbivore into the Pumice
Plains
              region of Mount St. Helens following its 1980 eruption.
     Invasions by
              exotic species -- species like zebra mussels,
gypsy moths, and purple
              loosestrife -- are occurring more
frequently than ever before.  In one recent
              year, 456 million
exotic plants were imported into the United States. 
              The
biological and economic consequences of these invasions can be
dramatic;
              estimates of the damage done to agricultural crops by
exotic species run in
              the billions of dollars.  A key to
controlling the spread of exotic species is
              a scientific
understanding of the factors that determine how fast they
              spread
across the landscape.  One way to obtain this understanding is
through
              the use of mathematical models of the invasion process.
The investigators
              construct and analyze invasion models that
incorporate an important biological
              reality that has often been
missing in other studies: the fact that invaders
              interact both
with their prey and often with simultaneously
              introduced
predators and competitors.  They test the predictions of
              their
models with data from actual biological invasions that occurred
in the
              wake of the eruption of Mount St. Helens.  The insight
they gain from these
              studies will help environmental managers
deal more effectively with invading
              nonnative pest species.
