Abstract    :
              This is a POWRE award.  The scientific focus of this project will be the
              establishment of a bacterial two-hybrid system for analysis of the interaction
              between plant calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) and their substrates.
              The PI will spend the first six months of the project in Dr. Jeffery Harper's
              lab where the basic system will be set up. This work will require extensive use
              of recombinant DNA techniques and will provide the opportunity to improve
              cloning skills and streamline laboratory procedures. The bacterial two-hybrid
              system will be useful for identifying which members of the large Arabidopsis
              CDPK family interact with and phosphorylate a given protein. Materials
              generated in this project may be developed in the future into a system for
              screening cDNA libraries for substrates of CDPKs. This work will contribute
              basic knowledge that will help reveal details of this large family of
              multifunctional protein kinases whose physiological roles are not well defined.
              In the second six months of the project, the PI will prepare samples of
              phosphorylated CDPKs and substrates and analyze these for the sites of
              phosphorylation in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Sussman  using electrospray
              mass spectrometry.
