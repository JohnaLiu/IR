Close collaborations with theoreticians will be
              established to carry out research on one of the outstanding problems for
              understanding young stellar objects surrounded by accretion disks, namely, the
              origin of their winds. The aim of these collaborations is to interpret the
              theories and create observational diagnostics, taking advantage of results from
              computer models and data from observations.  The diagnostics will allow the
              discrimination between theoretical models and will finally identify the region
              in the star-plus-disk system where the stellar wind is formed. 

A deeper
              knowledge of the different theoretical frameworks, and of the wind structures
              that they predict, will be acquired.  The results from the models of
              theoretical structures will be combined with powerful radiative transfer
              methods to develop spectral diagnostics, which will allow the effective
              identification of the region of formation of the wind in young accreting
              objects. Visits to experts in the field, such as F. Shu at the University of
              California - Berkeley, R. Pudritz at McMaster University, and A. Konigl at the
              University of Chicago, will be carried out to discuss research results and plan
              future research projects. There will also be an active collaboration with Paola
              D'Alessio in Mexico concerning the development of detailed vertical structure
              disk models.
