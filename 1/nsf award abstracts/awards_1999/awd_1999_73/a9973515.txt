A significant fraction of public and private
              astronomy resources are now committed to large survey projects, and this trend
              is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Past survey databases, such
              as the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) and the Infrared Astronomy
              Satellite (IRAS) surveys, have been invaluable for selecting samples for future
              investigation.  Current and future databases will also provide a unique
              opportunity to address important scientific problems without requiring scarce
              resources such as large telescope time. The independent researcher who is
              willing to spend the time and effort to understand the database, and the
              process of accessing it, can carry out "observing runs" at the computer, mining
              the database for most or all of the data needed to carry out the project.
              

One result from the activities of the project will be to understand the
              best ways to access databases for efficient and accurate retrieval of data. 
              There will also be scientific results from research projects on magnetic
              activity in M dwarf stars and the galactic structure and star formation history
              of the solar neighborhood.  These research activities will be a testbed for
              database mining.
