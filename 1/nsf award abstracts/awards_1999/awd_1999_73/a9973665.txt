This POWRE Award will integrated circuit mass-production
              processes are plagued with the problem of low catastrophic (defect-induced) and
              parametric (variability-induced) yields both of which can be mitigrated through
              more accurate modeling and tighter control of the IC manufacturing process.  
              As the technology for miniaturization advances, transistors- the basic
              microelectronic circuit building block-scale down in size form 1.5 um to 0.25um
              in length.  At the soma e time, the tolerance variation problem becomes more
              serious because disturbances do not scale down proportionally.  
The problem
              of interconnect crosstalk arises from electromagnetic coupling between signal
              paths on a chip which if left unoptimized may cause logic hazards, signal delay
              and circuit malfunction.  A variety of schemes for modeling crosstalk noise
              including FDTD and spectral analysis are the subject of intense research;
              however more generalized cost-effective methods are needed.
A novel ANN-based
              tool which allows a designer to explore and constructively exploit the
              interrelation between the performance and parameters of an integrated circuit
              will be investigated.
A survey of pertinent literature shows that
              computationally intensive evaluation of highly non-linear analytic functions is
              today being replaced by more convenient and cost effective mathematical
              constructs such as artificial neural network (ANN's),  look-up tables and
              response surface approximations.
Research will be carried out collaboratively
              over a 12-month period at three sites.  University of Hartford (the proposer's 
              home institution),  Georgia Tech (ECE Intelligent Semiconductor Manufacturing
              Group ) and Imperial College, London (Circuits and Neurosystems Design
              Groups).
