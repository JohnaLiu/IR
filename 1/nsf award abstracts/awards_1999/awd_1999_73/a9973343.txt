This project will search for second order optical nonlinear
              generation in mixed valent materials at terahertz frequencies.  In mixed valent
              materials, there is an energetic overlap between f electron states and the d
              electrons in the conduction band.  The results of this project will provide new
              fundamental insight into the presence of ground state coherence between the f
              and d states.  The presence of such coherence results in a breaking of the
              crystalline inversion symmetry, which makes second harmonic generation allowed.
               The coherence will also mean that these materials form a new class of
              electronic ferroelectrics.  Because the bandgap in these materials amounts to
              only 10 meV, it is resonant with very far infrared light.  To generate
              sufficiently intense pulses at these wavelengths, we will use the process known
              as terahertz generation that is based on amplified ultrashort visible pulses. 
              The results of this project will provide important feedback to the theory,
              which is related to a wide range of materials that display electronic
              correlation.

              students with broad training in both areas.
