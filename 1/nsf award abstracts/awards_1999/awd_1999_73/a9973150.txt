The large lakes of East Africa are sensitive indicators of
              climatic change.  Fluctuations of these lakes register rainfall variability in
              a large continental region of the tropics prior to the availability of actual
              rainfall measurements.  In prior work, the P.I. produced detailed
              reconstructions of the fluctuations of 10 lakes since 1800.  To better
              interpret these fluctuations, an accurate assessment of the water balance of
              Lake Victoria was made and a hydrologic model of its year-to-year fluctuations
              was developed.  The model was applied to quantifying the rainfall conditions
              that produced these fluctuations.  Here, we propose to extend our work to other
              East African lakes.

The ultimate goals of this study are to produce improved
              esrtimates of water balance for selected African lakes, to develop models of
              the lakes' interannual fluctuations, to invert the models to interpret the
              lakes' past rainfalls, and to determine the lakes' sensitivity to other
              environmental parameters.  The most concern is assessment of rainfall and
              cloudiness over the lake.  Direct information on these terms is so difficult to
              obtain that they have been assessed from shoreline stations.  Because of the
              influence of the shore, this approach does not provide an adequate picture over
              the lake itself.  In our study, high-resolution satellite data will be used to
              determine cloudiness and rainfall directly over the lakes.  This is
              particularly important for the larger lakes where mesoscale circulation systems
              alter the patterns of rainfall and cloudiness.

The results of the project
              will be reliable estimates of water balances for African lakes, simple models
              of internannual fluctuations, a quantitative assessment of rainfall conditions
              throughout the nineteenth century, and a generic tool that can be later applied
              to interpreting paleoclimate from the high-resolution sedimentary record.
