Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of physiological ecology
              and is entitled "Physiological adaptations in reptiles and amphibians."  This
              study encompasses a field study of overwintering behavior and acid-base status
              of painted turtles, characterization of the lactate transport mechanism and
              determination of the fate of lactate in desert reptiles,  and a study of anoxia
              and acidosis in the reptile heart using NMR spectroscopy.  This combination of
              field work and biochemical techniques addresses the suite of physiological
              mechanisms that match metabolic oxygen and energy requirements with
              environmental oxygen supply and conditions.
