Abstract    :
              Research will be carried out in the following three, connected, areas: modern
              quantum gravity including supergravity, string theories and their M-theory
              successors; classical gravities, and quantum theory of fields.  Included is the
              study of black hole entropy on a microscopic, fundamental, level, one of the
              keys to verifying that the underlying program of unification of all forces of
              nature is on the right track.
	This is a period of unprecedented activity in
              quantum gravity.  It is now at the center of our attempts at unification, and
              has been the central thread in the progression that has led from Einstein's
              classical gravity to supergravity to string theory and its current exciting
              extensions such as M-theory.  As in any "frontier" research, better
              understanding of the connections is still required and will be obtained in
              continuing this progression.
