This award supports Vincent Mooney and graduate students from
              Georgia Tech University in a collaboration with Lennart Lindh at the Center for
              Real-Time Systems of the Malardalens University, Sweden.  The project will
              focus on the principles of hardware/software co-design applicable to the
              implementation of real-time operating systems for the next generation of
              systems on a chip.  The result of the work will be a new understanding and
              quantification of the trade-offs among different implementation strategies. 
              Previously, a real-time operating system was considered something running on a
              processor with bandwidth-limited interaction with external hardware, mainly due
              to pin and packaging limitations.  Now, however, with systems on a chip, it is
              possible to split the operating system between hardware and software, leading
              to more flexible architectures that will result in improved designs and design
              implementation.
