Rhizosphere Respiration and root demography in forest
              ecosystems

The root influenced soil zone (rhizosphere) is one of the key
              components of the C cycle.  The proposed research will significantly enhance
              our understanding of a critical element of the rhizosphere, its respiration, by
              (1) determining the rhizosphere respiration in a forest, (2) linking the forest
              rhizosphere respiration with the population structure of the roots and (3)
              developing a tree rhizosphere respiration model.  The research will examine
              whether rhizosphere respiration is more sensitive than microbialrespiration to
              physical factors in the environment such as temperature.  This work will, for
              the first time, separate soil root and microbial respiration making it possible
              to examine all major C fluxes belowground.  An empirical model will be
              developed which will allow the creation of linkages between forest belowground
              C fluxes and the global C cycle.
