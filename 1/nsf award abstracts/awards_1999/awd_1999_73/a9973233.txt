     The principal investigator and his colleagues
              continue
developing the software package Magnus, which has been designed
to
              carry out computations in and experiments with, in the main,
finitely
              presented groups.  This software has been set up so that
it can be used
              remotely, via the internet.  This means that
researchers world-wide can use
              the software by logging on to the
Magnus server.  The project uses
              Internet-based facilities to
maintain a list of outstanding open problems and
              to set up
several discussion groups focusing on related mathematical
              areas.
These support collaboratory interactions among users,
              including
researchers in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong,
              and
China.  Software development includes the introduction of
              genetic
algorithms as well as measures to allow users to add their
              own
routines to Magnus, extending the scope of the tool.  The
investigators
              also use Magnus to study problems in pure group
theory and in commutative
              algebra.  The project includes the
training of students.
     In mathematics,
              group theory aims to capture and study the
essence of symmetry, particularly
              in patterns.  Such patterns
occur frequently in nature, for instance as
              crystals.  Its
connection with symmetry makes group theory important in
              physics,
in biology, and in the study of our physical world, as well as
              in
geometry and other mathematical fields such as the theory of
computation
              and cryptography.  The investigators' goal in this
project is to build an
              easy-to-use computational tool that makes
it possible for a user to carry out
              experiments and solve
problems about the most ubiquitous of the mathematical
              objects
involved here, the so-called finitely presented groups.  These
              are
groups that can be described completely by a finite set of
              rules;
examples include the group of rigid geometric motions of an
object and
              the groups of quantum mechanics.  The computational
tool, Magnus, has a simple
              but limited interface.  Nevertheless,
Magnus has already been used to explore
              and solve a number of
difficult problems in group theory.  The present project
              focuses
on algorithmic developments and techniques to allow users to
              add
their own routines to Magnus, extending the scope of the tool.
The
              project also provides Internet-accessible computation and
information
              resources in a collaboratory setting, fostering
Internet-based interchanges
              and collaborations among researchers.
Finally, the project helps train
              students in both computation and
mathematics.
