Abstract    :
              





Dr. Morris' long-term goal is to understand the hormonal and
              nonhormonal regulation of sulfate homeostasis (in the kidney and in other
              tissues).  Serum concentrations of sulfate are increased in pregnant women and
              are higher in the fetus and young children than in adults.  The mechanisms for
              the alterations in renal transport are not known.  This POWRE award will
              support exploratory work to determine the feasibility of using human and rat
              proximal tubule cell primary culture systems and a human proximal tubule cell
              line for the evaluation of factors that regulate renal sulfate transport.
