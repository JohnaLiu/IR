Drs. Boice and
              Huebner continue their theoretical investigations of the nuclei of comets,
              focusing on the recent comets Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake.  They will use dusty,
              reactive, fluid dynamics models to interpret the results of many recent
              observations, and include additional features in their modeling to attempt to
              better characterize these two recent comets.  Their specific goals in this
              study are to better understand the nature of CO sources in both comets, the
              parents and additional sources for molecules such as C2, CN, CH, and C3, the
              interaction between gas and dust, and the nature of HCN in the coma, and the
              effects of new dissociative recombination rates on the abundances of important
              species.  The larger goal of the project is to understand comets through global
              simulations that assimilate a wide variety of ground-based and space-based
              data.
