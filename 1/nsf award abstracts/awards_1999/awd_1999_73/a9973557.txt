Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of developmental biology
              and is entitled "Early steps in the development of the metazoan C. elegans."  
              The goal of this research is to increase understanding of the uniquely metazoan
              mechanisms of pre-mRNA processing during early stages of development.  This is
              being accomplished by characterizing two temperature sensitive Caenorhabditis
              elegans mutants that exhibit a mis-localization of trimethylguanosine capped
              RNAs, embryo lethality, and a defect in
chromosome segregation.
