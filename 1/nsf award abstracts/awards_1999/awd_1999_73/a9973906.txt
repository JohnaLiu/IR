Abstract    :
              This POWRE award provides funds that will allow the PI to assist in developing a
              new time-of-flight detector (TOF) that will constitute a component of the
              Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF), which is studying proton-antiproton
              collisions at high energy.  Work on the time-of-flight component of the CDF
              detector represents a departure on the part of the PI from her previous
              activities on the CDF experiment.  This award will allow her to handle
              different types of technical problems and thereby acquire new instrumental
              skills. The award is funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in
              the MPS Directorate and the Physics Division.
