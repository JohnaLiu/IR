CISE/POWRE: 
              Computational Problems Related to Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction   

This
              project supports the PI to spend one academic year at the University of Arizona
              in order to learn about computational problems related to phylogenetic tree
              reconstruction.  The grant provides the PI with an opportunity to achieve
              additional education and training in (a) computational biology and particularly
              in phylogenetics, (b) experimental computer science and (c) mathematical
              modeling.  This opportunity will help fulfill the PI's goal to move from being
              a pure discrete mathematician and theoretical computer scientists to applying
              her skills to real problems, and to incorporate experimental methods into her
              research.
