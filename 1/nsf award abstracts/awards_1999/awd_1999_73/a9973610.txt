Abstract    :
              Holland will continue her work on the construction and analysis of new models
              constructed in the style of Hrushovski as generics of strong amalgamation
              classes.  She proposes, with Baldwin, to apply their joint work to the problem
              of constructing a ``bad field".  Holland further proposes to clarify the
              notions
of relative flatness and relative CM-triviality, settling upon
              definitions and showing that the properties are, indeed products of the method.
               She intends to refine her analysis of flatness and to apply the results to the
              current examples to classify them by  degree of freeness of generation of their
              geometric structure. She further intends to determine the relationship between
              her own hierarchy of freeness and Pillay's notion of n-ampleness.   This POWRE
              project is supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).
