Abstract    :
              This proposal was submitted to the NSF-wide Professional Opportunities for Women
              in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The PI has a background in wetland
              ecology and is interested the role that wetlands play as a buffer between
              upland land-use activities and downstream water quality in coastal estuaries
              and bays.  She would like to expand her research via the use of landscape-scale
              dynamic spatial models. The proposal requests support for the PI to complete
              three tasks, which are 1) training in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
              which is essential for large-scale modeling/data acquisition, 2) initiation of
              a pilot project in Indian River Lagoon for assessing the feasibility of
              measuring changes in water quality and subsequent structure of submerged
              aquatic vegetation associated with the narrowing and potential loss of the
              wetland fringe surrounding coastal bays, and  3) to purchase and become
              familiar with the Stella modeling program.
