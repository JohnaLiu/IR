The recent discovery of cosmopolitan oryctocephalid and
              eodiscid trilobites across the Lower-Middle Cambrian series boundary in the
              North America and South China provinces allows the first direct correlation
              between the Old World redlichid and the New World olenellid faunal extinctions.
               The objective of this research is to document the trilobite faunas across this
              boundary on both continents, and compare the pattern of extinction, survival
              and recovery for the endemic species in the two provinces.  This study may
              provide enough evidence to ascertain whether there is a single, global mass
              extinction at the end of the Lower Cambrian, and whether faunal recovery
              patterns are similar in geographically separated island continents.  In
              addition, this study will provide a strong foundation for establishing an
              international stratotype boundary near the traditional Lower-Middle Cambrian
              series.

Undergraduate students will participate in an international effort
              to document the end-Lower Cambrian extinction and Middle Cambrian survival and
              recovery faunas across the Lower-Middle Cambrian series boundary.  Students
              will be involved in all aspects of data collection in the field and laboratory
              preparation, taxa identification, interpretation, presentation, and publication
              of results.
