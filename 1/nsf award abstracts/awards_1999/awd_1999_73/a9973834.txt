CISE/POWRE: 
              Applying Database Techniques to Management of Large Data Flows in Scientific
              Applications

This project supports the PI's research activities as a Postdoc
              at Georgia Institute of Technology.  To address the problem of large data flows
               and incompatibility between components, the PI is proposing a general
              middleware scheme called active streams: an approach for controlling data flow
              by injecting computational components directly into a data flow.  A
              computational component implements one or more event-action rules, in the style
              of active databases, where a set of events triggers a rule action.  To
              summarize the goal of the project is an architecture , abstractions, and
              algorithms for middleware components that are efficient in the internal query
              evaluation, and responsive to changes in the environment.
