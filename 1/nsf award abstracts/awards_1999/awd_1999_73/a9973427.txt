Abstract    :
              9973427

This proposed research aims at developing adaptive fast algorithms
              using wavelet bases in the Galerkin, Petrov-Galerkin, collocation, product
              integration and quadrature methods for both linear and nonlinear boundary
              integral equations whose solutions may have singularities.  We will also
              consider efficient evaluation of potentials which relates the solution of a
              boundary integral equation with the solution of the original boundary value
              problem.

The primary purpose of the proposed research is to understand how
              wavelet bases can be employed to improve the computational efficiency of the
              commonly used conventional numerical methods for boundary integral equations
              while preserving the attractive features of the conventional methods such as
              high convergence order and stability.  The ultimate goal of this project is to
              provide computationally efficient algorithms for high-performance computing in
              science and engineering.
