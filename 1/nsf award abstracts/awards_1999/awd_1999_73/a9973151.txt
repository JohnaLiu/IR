Professor
              Brown and his graduate students will observe, monitor, and model the
              atmospheres of the icy Galilean satellites.  These satellites provide the only
              opportunity in the solar system to compare four bodies which have similar sizes
              and temperatures, but have large differences in their atmospheres.  The
              similarities and differences among the satellite atmospheres will be used to
              study the processes that create, regulate, and destroy the tenuous atmospheres
              of these moons.  	The majority of the observations of the faint emission from
              these atmospheres will be made using the high resolution spectrograph on the
              10-meter Keck telescope.  The extended sputtered atmospheres will be observed
              by studying the resonant emissions of sodium with a method similar to that
              which has been used to study Io's extended atmosphere for the past two decades.
               A newly developed technique of monochromatic eclipse imaging of
              electron-impact excited atmospheric species will also be used to study the
              atmospheres much closer to the surface of the satellite.  This technique allows
              ground-based study of the dominant water-derived species, which, until now,
              have been detected only from space-based observatories.
