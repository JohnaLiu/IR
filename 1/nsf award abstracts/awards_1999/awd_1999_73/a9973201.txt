This award supports collaboration between researchers
              at the National Supercomputing Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State
              University and the Department of Nuclear Physics, Australian National
              University (ANU).  This award provides supplemental funding to PHY 9528844 to
              allow addition of an international component, collaborative work with
              Australia. The proposed collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to
              combine the knowledge of both groups to further enhance the understanding of
              magnetic properties of nuclei far away from stability.  

 The U.S. PI, Paul
              Mantica, has arranged an opportunity for work with ANU to perform measurements
              with stable beams during the period that the accelerator facilities at Michigan
              State are shut down. Researchers at ANU have a well-established and
              internationally recognized program that provides complementary experimental
              opportunities for the MSU group.  This supplemental funding will support travel
              to Australia by the PI and two US graduate students to plan and perform
              experiments using the 14-UD accelerator in the Department of Nuclear Physics at
              ANU.  Complementary measurements with unstable beams would be performed at MSU
              once the upgrade of the accelerator facility is complete.
