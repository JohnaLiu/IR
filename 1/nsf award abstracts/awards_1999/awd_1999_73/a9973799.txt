Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to describe and model behaviors in the common soil
              nematode C. elegans, a simple worm. The investigators will first develop a
              real-time, automatic tracking system to monitor and record over long periods of
              time, nematode behaviors such as egg laying, locomotion, defecation, feeding,
              and mating. They will then construct novel mathematical models to account for
              the observed behaviors and devise parameter estimation algorithms to quantify
              the behavioral data.

The researchers will attempt to identify the roles of
              specific neurons and neuro-transmitters in regulating these behaviors. They
              study C. elegans because its nervous system is extremely simple and well
              characterized at the anatomical level. This makes it practical to understand
              behaviors at the molecular and cellular level. Although the nematode nervous
              system is simplistic as compared to that of the vertebrate brains, the basic
              principles of neural activity are applicable across a wide range of organisms
              and so may the results of this study
