Mount Holyoke College requests $71,060 for 18 months to
              develop curricular materials that are engaging for all students and equally for
              young women, that do not draw too heavily on gender sterotypical areas yet use
              them as a starting point, and have significantly challenging mathematics --
              particularly geometry -- as their objective.  Specifically, the mathematical
              preparation of the PI will be improved, the PI will work with two female
              mathematicicans and one male mathematician whose research work would lend
              itself to challenging secondary mathematical curricular materials, drawing out
              challenging mathematics from the context of origami, and writing two curriculum
              prototypes with teacher guide materials drawn from each of the contexts above.
