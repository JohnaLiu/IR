Drs. Lake and Quinn will
              directly simulate terrestrial planet formation from a 3D disk of planetesimals
              with sizes comparable to asteroids.   Their models will have much greater
              spatial and temporal resolution than previous simulations and will use state of
              the art algorithms and processing.  With such simulations, they will address
              fundamental questions regarding the formation of planetary systems, among them
              the primordial mass distribution, the extent of radial mixing in the disk, the
              cause of mass depletion in the asteroid belt, the likelihood that the Moon was
              formed by a late massive impact, and the role of giant planets in terrestrial
              planet formation.
