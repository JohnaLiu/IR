Abstract    :
              This POWRE award provides funding that would allow the PI to expand on the
              initiation of a new activity that began as a consequence of a career transition
              from a large research institution to a smaller undergraduate institution. 
              Funds will be used to conduct first experiments and to foster the educational
              component associated with the research activity.  The research program itself
              focuses on the investigation of excited states of small molecules, states that
              are interesting from the fundamental points of view and states that are
              important in atmospheric photochemistry, combustion, and molecular reaction
              dynamics.  The award is funded by the NSF POWRE program, the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS Directorate, and  the Physics Division.
