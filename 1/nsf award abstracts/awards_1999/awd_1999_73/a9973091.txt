Abstract    :
              This research involves the investigation of state-of-the-art 3D image processing
              architectures and techniques along with their potential uses and applications.
              The investigation has applications in a number of areas such as System
              Modeling/Understanding, Verification and Validation, Predictive Engineering,
              and Potential Advances in Diagnosis and Treatment of Visually Impaired. Because
              of the number of different areas of application, there is a potential for
              bringing together researchers in computer science,
electrical engineering, and
              Optometry
(for biomedical applications).


Included in this study are the
              differences among various visualization techniques such as 3D Image
              Interpolation, 3D Image Extrapolation, and 3D Model Reconstruction & Rendering.
              The results of this research are used to determine the limitations in the
              various techniques as well as investigate novel applications where these
              technologies will provide further understanding.
