This POWRE award will enable the PI to implement new research
              ideas just acquired during a six-month sabbatical leave at the Institute for
              Theoretical Physics.  The research will focus on the theoretical study of
              singularities which form in generic gravitational collapse. Accompanying the
              research will be the development of a new computational physics laboratory
              based on a recently acquired parallel computing cluster, as well as other
              activities in curriculum revision and enrichment.  The award is funded by the
              NSF POWRE program.
