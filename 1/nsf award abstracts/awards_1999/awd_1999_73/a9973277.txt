Abstract    :
              

A POWRE award supports the PI for a year's works as visiting researcher at
              Caltech with the primary purpose of changing her career path from industry to
              academe after she has spent a number of years in industry.  She will
              participate in a research project which involves the constitutive and fracture
              characterization of quasibrittle materials subjected to a variety of leading
              rates.  Several constitutive and numerical issues will be addressed, including
              the effect of rate, decohesion,plastic-damage and fragmentation. Constitutive
              characterization will consist of the development and calibration of a rate
              dependent constitutive model in the context of damage-plasticity and
              viscoplasticity.  The model should be capable of representng quasibrittle
              material behavior over a broad range of rates, from quasistatic to dynmaic,
              permitting a calculation of damping.  Fracture characterization will be studied
              based on the use of cohesive interface finite elements.  Crack initiation, slow
              and dynamic growth data and arrest measurements on marble specimens will be
              used for the appropriate choice of cohesive traction laws describing the
              decohesion process.
