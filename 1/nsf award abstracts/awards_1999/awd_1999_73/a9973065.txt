	The apparent phylogenetic gap between Cambrian and
              post-Cambrian trilobites has long been recognized as one of the fundamental
              problems in the history of the group.  It prevents a clear understanding of the
              origination of new groups of trilobites during the major reorganization of
              marine communities that took place during the Ordovician.  By comparison,
              relationships between major groups of post-Cambrian trilobites are well
              understood, and this has been achieved by the application of cladistic
              techniques and, especially, by comparative studies of ontogenetic development
              of silicified material.  Similar treatment of Cambrian trilobites has been
              hindered by the scarcity of silicified faunas.  This proposal will study newly
              discovered, diverse Cambrian silicified faunas of the Great Basin.  They have
              the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the relationships between
              Cambrian and post-Cambrian trilobites, and to finally place the Ordovician
              radiation in its proper phylogenetic context.
