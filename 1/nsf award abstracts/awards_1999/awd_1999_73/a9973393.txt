The investigator and his colleagues study issues in
              computational differential equations: shadowing and related topics of global
              error analysis for initial value problems, computation of stability information
              and Lyapunov exponents, and analysis and computation of lattice differential
              equations, i.e., differential equations that are discrete in space and
              continuous in time.  This project has as a central theme the combination of
              dynamical systems ideas with numerical analysis ideas.  The focus is on the
              development and analysis of efficient, accurate numerical techniques and on
              analytical and computational techniques that help identify interesting dynamic
              properties of differential equations.

The investigator and his colleagues
              study methods for understanding the propagation of errors that occur during the
              numerical computation of differential equations.  This understanding is
              fundamental because models of physical and biological systems are often solved
              using computational techniques.  The research on lattice differential equations
              has applications in the area of materials modeling.  The models being
              considered allow for the inclusion of both microscopic and macroscopic effects,
              which will become more important as advances in computer technology allow for
              larger, more sophisticated models of materials.
