CISE/POWRE:  Software
              Evaluation:  The Application of Software Testing Techniques to Rule-Based
              Natural Language Processing Components

This research will bring together the
              two fields of software testing and natural language processing (NLP) by
              applying software testing techniques for rule-based systems in the specific
              domain of NLP systems. The specific goal of this research is to adapt and
              extend an existing approach for coverage-based testing of rule-based systems in
              order to develop new methods for evaluation of rule-based NLP systems.  In
              addition, the research will incorporate a study of how the accuracy of an NLP
              component affects the performance of a larger system, examining the robustness
              of systems which use some form of NLP and their ability to withstand
              inaccuracies in the analysis carried out by an NLP component.  This research
              will be undertaken in the context of a number of research projects currently
              underway at Columbia University under the auspices of the Center for Research
              on Information Access and  the Natural  Language Processing group of the
              Department of Computer Science.
