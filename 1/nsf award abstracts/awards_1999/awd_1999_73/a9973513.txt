One to two million adults are affected in the United States
              by heart failure with 200,000 deaths annually.  30-50% of these deaths are
              sudden and have been attributed to cardiac electrical abnormalities. 
              Electrocardiology, the study of electrical characteristics of the heart, plays
              a major role in prediction and prevention of sudden cardiac death.  Although
              much research has been performed to attempt to predict sudden cardiac death, no
              long-term studies have tracked the electrocardiographic progression from normal
              to diseased state.  Furthermore, little work has been done to analyze the
              electrocardiogram (ECG) in the weeks, days, and hours before a spontaneous
              event in order to establish a short-term electrophysiologic predictor of sudden
              cardiac death.  If a sudden death episode could be predicted, long- and
              short-term interventions could be attempted to prevent the event.  The overall
              goal of this proposal is to develop and use an adriamycin rabbit model of heart
              failure to study the electrocardiographic progression from normal to a sudden
              death event. Animals will be outfitted with a long-term implanted ECG system.
              ECGs will be recorded continuously for the lifetime of the animal through
              radiofrequency-telemetry.  Classical ECG features as well as innovative
              features will be calculated by computer and monitored over the lifetime of the
              animal where particular attention will be paid to changes preceding an event.
              The main goal of this work will be the development of a short-term prediction
              scheme which could predict an impending event such that in the clinical setting
              preventions/interventions, like electrical therapies may be performed.
