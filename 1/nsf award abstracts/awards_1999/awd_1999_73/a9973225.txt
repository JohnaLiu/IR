This grant supports two young faculty members in
              condensed matter physics at the Georgetown University. There is also an
              international component with Croatia funded by the International division.  The
              grant supports theoretical and computational studies of several effects that
              are not included in the standard Migdal-Eliashberg treatment of electron-phonon
              superconductivity.  A combination of first-principles electronic structure
              calculations and many-body theoretical techniques will be used to study these
              effects in real materials.  The work will help elucidate how and when the
              conventional theory of electron-phonon superconductors breaks down in real
              materials, and will contribute to development of better methods for
              understanding the properties of superconducting materials.

This grant is to
              support research of two young faculty with complementary interests and
              expertise in the theory of superconductivity. The grant is funded jointly by
              the Divison of Materials Research and the International division.  A major
              difference between the conventional superconductors and essentially all of the
              ones that have been discovered recently (doped fullerenes, high Tc materials)
              is that the theoretical framework, so successful in superconductivity in
              conventional materials, cannot be applied to the new materials. This project
              will  analyze difficulties and find solutions for them.
