Cooperation is often thought to reflect a delicate balance
              between partners whose interests fundamentally conflict.  It has therefore been
              hard to understand how these interactions, both among humans and among other
              organisms, apparently persist so successfully.  This POWRE award will be used
              to examine when "cheating" - that is, defection from cooperation - can pose a
              risk to the persistence of cooperative interactions between different species
              (mutualisms).  The research will focus on interactions between plants, the
              animals that pollinate them (mutualists), and the animals that collect nectar
              but that not only do not pollinate, but actually damage the flowers (cheaters)
              employing the development of new theoretical models.  This work should make a
              significant contribution towards our understanding of the remarkable ubiquity
              and apparent stability of cooperation in nature.
