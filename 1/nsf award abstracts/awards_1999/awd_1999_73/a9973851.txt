There has been research in the last two
              years toward the development of adaptive filter technology for radio telescope
              receivers. Radio frequency interference (RFI) is the radio equivalent of light
              pollution, which has become a serious problem in radio astronomy.  A prototype
              adaptive receiver has been constructed and tested. The Florida Institute of
              Technology will donate a 3-meter radio telescope to Valdosta State University. 
              The Valdosta State University (VSU) is a public university of 10,000 students.
              This donated instrument will be a great asset for training students, doubling
              as a teaching tool, and a platform for astronomical research. This on-site
              radio telescope at Valdosta State University will be used to continue testing
              the latest design of adaptive receivers.  There will be close collaboration
              with faculty in physics at VSU on the project.  Undergraduate students majoring
              in physics, astronomy and engineering will be involved in the project. 
              Students will have access to the telescope for carrying out research projects. 
              A new course on radio astronomy will be developed as an addition to the current
              undergraduate physics and astronomy curriculum.   The contents of this new
              course curriculum, which is related to the reaching of radio astronomy, will be
              presented as a model for teaching radio astronomy.   Information on the course
              will be disseminated at professional scientific and engineering
              meetings.

              Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
