Lay Abstract

Dr. Christine Li is interested in how
              nerve cells in one region of the nervous system communicate with nerve cells in
              a different region.  Nerve cells use chemicals, called neurotransmitters, as
              their means of communication; one nerve cell secretes a neurotransmitter that
              is received by another nerve cell, causing the latter cell to respond in a
              specific manner.  The regulation of neurotransmitters is finely modulated
              within the nervous system.  Too little or too much of a neurotransmitter can
              have severe repercussions on the behavior of an animal, such as uncoordination
              or cognitive disorders.  Dr. Li is examining the regulation of
              neurotransmitters in a simple model system, the roundworm Caenorhabditis
              elegans, where the simplicity of the nervous system and the ability to
              manipulate the animal genetically allows use of approaches not readily
              available in other systems, such as mammals.  She is focusing on a certain
              class of neurotransmitters called neuropeptides, which are small proteins. 
              Over 100 distinct neuropeptides are present in C. elegans; these peptides can
              be subgrouped into families based on their structural similarities.  Dr. Li is
              studying a specific family of neuropeptides called FaRPs.  About 50% of the
              nerve cells in C. elegans use FaRPs for communication between cells.  The
              questions that the laboratory is addressing include determining the functions
              of different FaRPs, determining why only certain cells use FaRPs for
              communication, determining whether one FaRP can substitute functionally for
              another FaRP, and determining how a FaRP secreted from one nerve cell can cause
              a certain response in a second nerve cell.  Insights into how neuropeptides
              function in C. elegans may give clues into how neuropeptides are used in higher
              animals, such as man.
