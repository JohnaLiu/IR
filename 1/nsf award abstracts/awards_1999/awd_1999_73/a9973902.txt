This POWRE award provides supplementary support for the PI's
              activities as Physics Analysis Coordinator for the BaBar experiment, a major
              international collaboration of about 600 experimental particle physicists
              designed to investigate the source of differences in the time evolution of
              matter and antimatter.  The role of Analysis Coordinator, who reviews all
              aspects of the BaBar experimental analysis, is critical to the efficient
              management of the BaBar activity, especially during the 1999-2000 academic
              year, when the first experimental results will be appearing.  The present
              funding allows the PI to devote full time to this effort, thus strengthening
              her position within the collaboration.  The award is funded by the NSF POWRE
              program, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS Directorate, and
               the Physics Division.
