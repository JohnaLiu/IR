Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will conduct research on noncommutative algebras at
              the University of California, San Diego (September 1 - December 24, 1999), and
              at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in 
Berkeley, California 
              (January 1 - June 30, 2000), during the program on "Noncommutative Algebra." 
              This research leave will enable her to focus on her existing research problems
              in noncommutative algebra, with the goal of providing a better understanding of
              the structure of noncommutative rings.  She will continue her work on
              homological and dimension theoretic questions in noncommutative rings (e.g. the
              Auslander-Gorenstein condition and the filter dimension), on the properties of
              down-up algebras and their
application to the representation theory of
              differential partially ordered sets, and on properties of superalgebras.  The
              research leave will also provide her with new methods in noncommutative
              algebra, particularly in noncommutative algebraic geometry and combinatorial
              algebraic techniques; she will also learn more about applications to quantum
              groups and related rings. The ten month research leave will help her become
              better able to pursue the important questions in noncommutative algebra.  This
              POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary
              Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
