This observational program will
              make use of the newly upgraded radar system at the Arecibo Observatory in
              Puerto Rico to study carbonaceous mainbelt asteroids (MBAs). Carbonaceous
              asteroids are thought to be relatively unaltered from the primordial solids
              that condensed in the outer solar nebula.  The outermost asteroids probably
              have complex organic molecules on their surfaces.  The radar-derived data will
              be used to set constraints on target shape, topography, rotation state,
              composition, and near-surface roughness to define similarities and differences
              between the various taxonomic classes containing dark objects and between
              carbonaceous MBAs and other asteroids. The project is a logical outgrowth of
              recent statistical analysis of all MBAs detected by radar prior to the Arecibo
              upgrade. Many asteroid targets will be detected at moderate signal-to-noise
              ratio (SNR) using Doppler-only (continuous wave) techniques. These first-time
              detections will be used to build up data samples within each of the
              carbonaceous taxonomic classes. A smaller number of targets will produce echoes
              with high enough SNR that time-resolved signals can profitably be utilized. The
              "delay-Doppler" images that result from binning the echo, both by arrival time
              and by frequency, will be used as the input to shape-modeling analyses. The
              analyses will yield constraints on the target's pole-on silhouette for datasets
              with SNR approaching 100, and can also involve three-dimensional shape
              reconstruction for SNR values of several hundreds.  The software tools to be
              used will include both commercial packages and radar-specific programs
              developed by a research group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
