Research will focus on minerals believed to occur in the
              Earth's upper mantle and transition zone, but will also involve studies of
              relevant phases that provide important crystal chemical information.  We will
              study the effects of disorder on equations of state of isomorphs of mantle
              phases, including silicate spinels, Mg-Fe pyroxenes, Mg-Fe olivines, and Mg-Fe
              phase B, as well as Fe3+ and Al-bearing high-pressure phases, in order to
              quantify differences between isostructural and equilibrium equations of state. 
              We will continue our analysis of the dense, hydrous silicates, specifically the
              effect of adding Fe2+, Fe3+, Al, Ca, Na, and K to explore mineral compositions
              more relevant to mantle mineralogy.  Structural crystallography is undergoing a
              revolution initiated by the introduction of new x-ray diffractometers coupled
              with CCD detectors for three-dimensional recording of diffraction patterns.  A
              new Bruker diffractometer with a CCD detector purchased with support from NSF
              and the Keck Foundation, will enable us to measure full three-dimensional
              diffraction patterns of very small crystals, determine the nature of a range of
              defects affecting crystal properties, and collect data rapidly at a series of
              increasing/decreasing pressures and/or temperatures.  This and other equipment
              at the Geophysical Laboratory is available to investigators from other
              institutions who want to conduct crystallographic experiments, especially at
              high pressures and temperatures
