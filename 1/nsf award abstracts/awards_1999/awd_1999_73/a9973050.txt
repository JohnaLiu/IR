The proposed research addresses fundamental petrological
              questions regarding the interaction of magmas and aqueous fluids within the
              solid earth. The objectives are to characterize the solubility of water in
              silicate melts at pressures throughout the magma genetic regime and the
              speciation mechanisms as a function of pressure and temperature. These data are
              expected to place important new constraints on the interaction of silicate
              melts and aqueous fluids at magma genetic conditions and on those igneous
              processes that are affected by volatile solubility. Our approach consists of in
              situ visual observation and Raman spectroscopy of melt-fluid systems in the
              hydrothermal diamond anvil cell. Experiments will be performed in a new
              laboratory facility built by the P. I. With funds from the University of
              Michigan.  Visual observation of saturated melts in the diamond cell including
              measurement of the geometries of coexisting phases will be investigated as a
              method for quantifying phase equilibria in situ.  Investigation of the Raman
              spectrum of the liquid state will include careful and extensive comparison with
              suites of quenched glasses of known water content.  Pilot theoretical
              calculations of the Raman and IR spectra of model glass structures based on
              density functional theory will further assist in the assignment of Raman bands
              and will help reveal the connection between vibrational spectra and structure
              and bonding.
