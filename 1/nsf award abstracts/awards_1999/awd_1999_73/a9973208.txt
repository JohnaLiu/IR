     The investigator develops and analyzes
              stochastic
mathematical models of the actin-myosin molecular motor system,
in
              collaboration with David Warshaw and Kathleen Trybus,
experimental biologists
              at Vermont.  The actin-myosin system
occurs in the contractile mechanisms of
              muscle cells.  Model
mechanisms that incorporate the dynamics of
              actin-myosin
interaction are constructed based upon current
              biochemical,
structural and mechanical knowledge of the myosin motor
              protein
obtained from both optical trapping and in vitro motility
              assays.
Models are tested in the laboratory by the
              experimental
collaborators.  Once developed and validated, the models form
              the
basis for a description of the evolving complex
micro-interactions in the
              overall framework of muscular
contraction studies.  The models may also apply
              to other
molecular motors (e.g. kinesin, dynein, and RNA polymerase).
    
              The development of new experimental techniques, "optical
tweezers," permits
              new measurements of the very small forces
exerted in individual cells by
              molecular motors.  These motors
are the means by which cells effect movements.
               A basic mechanism
in contracting muscle cells is the actin-myosin molecular
              motor
system.  The investigator and his colleagues develop and
              analyze
stochastic models of this system, incorporating the new
              data
developed in recent experiments.  Models of this system will lead
to
              better understanding of a cell mechanism fundamental in
biotechnology.
