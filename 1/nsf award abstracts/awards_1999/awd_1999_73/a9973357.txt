The PI's propose to examine the
              influence of natural disturbances associated with beaver pond succession on
              spatial variation in the abundance of  a clonal fish lineage.  The PI's will
              address three broad objectives.  First, they will determine if disturbance
              regime associated with hydrological variability and beaver pond succession has
              created predictable patterns of clone abundance and dispersal.  Second, they
              will test the hypothesis that within beaver ponds, competitive interactions are
              weaker in areas where previous shifts in trophic morphology and resource use
              have occurred due to historically high clone abundance.  Third, they will
              experimentally evaluate the response of clonal and sexual fish to temperature
              and hypoxic stress associated with beaver pond succession.  These results will
              enhance our understanding of how geographic environmental differences influence
              the structure of fish communities and will provide insights into how
              disturbance and the introduction of clonal organisms in human dominated
              landscapes can impact aquatic vertebrates.
