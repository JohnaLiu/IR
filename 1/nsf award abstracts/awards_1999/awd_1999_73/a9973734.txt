Clarkia lingulata (Merced Clarkia) is an example of
              recent speciation from C. biloba ssp. australis (Mariposa Clarkia) and is often
              cited as a "classic" example of rapid speciation in plants.  However, beyond
              the original chromosomal description and a population level analysis that
              provides indirect evidence for the relationship between these species, there
              has been no further genetic characterization of these species.  The work
              proposed here will establish the specific chromosomal location of the genetic
              event and traits associated with the speciation of Clarkia lingulata from C.
              biloba ssp. australis.  The use of molecular methods unavailable at the time of
              the original species description will provide the basis for analyses
              specifically to identify those traits associated with the reproductive
              isolation of C. lingulata and C. biloba ssp. australis.  The information
              resulting from this research is important in understanding the importance of
              chromosomal change in adaptation and speciation.

The research builds on the
              existing knowledge of the principal investigator and expands her breadth in
              ecological genetics.  Funding from this POWRE award will enable the PI to
              pursue new questions in the study of speciation and hybridization between
              native and non-native invasive species.
