This POWRE award supports a focussed study in geomagnetism
              and paleomagnetism, which will constitute part of an integrated research
              program in these fields.  The proposed activities comprise the compilation and
              modeling of paleomagnetic data sets pertaining to global geomagnetic field
              behavior over the past 5 Myr.  While the gross properties of the 0-5 Myr
              geomagnetic field have been known for some time, the significance of departures
              from these first order characteristics- real field behavior versus limitations
              of data sets or modeling techniques- has remained elusive.  However, the
              details of field behavior reflected in the time-averaged structure, temporal or
              secular variations, and reversals are important as they may be intimately
              related to conditions at Earth's core-mantle boundary (CMB).  There is
              increased seismological evidence that strong lateral variations in the physical
              properties of the lower mantle near the CMB exist over a wide range of spatial
              scales.  Recent geodynamo simulations indicate that such heterogeneities may
              have profound influences on the dynamics of the outer core, and on geomagnetic
              observables at the Earth's surface.  The research will focus on involving
              undergraduate students, rather than graduate students in order to build a
              research program which could be continued as a faculty member at a primarily
              undergraduate institution, and in the short-term to strengthen ties between the
              research and graduate programs at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the
              UCSD undergraduate Earth science program.  This award would provide critical
              funding for the PI, after a significant absence from full-time academic
              research.
