Abstract    :
              This research is aimed at understanding the structures, spectroscopic
              properties, and redox behavior of Mo containing DMSOR (dimethylsulfoxide
              reductase) enzymes.   The approach will be to synthesize model compounds which
              contain Mo with an inner coordination sphere similar to that postulated for the
               natural enzymes from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and R. capsulatus, based on x-ray
              crystal structures.   The new compounds, of the type OMo(S2C2RR")2, will be
              characterized by a variety of techniques including cyclic voltammetry, NMR,
              FT-IR, UV-VIS, MS, ESEEM, EPR, PES, XPS, and CCD x-ray diffraction.

With
              this POWRE award, the Chemistry Division is supporting the work of Sharon N.
              Burgmayer in the Department of Chemistry at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, PA.
                The research is being done to understand behavior and spectroscopic
              properties of dimethylsuloxide reductase enzymes which contain molybdenum as
              the central metal.   Genetic malfunctions of molybdenum enzymes in humans are
              the cause of the fatal combined oxidase deficiency disease.   The work is
              expected to provide spectroscopic and structural benchmarks to aid in the
              interpretation of analogous data on the enzymes, and to provide insights into
              their active site chemistry.   It is also expected to provide excellent
              training for undergraduates at the interface between chemistry and
              biochemistry, and to motivate female students to go on to careers in
              research.
