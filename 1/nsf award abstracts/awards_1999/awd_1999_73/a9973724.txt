On September 1 through September 5, 1999,  the sixth
              biannual session of the conference "Mechanisms of Eucaryotic Transcription"
              will be held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  This  will be an open
              international meeting devoted to the most recent advances in the rapidly
              evolving field of eucaryotic transcription.  Attendance will be limited only by
              the available facilities, which can accommodate a  maximum of 425 participants.
               Oral presentations will be a combination of those invited and those selected
              from submitted abstracts.  This ensures the participation of junior and senior
              leaders in the field and the presentation of the most exciting results emerging
              at the time of the meeting.  The oral presentations will be complemented by
              poster presentations, also selected from submitted abstracts. The areas covered
              by the meeting include studies on 1) RNA polymerase, 2) global regulation, 3)
              chromatin remodelling and access to the template, 4) regulatory complexes, 5)
              gene-specific regulatory mechanisms, 6) activation mechanisms, 7) regulation of
              regulators, and 8) promoter clearance and elongation.  A number of eucaryotic
              systems including mammalian, Drosophila, nematode, and yeast will be
              represented.

The control of transcription is probably the most important
              step in the control of gene expression.  The understanding of how transcription
              is achieved and regulated is essential for understanding cell growth and
              differentiation, development, and cellular transformation.  This meeting will
              promote our understanding of this area by enabling its research community  to
              exchange and develop findings and ideas.
