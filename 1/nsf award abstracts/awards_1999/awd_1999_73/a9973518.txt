Transient dynamics of
              ecosystems

Ecological systems are subject to a wide variety of natural and
              anthropogenic perturbations.  For example, consider a lake.  On a short time
              scale, a rainstorm may temporarily increase the amount of nutrients in the
              lake, producing a brief algal bloom.  On a longer time scale, acid rain might
              produce a permanent shift in the lake's fauna, including the possibility of
              species extinctions. The reaction of an ecosystem to a perturbation can have
              important human health or economic consequences.  Ecologists and mathematicians
              have developed a theory to help them predict how ecosystems will respond to
              perturbations.  While this theory has been useful, it has two principle
              shortcomings.  First, its predictions are only expected to be correct a long
              time after the perturbation occurs.  Second, it assumes that before the
              perturbation the ecosystem was in equilibrium, i.e., it assumes that none of
              the ecosystem's components are changing over time.  The investigators on this
              project will develop a theory that corrects these two problems.  This theory
              will focus on the short-term responses of ecosystems to perturbations and will
              incorporate non-equilibrium systems.  The results of this study will be useful
              to ecosystem scientists working on a wide range of problems from conservation
              of biodiversity to global climate change, and in both terrestrial and aquatic
              systems.
