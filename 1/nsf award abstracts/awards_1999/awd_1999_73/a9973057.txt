Dr. Tedesco will produce an
              updated, standardized asteroid albedos - diameter database by using new data
              extracted from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) database and recently
              available observations obtained with the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX)
              satellite's infrared radiometer.  The larger sample provided by the database
              will lead to a better characterization of the properties of small main-belt
              asteroids and provide constraints for models of the origin and evolution of the
              asteroid belt.   The database will be made available to the community through
              published papers and inclusion in the Astrophysics Data Center's database and
              the Planetary Data Center's Small Bodies Node.
