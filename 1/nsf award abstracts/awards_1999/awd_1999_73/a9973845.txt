Discrete
              quantities of materials (nanoclusters), whether separated by grain boundaries,
              or by gas or liquid molecules have very interesting and potentially very useful
              material properties which may differ significantly from those of their bulk
              counterparts.  In this project, the growth of compound semiconductor
              nanoparticles from the gas-phase will be simulated assuming a
              collision/sintering mechanisms of particle growth.  Results from this work will
              be important for the design of larger scale processes for nanoparticle
              synthesis, and, more fundamentally, for increasing our understanding of
              phenomena occurring during particle formation.
