Abstract    :
              
9973545  Long  This is an award to support this investigator's shift in
              research focus from microbial aspects of groundwater, hazardous waste treatment
              and metabolism of aromatic organic substances toward microbiology of water with
              concentration on pathogen and indicator microbiology.  The investigator will
              devote a sabbatical year to working in the Department of Environmental Sciences
              and Engineering Environmental Microbiology Laboratory at the University of
              North Carolina in its School of Public Health.  The work will involve study of
              cell culture and molecular methods as potentially applied to potential use of
              coliphages as source-specific indicators of contamination of water by organisms
              of human fecal origin.  

This proposal was determined to be consistent with
              the objective of Program Announcement NSF 98-160, Professional Opportunities
              for Women in Research and Education (POWRE). In addition to merit review of the
              proposal in accord with the 1997 National Science Board criteria, consideration
              of the proposal leading to this award included review of the applicant's career
              objectives and their relevance to the proposed activity, impact of the award on
              her potential for academic advancement, and the relationship between the
              proposed activity, the research and educational environment of the
              institutional site for this work.  ***
