The goal of this POWRE proposal is to provide the
              opportunity for the PI to develop research training in organic materials and
              processes to compliment her work in nonlinear optical waveguides and to
              supervise more effectively her students from different home departments. In
              addition, a multidisciplinary research training program and graduate curriculum
              in organic nonlinear optics will be initiated through this effort. Current
              research involves fabricating waveguides using chromophore-doped polymers
              followed by electric field poling. A new effort is initiated to fabricate these
              waveguides by ionic self assembly. Planar waveguide structures have been grown
              by a modified technique developed by the PI's students. This approach will be
              used to design optical fiber devices for frequency conversion by creating a
              nonlinear cladding with ISAMs. To the knowledge of the PI, this idea has not
              been reported in the literature. The idea of producing a nonlinear fiber
              cladding rather than core has not been developed to any great extent. The PI
              knows of only one other attempt (in 1988) using Langmuir-Blodgett films. This
              project will be used as a means for the PI to develop relevant
              multidisciplinary research training in organic chemistry and materials science.
              This training will allow her to supervise her students more effectively and to
              develop a multidisciplinary graduate program involving Electrical Engineering,
              Physics, Chemistry, and Materials Science. A POWRE award would be important for
              revitalizing the PI's research program and extend it to new areas. The research
              program of the PI has been affected in recent years by significant personal
              events.
