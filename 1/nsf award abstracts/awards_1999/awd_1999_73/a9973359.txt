This POWRE grant will permit two significant changes in the
              PI's current career focus: (1) from administration and outreach to research,
              and (2) from a focus on igneous processes and ore deposits to sedimentary
              environments.  Almost ten years in administrative positions, beginning
              immediately after she received tenure, have taken their toll on research
              productivity.  Collaborations with Holly Stein and John Morgan on applications
              of Re-Os systematics to problems in igneous petrology and ore genesis have been
              her principal source of support and continuity.  Over the next two years, her
              service and administrative commitments will decline.  This proposed research
              would help her take advantage of an excellent convergence of resources -
              laboratory facilities, scientific expertise, and field collaborators - to
              initiate a promising new line of research.  Furthermore, the project will let
              her use her experience in high-temperature radiogenic isotope systematics and
              knowledge of geochemistry to open new arenas in geochronology and element
              transport in sedimentary environments.
