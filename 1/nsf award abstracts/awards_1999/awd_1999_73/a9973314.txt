Soil organic matter fractions and dynamics in experimental
              tropical ecosystems.

Land degradation in the tropics translates into lower
              agricultural productivity and increased poverty at the local level.  Loss of
              inherent soil fertility also has the potential to act at the global level to
              exacerbate climate change.  The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate
              biological mechanisms that regulate the rejuvenation of soil fertility in
              degraded soils.  The PI will investigate how and why soil organic matter
              dynamics are influenced by species composition and length of time between
              harvests in experimental forest plantations in Costa Rica.  She will develop
              laboratory methods for characterizing soil organic matter dynamics and
              interpret the results using a process-based modeling approach.  The broader
              objective is to increase our understanding of management impacts on key
              biological processes such that we can design more sustainable agroforestry
              systems.
