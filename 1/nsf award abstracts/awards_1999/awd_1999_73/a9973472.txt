	Phosphorus availability limits plant productivity
              throughout the tropics, including in most soils of South America's Amazon
              Basin.  There are some plants, such as the economically-important peach palm
              (Bactris gasipaes), that remain relatively productive in diagnostically P-poor
              soils, although the means by
which these plants may increase P-availabilty are
              little understood.  It has been suggested that such plants could be used to
              increase P-availability to other plants grown in the same system.  This project
              will identify and measure "less available" forms of P potentially used by some
              native Amazonian species, such as peach palm, growing in P-poor soils.  The
              study will also determine if peach palm, and other Amazonian trees, are adapted
              to utilize otherwise "unavailable" forms of soil P, by examining changes in
              soil chemistry around the roots of these plants.  The significance of using
              plants adapted to utilize less available forms of P to increase P availability
              to associated crop plants growing in P-deficient habitats will also be explored
              in field studies in the Brazilian Amazon.  The information gained from these
              studies will further our understanding of how some plants are able to
              accelerate P cycling in seemingly P-deficient conditions, and how they can be
              used to manage land more sustainably, since rapid soil  depletion is a major
              factor contributing to deforestation and land clearing in the tropics. 
              Conducting such research in collaboration with other institutions will help
              ensure that the results are applicable to a wider range of environments.
