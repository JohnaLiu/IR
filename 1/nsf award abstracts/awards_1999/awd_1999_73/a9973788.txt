Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) represent a fundamental
              shift in how transportation systems are designed and operated.  Benefits from
              ITS projects accrue at different geographic scales, yet no one model of traffic
              flow quality is able to assess these benefits at various scales. A model that
              is capable of quantifying the quality of traffic flow across scales of
              transportation systems will be beneficial in assessing the benefits and
              operations of ITS projects in terms of both localized and system-wide effects. 
              Such a scalable model has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of
              the processes governing traffic flow.  This project, which is supported under
              the POWRE Program, investigates the two-fluid model of town traffic, which is
              one model that appears to have scalable properties.  The scalability of this
              model will be investigated through a program of data collection and analysis
              that utilizes machine vision processing.  The research is expected to provide a
              novel model for traffic flow through signalized intersections. The analytical
              work related to the scalability of the two-fluid model and the experienced
              gained with machine vision processing will expand the research capabilities of
              the PI and will allow her to do future work related to the scalability of other
              traffic flow models.
