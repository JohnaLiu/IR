Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to fabricate polymer surfaces with micron and
              nanometer scale patterns for guided nerve regeneration from Schwann cells. The
              grooves will be produced on biodegradable poly- (lactic-co-glycolic acid)
              surfaces using photolithography for the micron scale grooves and atomic force
              microscopy for the nanopatterns. This proposal will enable the PI to broaden
              her research interests into cell/biomaterial interactions and facilitate the
              development of a course on biomaterials
