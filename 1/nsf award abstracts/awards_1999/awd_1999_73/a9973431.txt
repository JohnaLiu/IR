ABSTRACT

Professor Sara Larsen will focus this POWRE grant
              on the development of computational chemistry methods to study the effect of
              metal-zeolite structure on the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy
              parameters.  In particular, the g and A tensors in copper model complexes and
              copper-exchanged zeolites will be calculated using the Amsterdam Density
              Functional theory package.  The effect of structural distortion, binding of
              reactant molecules, and substitution of transition metals such as ruthenium and
              iron, will also be calculated.
