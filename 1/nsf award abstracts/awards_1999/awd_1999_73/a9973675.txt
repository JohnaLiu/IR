Abstract    :
              The research involves an extension of the computational methodology of
              correlation consistent basis sets of the type cc-pVnZ (n=D, T, Q, 5, 6) from
              small molecules, where it has been very successful in predicting structures and
              dissociation energies, to larger molecules of 10 to 15 atoms.   The approach
              will make use of the unique characteristics of the correlation consistent basis
              sets, reduce the basis sets while retaining computational accuracy, and focus
              on those properties where the errors are systematic for the molecules in a set,
              so that accurate relative quantities can be computed.

With this POWRE award
              the Chemistry Division supports the work of Angela K. Wilson in the Department
              of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Oklahoma in Norman,
              Oklahoma.   The proposed research will develop computational methods which will
              extend the accuracy of quantum mechanical calculations developed for molecules
              of two or three atoms to molecules with ten to fifteen.   Using modern
              high-speed computers, she will show how to predict the structures and energies
              of molecules of moderate size, which are of interest in modeling the chemical
              reactions involved  in the atmosphere or in combustion processes (e.g. in 
              internal combustion engines).
