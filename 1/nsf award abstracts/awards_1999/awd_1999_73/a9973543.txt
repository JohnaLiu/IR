Abstract    :
              This POWRE award supports a research project in Matrix theory.  The point of
              departure of the work is that, in the low energy limit, the amplitudes computed
              from the Matrix theory should agree with those computed from supergravity. All
              the perturbative tests have so far shown agreement, and the few
              nonrenormalization theorems proven to date extend the agreement beyond the
              perturbative level.  A better understanding of the existence of
              nonrenormalization theorems will clarify the correspondence between Matrix
              theory and supergravity for finite N.  This award gives the PI an opportunity
              to focus heavily on her research at a time when family responsibilities dictate
              that she either move forward with her work or forego a scientific career
              completely.  The award is funded by the NSF POWRE program, the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS Directorate, and  the Physics Division.
