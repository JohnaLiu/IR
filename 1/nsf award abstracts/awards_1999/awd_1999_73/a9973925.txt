Preliminary 14C measurements, coupled with
              ecosystem budgets, suggest that much of the organic C that enters the Hudson
              River was produced on land thousands of years ago and  that this material is
              metabolized during only a few months of riverine residence.  Thus, organic
              compounds that resisted decomposition for hundreds to thousands of years on
              land, may be fueling present-day metabolism upon entering the river.  If true
              and general, this phenomenon has implications for both riverine food webs, and
              for carbon storage and metabolism at the global scale.
	The Investigators
              propose to use 14C analyses to: 1) confirm these preliminary findings for the
              Hudson River; 2) infer the source of this ancient C by sampling some major
              Hudson tributaries which drain watersheds with different land uses; 3) expand
              their observations to several other rivers; and 4) examine key organisms in the
              Hudson to see if ancient C supports their growth.
