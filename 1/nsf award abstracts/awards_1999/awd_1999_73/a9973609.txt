Abstract    :
              Kelleher/POWRE:	The PI is interested in bringing a more quantitative analytical
              methodology to bear on the study of metabolic physiology and pathway
              engineering. In order to gain expertise in these methods, she proposes a
              sabbatical to study such quantitative techniques in the MIT laboratory of Prof.
              Gregory Stephanopoulos. POWRE provides the opportunity that would otherwise not
              be available because of her Research Professor status.
                The MIT
              collaboration will focus on three related areas. A nonlinear modeling method,
              Isotopomer Spectra Analysis, developed by the PI will be applied to mammalian
              cells. The Atom Mapping Technique developed by Prof. Stephanopoulos will be
              utilized to develop better tools for physiologists measuring total body
              gluconeogenesis. Finally, the concept of Network Rigidity also developed by Dr.
              Stephanopoulos will be applied for the first time to a hepatic cell model. It
              will be used to study a novel lipid synthesis pathway..
