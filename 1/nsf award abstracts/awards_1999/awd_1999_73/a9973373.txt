Abstract    :
                   The investigator develops efficient numerical methods
              for
multi-dimensional signal reconstruction using tools from
              harmonic
analysis such as local trigonometric transforms and wavelets.
The
              reconstruction problems that are considered range from
approximation of
              nonstationary signals from scattered data to
recovery of missing data in
              digital image sequences.  Successful
solution of these reconstruction problems
              requires a priori
information about the signal, otherwise these problems
              are
ill-posed.  Often this a priori knowledge can be derived from
physical
              properties of the process, for instance in terms of the
"local frequency
              behavior" of the signal.  Local trigonometric
transforms and wavelets have
              become powerful methods for
analysis, compression and denoising of digital
              signals.  The
investigator derives a mathematical framework for the
              application
of these concepts to signal and image reconstruction (beyond
              the
well-traversed area of denoising).  The design of these
reconstruction
              methods is accompanied by the development of
multi-level regularization
              techniques in order to provide a
flexible framework for the incorporation of
              different kinds of a
priori knowledge about the signal.  The investigator
              applies the
new numerical methods to the approximation of geophysical
              signals
from scattered data and to error correction in received coded
              bit
streams.
     This project is motivated by a number of
              multi-dimensional
signal reconstruction problems arising in areas as diverse
              as
exploration geophysics, medical imaging, and telecommunication.
In order
              to optimally compress, transmit or analyze an incomplete
or distorted signal,
              it is necessary to first reconstruct the
original signal from the available
              data.  This reconstruction
process includes the restoration of lost data as
              well as the
recovery of a signal from scattered noisy measurements. 
              The
mathematical framework being developed here allows the design of
flexible
              and robust algorithms for the reconstruction of
multi-dimensional signals. 
              Due to huge amount of data and
possibly required real-time processing the
              reconstruction
algorithms must also be fast and efficient.  The
              derived
numerical methods are important for reliable error correction in
data
              transmission, for efficient reconstruction of geophysical
signals, and for
              other applications.
