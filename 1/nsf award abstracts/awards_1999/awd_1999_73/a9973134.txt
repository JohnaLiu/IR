Abstract    :
              This work investigates distributed information processing over 
networks
              involving interference, noise, feedback and congestion. 

Also studied are
              distributed data compression, communication in networks,
distributed
              computation, and the role of feedback in communication networks.
Most of these
              problems are advanced by using an information theoretic point 
of view. The
              principal tools involve information theory, communication 
theory and quantum
              mechanics. 

The interesting role of quantum phenomena in communication is
              
investigated by studying the role of quantum entanglement 
in distributed
              communication and computation, as well 
as energy bounds for computation, the
              physics of quantum memory and a 
development of the understanding of the
              physics of information.
