Abstract    :
              The common underlying theme of all approaches to robustness is the construction
              of statistical procedures that perform well in the neighborhood of the assumed
              parametric model. In this context, the goodness of fit aspect of statistical
              modeling is no longer relevant.  Another problem with all these approaches is
              that statistical methods are developed for the location-scale models and are
              not easily extended to other types of models. 

I will explore the
              development of a robust theory in parametric estimation that addresses the
              above two problems and it is computationally easy to use. The new theory will
              address robustness problems that arise in the theory and application of mixture
              models, linear regression, logistic regression and generally in the application
              of generalized linear models. The basis for my approach is outlined in the
              joint papers by 
Markatou, Basu and Lindsay (1997, 1998) and the paper by
              Lindsay (1994).  The robustness of the new methodology will be studied via
              classical tools (such as breakdown) and via less traditional tools (such as
              
stability of the corresponding estimating equations).  This POWRE project is
              jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and
              the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
