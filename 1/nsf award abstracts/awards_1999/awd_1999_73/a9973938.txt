In spite of the importance of abiotic factors influencing
              community structure, little is known about how abiotic factors (such as solar
              radiation) and temperature may interact to modify community and ecosystem
              structure. This study will examine the effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR)
              on trophic interactions in zooplankton communities. Experiments are planned to
              investigate how exposure to different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation
              influence tropic interactions in zooplankton communities in the surface waters
              of oligotrophic lakes where predation, food limitations and high UVR are likely
              to be strong selective forces. A series of laboratory and field experiments
              will be used to manipulate the wavelengths of UVR to which organisms are
              exposed. Understanding how trophic interactions are modified in high UVR
              environments is essential to knowing how differences in the dynamics of pelagic
              communities in lakes that differ in their tropic status or UV transparency, as
              well as in their sensitivity to disturbance or changes in climate and
              atmospheric ozone levels. With impending changes in global climate and solar
              radiation regimes, these are central questions that need to be addressed.
