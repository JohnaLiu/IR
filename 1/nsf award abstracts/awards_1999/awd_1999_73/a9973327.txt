Abstract    :
              This proposal was submitted to the NSF-wide Professional Opportunities for Women
              in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The PI proposes to begin research on
              the sensory mechanisms coordinating chemoreception in spionid polychaetes, a
              common deposit-feeding invertebrate.  These worms are widely distributed in
              soft-sediment benthic marine environments and, along with other
              deposit-feeders, are responsible for the bioturbation that is important to this
              environment. Some evidence indicates that chemoreception may coordinate
              sediment ingestion rate and other aspects of deposit-feeding in a variety of
              species. The proposed research will attempt to identify some of the
              physiological and molecular mechanisms used by the worms to detect chemical
              stimuli.
