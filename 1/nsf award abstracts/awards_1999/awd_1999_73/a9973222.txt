The Tibetan Plateau is the largest region of high topography
              on earth, and is clearly related to the Himalayan collision between India and
              Asia.  Due to a limited understanding of the tectonic history of the region,
              Geodynamic models concerning the timing and nature of plateau uplift have been
              difficult to assess.  Existing models make predictions regarding the initial
              timing, rate, duration and spatial distribution of crustal thickening, however
              available data fails to provide unequivocal tests of these predictions.  One of
              the most serious absences from current data is a quantitative estimate of
              paleoaltitude through time that can be used to discriminated between models. 
              This project will attempt to take advantage of altitudional dependence of the
              oxygen isotopic makeup of precipitation by use of non-marine lacustrine
              carbonate-containing, Cenozoic basin deposits.  Many other factors affect the
              isotopic makeup of such deposits, but if a signal can be identified, it would
              provide key data about the uplift history of the Tibetan plateau that could
              refine and test models of Himalayan orogenesis.
