GaN and its alloys with A1N and InN are ideal semiconductor
              materials for photonic devices operating in the visible and UV regime of the
              spectrum and for high temperature, radiation hardened electronic devices.  As
              example, high reliability blue LEDs have applications in full-color flat panel
              displays, projection displays, traffic lights, and indicator lights.  Blue
              diode lasers are especially sought for digital compact disk storage
              applications.  GaN-based photodetectors are useful as solar blind UV detectors.
               GaN-based transistors will find applications in high temperature, radiation
              hard, and uncooled electronics, especially in avionics and spacecraft
              systems.

The reliability of current state-of-the-art GaN-based devices such
              as blue emitter and high temperature transistors is limited.  Blue diode laser
              lifetimes, for example, are only tens of hours.  This is widely attributed to
              the fact that most GaN devices are grown on lattice mismatched substrates such
              as sapphire which results in high dislocation densities: typically 1010
              cm-2.

We have demonstrated a technology to produce 10 x 10 mm2 single
              crystal GaN substrates with low dislocation densities (~106 to 107 cm-2) which
              when used to fabricate GaN lasers and transistors will enable a quantum leap in
              device reliability.  Laser lifetimes of 50,000 hours are now within
              reach.

It is proposed to produce large area (2 inch diameter) bulk single
              crystals of gallium nitride by utilizing the rapid growth rates afforded by
              hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) and growing on novel lattice-matched lithium
              gallium oxide (lithium gallate, LiGaO2) substrate.  A thin MOCVD-grown gallium
              nitride film will protect the oxide substrate from attack by HCI during HVPE. 
              A self-separation technique that leaves free-standing flat GaN without
              requiring mechanical or chemical treatment, has been demonstrated for small
              area samples and this technique will be advanced to larger area.
