The goal of this POWRE research is to examine the
              interaction between mss4, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and members of
              the SAP90 family of proteins. It is hypothesized that mss4 may control the
              binding of the kainate receptor to SAP90. Kainate binding to SAP90 may serve to
              localize the kainate receptor to the synaptic membrane and to influence its
              activity (it slows desensitization). Dr. Garcia presents preliminary results
              that mss4, obtained from a yeast two-hybrid screen, binds to SH3 and flanking
              regions of SAP90. Mss4 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor implicated in
              vesicle exocytosis. There are two specific aims, involving 1) analysis of the
              interaction between the two proteins, and 2) functional analysis of mss4
              function. The studies in aim 1 will further delineate the sites of interaction
              and determine if mss4 can bind to other SAP family members. Immunoprecipation
              experiments will try to determine the identity of protein complexes (under
              different detergent conditions) associated with mss4. The influence of the
              SAP90 binding site on the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of mss4 will be
              assessed by measuring the GDP dissociation rate from rab3a.
