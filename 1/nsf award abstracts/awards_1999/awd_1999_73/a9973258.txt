Abstract    :
                   The investigator studies the incorporation of local chemical
structure of
              DNA into a continuum rod model of the molecule.  In
several instances, this
              requires an extension of the basic
capabilities of the Cosserat rod model. 
              For example, numerically
efficient self-contact computations, and stability
              tests
associated with them, are required.  This represents an extension
of
              classic calculus of variations methods to the case when the
equilibrium
              Euler-Lagrange equations are integro-differential.
In addition, the
              investigator seeks an efficient incorporation of
localized DNA flexibility
              into the rod model, which requires
careful study of the interaction of this
              flexibility with the
rapid intrinsic twist of DNA.  These methods are applied
              to
specific DNA systems of biological interest, such as the
TATA-box, in
              collaboration with an experimental biochemist.
     Advances in experimental
              techniques and computational power
over the past decade have offered for the
              first time the
possibility of understanding the atomic-scale behavior of
              DNA.
At the same time, technology does not allow all-atom
              computer
simulations of DNA of realistic length; even if such
              simulations
were possible, they would in large part be wasteful, since
              they
would fail to take advantage of the highly constrained nature
              of
double-helical DNA.  The challenge facing DNA modelers is to
incorporate
              into simplified models this growing database of
atomic-scale information.  The
              projects pursued by the
investigator seek to bridge this gap, with techniques
              that
hopefully will be useful in a variety of other biochemical
systems.
