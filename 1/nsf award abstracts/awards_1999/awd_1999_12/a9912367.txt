Abstract    :
              This project will analyze the geochemistry of sediment porewaters in cores taken
              from the flank of the East Pacific Rise.  Geochemical gradients derived from
              the cores will be combined with measures of heat flow, physical properties and
              seismic mapping to e collected by German colleagues, and the data used to (1)
              calculate vertical velocity of porewater flow; (2) determine the composition of
              seawater in the underlying basalt; (3) constrain the mechanisms by which
              seawater flows into basement and (4) provide data to constrain conceptual and
              numerical models of subsurface circulation.
