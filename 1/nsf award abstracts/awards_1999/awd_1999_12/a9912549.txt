This two-year award supports U.S.-France-Sweden cooperative
              research on the design, fabrication and testing of ultrasonic microscope lens
              sensors and smart materials embedded with sensors.  The principal investigators
              are Tribikram Kundu of the University of Arizona, Dominique Placko, S.P. Faure
              of the Ecole Normal Superieure de Cachan, France, and K. Hjort of Uppsala
              University in Sweden.  In addition to the three major partners, researchers at
              ONERA, France and the University of Aarhus, Denmark will contribute towards the
              collaborative research.  The principal objective is to develop new acoustic
              sensors using Lamb waves. Acoustic microscope lens sensors are used to detect
              internal defects in multilayered materials in microelectronic devices and in
              airplane structural components. Microscope lamb wave sensors have potential to
              scan the full depth of a specimen and detect damages in different layers in a
              multilayered solid.  A second objective is to conduct research on sensors for
              smart structures. 

The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration
              expertise on the basic mechanical design of sensors based on ultrasonic
              modeling.  This is complemented by the micro-machining expertise at Uppsala
              University, access to unique facilities for testing and fabricating lenses and
              smart structures at ENS Cachan.  The project will advance understanding of Lamb
              wave lens design for acoustic microscopy and could produce a new ultrasonic
              sensor.
