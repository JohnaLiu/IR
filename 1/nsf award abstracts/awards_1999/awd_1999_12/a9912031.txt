The status of research on sex and gender
              difference is of strong interest to federal agencies and to the private sector
              which have expanded their research portfolios to include an enlarging focus on
              women's health.  Understanding the biological basis of sex and gender
              differences is of increasing importance in the design and conduct of basic,
              translational and clinical research and throughout the continum of personal and
              societal development and healthcare.  Defining differences between males and
              females extends beyond primary and secondary sexual  characteristics and
              encompasses characterizing the biological, psychosocial and pharmacological
              functions of males and females across the lifespan.
