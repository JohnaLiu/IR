This award provides funding to initiate an internship
              program in marine science at the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) and
              at Jackson State University (JSU). The PI will collaborate with Dr. Paulinus
              Chigbu at JSU to develop the site. Dr. Chigbu will coordinate student
              recruitment of upper-level undergraduate students and will make special efforts
              to recruit minority students. The USM will conduct a summer REU session for up
              to eight students for a total of ten weeks at the Gulf Coast Research
              Laboratory in Ocean Springs, MS. Three internships will also be available at
              JSU located in Jackson, MS during the Fall semester. Students who participate
              in the program will receive full financial support, including stipends, and
              will earn college credit. Cost-sharing is provided by USM and JSU.
