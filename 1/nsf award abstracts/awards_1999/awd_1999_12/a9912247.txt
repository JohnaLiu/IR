Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates:  Robot Navigation using Composite Landmarks
                  
                                     
  These research projects draw from the areas of
              robotics, behavior learning and cognitive science within an environment of
              robot navigation. The PIs use small robotic  vehicles to test their algorithms
              and model the behavior of the desert ant, Cataglyphis Bicolor. This ant uses
              landmarks consisting of more than one  point (composite) as opposed to simple
              point landmarks. Examples of  composite landmarks in  everyday environment are
              ridgelines, saddle points  and peak formations.   Projects focus on 
              development  and testing of  algorithms for recognizing composite landmarks,
              development of  learning algorithms to map sensory input to motor output, and
              comparing the use of composite versus simple landmarks. The projects  include
              building Lego test vehicles, writing simulations and implementation of image
              processing techniques. The program has an emphasis on technical writing and
              speaking skills.
