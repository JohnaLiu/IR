Abstract    :
              The REU program at Ohio State University offers to undergraduate students the
              opportunity to research in a wide range of physics research  and astrophysics. 
              Each student will work on a well-defined research project under the direction
              of a faculty mentor.  Several tutorial programs are offered in computational
              physics, Tex and Latex, electronics, etc.  The program is intended for juniors
              entering their senior year as a physics major and students from smaller physics
              programs are emphasized.  At the end of the program each student will write a
              research report and give an oral presentation.  Seminars, field trips, social
              activities, and sports are planned.
