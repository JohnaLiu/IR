Abstract    :
              
The Carnegie-Rochester Conference on Public Policy is designed to foster
              research and discussion of major policy issues by economists from academia and
              various policymaking organizations. Economists in universities are often
              unfamiliar with the constraining effect of institutional arrangements in the
              shaping of policy issues whereas economists in government are often less aware
              of current research developments and their implications. The principal
              objectives of the conference series are (i) to stimulate policy relevance in
              theoretical and empirical research in economic sciences, (ii) to encourage
              interchange of scientific ideas among analysts with different approaches, and
              (iii) to generate greater understanding by academic economists of
              practitioners' environments. The proposal will argue that the conferences have
              been outstandingly productive along these lines in the past and it will outline
              recent adjustments in procedures that have been designed to assure that they
              will continue to be productive in the future. The conferences are held
              semi-annually at the University of Rochester and Carnegie Mellon University.
              About 50 participants plus faculty and graduate students from the host
              institution are invited to each conference. Participants from U.S. and foreign
              central banks and U.S. and international agencies attend regularly, and special
              care is taken to involve promising young scholars. The papers are formal
              discussions and are edited and published so as to broaden the impact of the
              conference.
