Abstract    :
              The planning project permits the Principal Investigator to participate in
              activities for developing a competitive research project in programming
              languages. In particular, the Principal Investigator participates in national
              and international conferences to learn about results from new research in
              
theoretical and applied aspects of programming languages. The Principle
              Investigator is using this knowledge to conduct preliminary research for
              determining the effectiveness of using domain-specific languages for program
              interoperability. Program interoperability allows one program to use the
              services of another program automatically. The preliminary research focuses on
              developing the formal semantics of a meta-language for domain-specific
              languages and implementing a prototype of a software tool for rapidly
              developing interpreters of domain-specific languages.
