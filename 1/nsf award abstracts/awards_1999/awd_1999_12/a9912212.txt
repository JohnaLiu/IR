Abstract    :
              The REU program at Michigan State University offers to undergraduate students
              the opportunity to do fore-front research in a field of physics-nuclear,
              condensed matter, high-energy, or astrophysics.  Each student will work on a
              well-defined research project under the direction of a faculty mentor.  A wide
              variety of projects is available, both experimental and theoretical.  In
              nuclear physics, MSU is the site of the National Superconducting Cyclotron
              Laboratory.  Condensed matter physics includes basic solid-state physics and
              properties of new materials.  REU projects in high-energy physics are done at
              MSU, relating to experiments at Fermilab and CERN.  For astrophysics, there is
              a 24" reflecting telescope at MSU, and data from other observatories.  At the
              end of the program each student will write a research report and give an oral
              presentation.  Seminars, field trips, social activities, and sports are
              planned.
