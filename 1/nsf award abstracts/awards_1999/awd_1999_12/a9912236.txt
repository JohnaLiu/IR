This award provides renewed funding for a summer internship
              program at University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO).
              This program has been active since 1986 and is called the Summer Undergraduate
              Research Fellowships in Oceanography (SURFO). NSF OCE has funded the program
              since 1989. The program aims to expose students who are majoring in math and
              physics to ocean sciences and seeks to provide students with a one-on-one
              research instruction from a faculty mentor.  The program specifically recruits
              from members of the Physics Honor Society. The program provides internships for
              eight students to conduct eleven weeks of research each summer. At the end of
              the summer, students prepare a 30-minute presentation on their research.  This
              program contains substantial cost-sharing by the University.
