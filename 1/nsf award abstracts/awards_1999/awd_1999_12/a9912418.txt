Abstract    :
              In all graph algorithms, graphs are encoded by binary strings.
The problem of
              encoding graphs by binary strings is a fundamental
problem in computer
              science. To be useful in graph algorithms,
an encoding of a graph G should be
              as short as possible and
support various graph queries and operations. The
              well known
adjacency-matrix and adjacency-lists representations are used
              by
virtually all existing graph algorithms. However, they do not satisfy
all
              of these requirements. New graph encoding schemes satisfying all
of these
              requirements for various graph families will be developed.
Once such an
              encoding scheme for a graph family is found, it will be
possible to improve
              and/or simplify existing algorithms for solving
problems on this graph family.
              In addition to graph algorithms, the
short encoding of plane triangulations
              (i.e. triangular meshes) has
important applications in Computer Graphics.

A
              planar graph may have many plane embeddings. For some applications,
it is
              often required to find an embedding such that certain properties
are
              satisfied. These problems arise from areas such as VLSI design,
Geographic
              Information Systems, and some graph optimization problems.
Existing algorithms
              for solving these problems rely on dynamic
programming and are not efficient.
              In this research project we will
develop more efficient algorithms and explore
              their applications.

A common technique is used in several recent algorithms
              for solving
graph drawing and floor-planning problems: Labeling vertices or
              edges
of a graph so that certain regular properties are satisfied;
              then
solving the problems by using the combinatorial structures
              resulting
from the labeling. We will extend this technique and use it to
              solve
other problems in these fields.
