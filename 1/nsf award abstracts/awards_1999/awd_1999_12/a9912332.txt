This
              Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site provides an opportunity for
              U.S. urban students to participate in laboratory and field research in
              international, interdisciplinary northern science. The project incorporates
              hands-on work in zooarchaeology and historical ecology through an
              archaeological field school in northern Iceland. The City University of New
              York's Northern Science and Education Center, based at Brooklyn College, will
              have primary oversight, review, and administration responsibilities, while
              other participating institutions include the Hunter College Bioarchaeology
              Laboratory and Anthropology Department, the Brooklyn Archaeological Institute,
              the Brooklyn Bioarchaeological Laboratory, the Graduate Center of the City
              University, the Stefansson Arctic Center, the Archaeological Institute of
              Iceland, the Myvatn Science and Conservation Center, and the Geography
              Department of the University of Edinburgh. Fieldwork will center on the lake
              Myvatn area of northern Iceland, where a cooperative field school has been held
              since 1996.
