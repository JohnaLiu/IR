Abstract    :
              Award is for measuring He, Ne, and Ar noble gases and CO2 content on
              step-crushed basaltie quench glasses from the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR) to
              examine how noble gases fractionate in the mantle, knowledge essential to
              understanding mantle melt extraction and volatile transport.  This work will
              also examine heterogeneity in mantle 40 Ar/36 Ar, possibly arising from
              suduction of atmospheric Ar, and will also investigte the so-called He-paradox,
              wherey melt samples whose parental material originated from deep within the
              earth (characterized by high 3He/4He and associated with mantle plumes) have
              low He abundances, as well as the He flux seemingly having little to do with
              heat flux from the mantle (as represented by magma production).  Samples from
              the Southeast Indian Ridge have been chosen for the study  as they show smooth
              variation in composition away from the Amsterdam-St. Paul mantle plume that
              coincides with changes in ridge axial depth.  These samples therefore represent
              a unique sample set to examine the influene on sub-oceanic mantle noble gas
              systematics by a deep mantle plume acting on the mantle processes underneath a
              spreading ridge.
