This nine-month project has been awarded for the purpose of
              partially supporting a conference in the social sciences at Woods Hole on June
              22-25, 2000.  The conference purposes are to disseminate current knowledge and
              trends in the social sciences to teacher educators, curriculum and staff
              development specialists, and publishers.  In addition a second purpose is to
              inform efforts to reform and revitalize the teaching and learning of the social
              sciences in U.S. schools.  These discussions will be based upon the current
              literature and experiences of the attendees.   The conference will cover the
              areas of political science, economics, and the behavioral sciences.  The
              participants will be approximately 60 in number.  Special consideration is
              given to include younger scholars in these areas.  There will be a publication
              in the form of a CD-ROM for others to have access to the conclusions reached by
              the conference.
