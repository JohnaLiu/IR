Abstract    :
              This award is for NSF co-sponsorship of an international workshop with the
              European Science Foundation (ESF) and the International Institute for Applied
              Systems Analysis (IIASA). The workshop will be held December 3-5, 1999 in
              Laxenburg, Austria. The objectives of the workshop are threefold: First, it
              will identify the main critical issues within this broad area and delineate the
              interrelationships among them; second, it will take stock of the present state
              of knowledge and of ongoing research concerning collaboration technologies and
              factors affecting their deployment and use; and third, it will provide a forum
              for discussion about further research on the co-evolution of technological,
              institutional and organizational infrastructures affecting the conduct of
              collaborative science on a global scale.  Three substantive themes will be
              addressed: 1) how to characterize the technological opportunities encapsulated
              by the concept of a virtual laboratory; 2) the practical issues involved in
              organizing and conducting scientific work at a distance; and 3) the interaction
              between intellectual property issues and access to virtual libraries and data
              archives.  NSF sponsorship will enable the participation of non-European
              experts in this workshop by funding US and Russia participants' travel to
              Europe. It will also enable the workshop organizers to commission revised and
              expanded papers for a post-workshop publication.
