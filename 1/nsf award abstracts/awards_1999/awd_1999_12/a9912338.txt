Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to solve algorithmic problems from
              application
areas by visualizing the problem data in terms of a related
              geometric
space, using this visualization to develop an improved
              mathematical
understanding of these problems, and combining this understanding
              with the
techniques of computational geometry to develop efficient algorithms
              for
the problems.  Particular problem domains targeted by this project
              include
(1) generation of unstructured quadrilateral and cuboid meshes for
              the
finite element method; (2) robust methods for fitting hyperplanes or
              other
geometric shapes to sets of data points; and (3) adaptive user
              interface
problems, for example tuning the relative weights of parameters such
              as
distance, travel time, or scenic value in a vehicle routing system, to
              make
it produce routes that more closely match driver preferences.  All of
              these
areas relate to fundamental geometric problems of partitioning spaces
              by
arrangements of curves or surfaces.  A further connecting theme in
              the
proposed research is the use of topological methods to separate
              global
shape properties from local geometric attributes, and to provide a
              precise
language for discussing these properties.  The investigator will apply
              a
conscious focus on computational topology to accelerate progress
              in
geometric computing.
