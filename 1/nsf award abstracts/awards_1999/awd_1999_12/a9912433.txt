This award to University of Washington will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/Vs Thompson and Barnes,
              research vessels operated by the university's School of Oceanography as part of
              the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.
              Specific instrumentation to be acquired includes a pair of replacement fume
              hoods to be used in the isotope vans, and three transmissometers for study of
              light scattering in the water column.  The shared-use instrumentation supported
              here will assist marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in  the
              northeast Pacific, but also elsewhere in the world oceans, during 2000 and
              future years.
