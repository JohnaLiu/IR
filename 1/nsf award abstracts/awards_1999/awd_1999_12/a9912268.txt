Abstract    :
              The University of North Texas Institute of Anthropology will provide summer
              research experiences for junior college and University of North Texas minority
              and non-minority students who will be rising sophomores and juniors.  The
              program will take place over ten weeks, with the first five weeks consisting of
              instruction on anthropological research techniques and the second five weeks
              consisting of research experience.  The students will be trained in four major
              research areas in anthropology, historical and testimonios case studies,
              participant observation, conducting focus group studies, and data analysis on
              text-interview material.  In addition, students will be taught the techniques
              for conducting resource material location, library research, and the use of the
              Internet for research purposes.  Through the ten-week program, students will be
              exposed to such topics as writing research results, stages of research,
              critical thinking, note taking during research, getting published, and
              presenting at conferences.  All students will be followed to determine their
              college progress and to encourage their participation in the Undergraduate
              Scholars Program called McNair.  The McNair Program allows students to work
              closely with a mentor at the University of North Texas over a one- or two-year
              period.  This project will feed students into the McNair Scholars program.
