Abstract    :
              The satisfactory performance of wood-framed housing in a seismic or wind event
              requires a sufficiently strong, ductile, and energy-absorbing lateral
              force-resisting system. This project will focus on the development of optimized
              synthetic fiber-reinforced OSB panels to improve the disaster resistance of
              conventional wood-frame construction. The project research will employ response
              simulation, small-scale connection and durability testing, and full-scale shear
              wall testing. Various fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) systems will be
              investigated for reinforcing the OSB panels. Shear tests of individual nailed
              connections between FRP-reinforced and plain OSB panels and lumber framing will
              be conducted to determine monotonic and cyclic fastener load-slip
              relationships. In addition, full-scale monotonic and static structural tests of
              shear walls made with both FRP-reinforced and unreinforced OSB panels will be
              conducted to quantify the strength and ductility benefits achieved through
              selective panel reinforcement. We expect that the new fiber-reinforced OSB
              panels will be stonger, more ductile, and less sensitive to construction errors
              than conventional OSB or plywood.
