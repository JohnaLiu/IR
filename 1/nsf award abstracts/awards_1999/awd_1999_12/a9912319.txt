Faculty from the School of Engineering and Environmental
              Science (CEES) at the University of Oklahoma has  established an 8-week summer
              REU Site centered around the disciplines of geo-environmnetal engineering and
              science.  The objective is to immerse 12 students per year in advanced research
              topics by providing them with meaningful projects that span all major steps of
              scientific inquiry:  formulate questions, develop hypothesis, conduct
              literature reviews, set-up an experimental matrix, analyze and synthesize
              results, and prepare final reports (oral and written).  Activities extend
              beyond the laboratory or field site, where REU students are members of a
              faculty/graduate student research tema, to include orientation seminars,
              hazardous waste and safety training, Friday luncheous devoted to research
              issues, pratice presenations and ethics, field trips to research facilities,
              and social functions.  The vision of this REU Site is to creat an engaging
              atmosphere to motivate amd prepare undergraduate students to pursue advanced
              degrees in the critical areas of geo-environmental engineering and science. 
              Such scientists and engineers are needed in consulting and industry in order to
              be good steweards of the natural and man-made environments, and they are needed
              in research labs and academia to further our understanding of geo-environmental
              systems.
