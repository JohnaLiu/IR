US Japan collaborative research effort will be made here to
              focus on minimizing damage caused by a strong motion earthquake to continuous
              girder bridges.  Investigations will center on acquisition of a
              magnetorheological (MR) damper, development o a robot neural-fuzzy control
              algorithm, experimental full-scale implementation, and damage of a bearing
              system during testing.  The goal is to demonstrate control of vibrations
              through supplemental damping in a subcomponent of a major constructed facility.
               Success of magnetorheological damper technology is imminent and needs multiple
              large-scale experiments for verification of the approach to amelioration of
              damaging effects of earthquakes.

A magnetorheological damper will be
              constructed at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, USA.  This
              portion of the research team will also establish a neural network
              representation of the behavior of the damper.  Concurrently, a neural-fuzzy
              algorithm will be developed jointly by The University of Tokyo and Texas A&M
              University for control of the MR dampers during seismic excitation.  Finally,
              the dampers will be installed in a full-scale dynamic test of a bridge bearing
              that has simultaneous motion in its two in-plane directions.  Successful
              demonstration of this technology is intended to encourage governmental agencies
              that construct and maintain continuous girder bridges in urban areas to
              consider using MR dampers as supplemental damping devices in new and retrofit
              bridge designs.

This project is supported under the 3rd-year competition
              under NSF 98-36. "US Japan Cooperative Research in Urban Earthquake Disaster
              Mitigation."
