Abstract    :
              The University of South Carolina Summer Research Institute in Experimental
              Psychology has provided and will continue to provide a mechanism for educating
              undergraduate students about the field of experimental psychology.  Many
              students, including students from underrepresented minorities, are drawn to
              applied psychology programs.  The intent of the Institute, in contrast, is to
              focus student interest and enthusiasm on the basic science areas of psychology.
               The eight-week USC Summer Research Institute will permit well-qualified
              minority and non-minority undergraduate students majoring in a behavioral
              science an experience in graduate-level research, including an opportunity to
              formulate and conduct an experiment with individual guidance from an energetic
              and supportive research faculty mentor.  The student will participate in major
              phases of experimental research, including literature review, hypothesis
              generation, data collection, data organization, statistical analysis and report
              writing in the style of American Psychological Association journals.  Student
              experiences will be enriched by weekly research seminars, in which assigned
              readings will be discussed, and by weekly sessions on problems of research
              design and statistics in experimental psychology.  Students will receive gratis
              course credit for their work.  This program emphasis is much needed, as the
              U.S. is perceived to be the leader in the field of experimental psychology, and
              our universities must be able to motivate and train the best students for
              future careers in vital areas of behavioral science.  This Summer Institute
              will continue to provide one vehicle to enhance these goals.
