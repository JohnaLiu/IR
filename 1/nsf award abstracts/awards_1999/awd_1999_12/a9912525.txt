The main objective of this research is to develop a
              framework for balancing bridge system reliability and expected life-cycle cost
              of bridge maintenance programs.  This framework will provide the methodology
              for optimum bridge maintenance based on system reliability in a cycle
              perspective.  The challenge in using the proposed framework is quantifying the
              uncertainties in the input variables.  The information from bridge performance
              data, maintenance data, cost data, and engineering judgement can be combined,
              used, systematically updated and related directly to the optimum solution.  The
              proposed approach will permit the process of optimum lifetime planning of
              bridge maintenance programs to evolve rationally and to be cost-effective.
