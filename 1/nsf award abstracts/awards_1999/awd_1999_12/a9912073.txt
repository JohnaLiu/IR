Abstract    :
              This project is a study of electrification processes in thunderstorms using
              observations of the structure and temporal evolution of lightning flashes in
              different types of storms, including electrically anomalous storms in which the
              electrification and lightning are of inverted polarity.  The flashes are
              observed using a deployable, GPS-based, three-dimensional mapping system
              developed under a previous NSF grant.  The time of arrival of the same
              lightning event is measured with great precision at as many of ten stations
              over a network of approximately 100 km on the side.  From this information, the
              time history of the flash in three dimensions can be inferred with temporal and
              spatial accuracy that exceeds any observations previously available.  The
              network will be deployed in the summer of 2000 as part of the STEPS program
              (Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study) in eastern
              Kansas.  Data will be compared with radar observations of overall storm
              structure and in-situ measurements of the electric field by aircraft and
              balloons, to provide a comprehensive description of the electrical
              characteristics of thunderstorms.  Results are expected to be significant not
              only for understanding electrification processes but also in the use of
              lightning as an indicator of storm type and intensity.
