Abstract    :
              The mainstream approach to improving the quality of IC testing is to develop
              better tests that target more realistic failure mechanisms.  This project is
              investigating an orthogonal approach that promises significant improvements in
              the effectiveness of any given testing procedure by employing wafer based
              spatial test information as additional input in interpreting test results. 
              This spatial information is useful in making the best possible judgement about
              circuit quality because of the widely observed clustering of defects on
              semiconductor wafers, and the fact that circuit parameters track closely for
              adjacent dice on the same wafer.  Early results indicate the potential for
              defect level improvements up to an order of magnitude in screening for high
              quality circuits, and the possibility of screening out potential early-life
              failures, without expensive burn-in tests.  On-going research aims at
              validating these findings on new, more voluminous, industrial test data, and
              also developing analytical models to estimate the test quality improvements. 
              The new approach is also being investigated for developing neighborhood-based
              thresholds for optimally interpreting test results in non-Boolean test
              approaches, such as IDDQ and very low voltage testing.
