Abstract:

Concepts and techniques borrowed from combinatorial and
              algebraic topology have proved to be effective tools of for analyzing
              distributed and concurrent computation.  This approach has yielded a variety of
              accomplishments, including new results and better formulations of earlier
              results.  The research program described here is extending this work in tow
              directions.  First, it focuses on reformulation classical notions from
              algebraic and combinatorial topology into a more combinatorial form
              better-suited to modeling computation.  These notions can simplify and unify
              the analysis of a variety of computational modes.  A second, complementary
              focus is on exploiting algebraic invariants uncovered by topological methods to
              classify the computational power of various synchronization primitives.
