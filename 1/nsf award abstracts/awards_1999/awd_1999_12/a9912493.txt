Abstract    :
              The Department of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has an
              established record of providing research opportunities for its own
              undergraduates and successfully administered summer programs for students from
              underrepresented populations in 1998 and 1999.  The Department has an
              internationally recognized research faculty committed to undergraduate and
              graduate education and eager to direct individual research projects.  For the
              next three summers, 2000-2002, the Department will offer the Psychology
              Research Experience Program (PREP), a summer program to provide research
              experiences that will help to prepare undergraduate students from
              underrepresented populations for graduate school.  In addition to support from
              the National Science Foundation, additional support will come from the
              University's Graduate School.

The main goal of PREP is to attract motivated
              students who will pursue an academic research career.  PREP will provide the
              opportunity for eight-ten students in each of the three summers to gain
              hands-on experience with faculty mentors in research laboratories.  The
              eight-week program will foster learning of research techniques in laboratory
              groups of faculty, graduate, and undergraduate participants.  The PREP
              undergraduates will come from the University of Wisconsin-Madison as well as
              from other institutions.  In every case, however, they will be from an
              underrepresented minority population, from a low-income background, and/or be
              from the first generation in their family to attend college.

The entire
              process of research, from literature search through collection and analysis of
              data, will culminate in an oral and written presentation and, if appropriate,
              journal publication.  In addition, faculty members will discuss various
              research areas in psychology in weekly lunch seminars, thus highlighting the
              diverse nature of the discipline.
