Local numerical methods, based on Monte Carlo
              simulations,  directly
deliver the value of an unknown function at a point
              inside a domain without
the need for calculating its value at any other point.
              No meshing is
required, no linear equation systems need to be solved and the
              method is
very easy to code and parallelize. This class of methods includes
              the
Random Walk Method (RWM), the Walk on Spheres Method (WSM) and 
the
              Boundary Walk Method (BWM).  Local methods will be developed in 
this project
              to solve linear elasticity problems, and then for homogenization 
problems and
              problems with random boundaries.
