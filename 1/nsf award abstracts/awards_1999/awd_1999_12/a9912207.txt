Abstract    :
              Princeton University continues providing opportunities for undergraduate
              research through a multidisciplinary Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site. The REU Site is hosted by the Princeton Materials Institute (PMI). 
              Ten undergraduate students are recruited every year for a nine-week summer
              research experience, with a student recruitment focus on underrepresented
              minorities and students from colleges where research experiences are limited. 
              The students participate in a variety of materials research projects under the
              direction of faculty from science and engineering departments that are
              associated with PMI.  In addition, REU participants attend short courses in
              materials science concepts and visit local industrial laboratories.
