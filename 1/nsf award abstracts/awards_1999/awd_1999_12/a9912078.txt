"Exploring the Role of Science in K-8 Literacy Education" is a
              five-year project that will produce a series of conferences, books, a CD-ROM
              and a web site that will address the issue of reading and writing within the
              context of science instruction for young students.  The project is designed to
              highlight meaningful, salient and useful connections between inquiry-based
              science teaching and literacy instruction.  The project will develop, organize
              and share information from both the science and literacy communities on
              connections between and among hands-on activity, text-based information
              resources, student cognition and teacher practices.  The project will also
              provide science educators with resources they can use to increase attention to
              science at both the local and national level.  It will disseminate information
              about when, how and under what circumstances science and literacy connections
              should be fostered.  Activities will include a series of conferences that
              address the concerns of various stakeholders in both the science and language
              arts communities.  By promoting those inquiry strategies advocated by science
              educators that can improve children's reading, writing, speaking, listening and
              thinking skills, the role of science instruction at the elementary school level
              will be reinforced and enhanced.
