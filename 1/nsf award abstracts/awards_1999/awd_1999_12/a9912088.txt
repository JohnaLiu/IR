Abstract    :
              Recently, the potential for subtle but serious chronic/sublethal impacts from
              dino-flagellates known as the toxic Pfiesteria complex on fish health as well
              as human health was realized during toxic outbreaks in several tributaries of
              the largest estuary on the U.S. mainland, in the second largest estuary, the
              Albemarle-Pamlico, for nearly a decade before the Chesapeake outbreaks.  In
              this research we will mass-produce toxic culture of P. piscicida in a
              custom-designed biohazard III facility for research on toxic stages.  This
              facility will be required for maintenance of toxic stages of Pfiesteria
              piscicida and the second known toxic Pfiesteria-like species, and for all
              experiments to determine the range of stage transformations among toxic stages
              of each species.  This will involve cloning toxic and nontoxic isolates of
              Pfiesteria piscicida, and of the second known toxic Pfiesteria-like species,
              from the Neuse and Pocomoke Estuaries at 8- to 12-month intervals (needed since
              cultures that are maintained in toxic mode with live fish for longer periods
              tend to lose virulence).  This research will greatly improve recognition of
              Pfiesteria in field samples from fish kills/epizootics, and will also enhance
              general understanding of trophic controls on stage transformations and
              abundance of both known species in the toxic Pfiesteria complex.
