This study proposes a new methodology to reconstruct
              past changes in C3 vs C4 grass distributions by carbon isotopic analysis of
              fossil grass and pollen extracted from sediment cores.  The advantage of this
              methodology is that C3 and C4 plants are easily distinguished by their carbon
              isotopic signatures, and grass pollen faithfully records the carbon isotopic
              signature of the host plant.  Therefore, past shifts C3 vs. C4 plants will be
              recorded by the grass pollen isotopic record.  As shifts recorded by the grass
              pollen will be used in conjunction with ice core estimates of pCO2 to provide
              moisture-independent, constrained estimates of LGM continental temperature
              change in the tropics.  The work plan includes analysis of pollen from
              identified modern grasses from tropical East Africa to test mew methodologies
              and confirm integrity of the grass pollen carbon isotopic signal.  Analysis of
              surface sediment samples from four lakes in western Uganda in conjunction with
              semi-quantitative estimates of grass species abundance in the lowland
              environments contributing pollen to these basins will provide necessary modem
              analogs for comparison with fossil values.  Impacts of past climate change on
              the grassland communities will be assessed through analysis of grass pollen
              preserved in Last Glacial sediment samples from a core collected in at least
              one crater lake.  Results of the proposed research will refine estimates of
              tropical East African cooling during the LGM and will contribute to global
              carbon budget estimates by providing paleoecological data to improve model
              predictions of change in terrestrial carbon reservoirs from the LGM to present
              day.
