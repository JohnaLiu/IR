Transatlantic Governance:  Urban Women and Law in Havana,
              Cuba,
1837-1889

This dissertation project is a study of transatlantic legal
              administration.  It examines
the period 1837-1889, during which Spanish
              colonial Cuba was governed by
what were called "special laws." The project
              examines the impact of these laws on women. The relevant data are the colonial
              statutes and municipal ordinances that regulated the daily life of Havana's
              population. Occupational, criminal, and family regulations are considered.  The
              hypothesis critically examined is the prevailing interpretation that law
              limited the participation of women in economic and social life. These data
              provide the strongest data on women's involvement in commercial and juridical
              matters. Criminal cases and police records will also be reviewed because they
              offer valuable quantitative and qualitative information about the application
              of legal rules. The sampling frame in this study is broader than in previous
              studies.  It includes a cross-section of urban women-including enslaved women,
              working class white and free women of color, and upper class white women.  This
              breadth will permit an assessment of the influence of ethnicity and
              socio-economic status in the deployment of law.
