Abstract    :
              The research proposes to develop advanced Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS)
              surface modeling techniques to solve four computer aided design (CAD) problems:
              (1) constrained surface design, (2) surface design using the streamline
              modeling methodology,  (3) automatic surface fairing, and (4) automatic joining
              of surfaces. The goal is aiming at developing new and efficient techniques that
              are capable of (1) creating smooth surfaces with continuous first derivative
              (or tangent direction) and prescribed shape properties (such as prescribed
              shape ranges, convexity, and bounded curvature), (2) performing real-time
              surface design by manipulating tangent vectors instead of control points, (3)
              detecting and removing surface irregularities on a fairness model of the given
              surface automatically, and (4) performing smooth, automatic n-sided indirect or
              direct joining with n bigger than or equal to 2.

                    Results
              on the first topic will provide the broad design and modeling community a shape
              generation technique that can be controlled not only in shape ranges, but also
              convexity and curvature distribution and, hence, provide an opportunity to
              address the manufacturability issues in the surface development stage.  Results
              on the second topic will provide design engineers with an interactive surface
              design technique that allows direct manipulation of surface curvature and
              variation of curvature. Results on the third and forth topics will
              significantly shorten the surface fairing and joining processes and,
              consequently, make CAD more proactive and effective in the product development
              process. Overall, results of this research will help reduce both the cost and
              cycle time of the product development process.
