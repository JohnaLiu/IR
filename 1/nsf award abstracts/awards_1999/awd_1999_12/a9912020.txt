This award supports a planning visit for Paula Kantor,
              University of North Carolina to travel to India for three weeks.  PI Kantor and
              Indian collaborator, Jeemol Unni, Gujarat Institute of Development Research,
              Ahmedabad will develop the sampling framework and discuss preliminary aspects
              of their study on Savings and Capital Formation in the Informal Sector in

              India's informal sector which accounts for 80% of households and plays an
              important role in economic development.
