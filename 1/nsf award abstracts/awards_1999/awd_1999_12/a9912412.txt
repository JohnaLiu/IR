Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of new fault models and on-chip test
              methods for large embedded memories in systems-on-chip environments. The fault
              models are being developed using multidimensional device modeling and
              simulation tools that provide dimensional control over individual process
              layers. These fault models are validated with physical experimentation. The
              on-chip test methods include combining the dynamic power supply current, iDDT,
              with traditional deterministic BIST to reduce defect escapes. High-speed iDDT
              testing circuits are being developed to catch frequency-dependent faults. This
              project is being developed in collaboration with Intel Corporation.
