Research Experiences for Undergraduates: REU CRISP
              (Computer Research  Internship Scholastic Program)

 The Computer Research 
              Intership Scholarstic  Program (CRISP) incorporates research projects in the
              following areas of research: Computer  Architecture, Embedded Systesm, 
              Software Engineering, Real-time Systems, VLSI Design, CAD for VLSI, LowPower
              Design, and Optimizing Compilers.  In addition to work in the lab, students
              participate in weekly meetings that include technical presentations from
              leaders in computers and visits to local companies. These activities are done
              jointly with two other undergraduate research programs currently undertaken by
              the department under the MERIT (Maryland Engineering Research Intership Teams)
              pogram.  The professional d development activities consist of
              seminars/workshops on technical writing, oral communcations, graduate
              educations, academic careers, industrial   careers, and professional ethics. 
              At the end of the summer, representatives from indsutry serve as judges for the
              MERIT fair where students from the CRISP program and other similar research
              experience programs present the results of their research and compete against
              each other for the best project award.
