The objective of this project is to investigate novel
              approaches to 
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system identification
              given time-domain noisy measurements of both the (direct) input and output of
              the system, with emphasis on closed loop systems. A goal of the proposed
              research is to provide estimated system models together with evaluated
              (quantified) modeling errors given experimental input-output time-domain data
              for electrical and communications systems operating in open or closed loop.
              Such information (system model and quantified modeling error) is crucial to
              synthesis of a robust controller which maintains its design objectives under
              uncertain modeling, as well as to design of communications systems. Focus is on
              frequency-domain formulation given time-domain measurements, without either
              explicitly modeling various noise/disturbance processes affecting the system or
              requiring a priori knowledge of the same. Subspace methods for state-space
              realization of the MIMO plant operating in a closed loop, are being
              investigated. Successful completion of the proposed research is expected to
              significantly impact the state-of-the-art in robust control design.
