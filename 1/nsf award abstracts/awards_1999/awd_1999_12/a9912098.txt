The proposed effort is to
              explore the effect of nonadsorbing polyelectrolytes on the stability of a
              dispersion of charged particles.  The application of this knowledge would be
              many.  For instance, the fractionation of field flows could be enhanced by the
              presence of nonadsorbing polyelectrolytes.  Central to this study is the
              determination of interparticle forces (as compared to electrostatic and van der
              Waals), as they control the stability of polyelctrolyte-colloid systems. 
              Several directions would be investigated:

1) The influence of increased
              polyelectrolyte concentration on the appearance of flocculation followed, in
              some cases, by restabilization.  A model will hopefully be able to account for
              a comprehensive range of experimental measurements.
2) Polydispersity and
              charge heterogeneity will be correlated with the existing interparticular force
              balance.  This modeling will be established with the help of optical techniques
              (e.g. total internal reflection microscopy).
3) Special attention will be
              given to an important industrial process, viz. the interaction of titanium
              oxyde particles with various types of stabilizers.  In particular,
              surface-particle force profiles will be determined with an atomic force
              microscope.  Flocculation rates will be obtained by acoustic spectrometric
              methods.
4) The role of rod-like geometry in particle interaction will be
              investigated.  Validation will be tested on well-characterized DNA
              segments.
5) The effect of nonadsorbing polyelectrolytes on particle transport
              processes in the vicinity of surfaces will be tested and modeled.  Flow fields
              in or near porous media is of fundamental interest to industrial design.
