Carbon isotope data from Mississippian
              carbonate successions of the western and central United States identifies two
              of the largest positive excursions of the last half-billion years.  The
              excursions appear to reflect episodes of enhanced organic matter burial,
              perhaps induced by collisional tectonics and sea level changes.  The global
              nature of the carbon isotope excursions is, however, unproven and the proposed
              research is focused on characterization of Mississippian seawater carbon
              isotope values in the western United States (Nevada, Missouri) and western
              Europe (Belgium).  Conodont faunas in these regions that were widely separated
              in the Mississippian allow for precise intercontinental correlation of marine
              sedimentary successions.   
	This proposal represents a venture into an
              emerging research area aimed at understanding causal links between previously
              documented changes in sea level and glacigenic sedimentation during the
              Mississippian and changes in carbon cycling indicated by excursions in carbon
              isotopes.  The carbon isotope excursions may also be used as a tool in
              correlation alongside the established conodont zonation.  Previous carbon
              isotope studies have worked at the stage or formation level of resolution and
              thus provide limited constraints on the timing of changes in carbon cycling
              with respect to sea level and faunal turnover.
