Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to generate the fastest tool paths to sweep a
              three-dimensional surface.  This will be accomplished by first developing a
              mathematical formulation which captures all the practical constraints of
              machining, including motor speed limits, acceleration limits, surface finish
              requirements, machine kinematics and the effects of path discontinuities.  It
              is likely that the formulated problem will not yield a closed-form solution. 
              Several numerical approaches will be tested.  A "greedy" approach has shown
              initial promise.  In this approach, the tool paths are denerated using a local
              optimality criterion in place of the global optimality criterion.  A second
              approach is to generate candidate tool path families are using parametric
              "basis" curves.  A third approach which will be studied is a global search; the
              surface will be broken into smaller and smaller elemefltts, and tool paths
              directions will be varied individually in each element.  The third approach is
              computationally expensive, but is also likely to yield the best results.

If
              successful, this research will yield faster tools paths for high speed
              machining.  As the spindle speeds available in CNC machine tools have
              increased, linear actuation systems have increasingly become the bottleneck in
              machining performance. Upgrading to faster linear motor technologies is very
              expensive.  The tool paths enabled by this research will better utilize the
              capabilities of todays machine tool structures with new spindle technologies,
              and enable greater productivity without significantly greater costs.
