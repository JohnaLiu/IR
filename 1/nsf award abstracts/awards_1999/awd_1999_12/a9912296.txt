Abstract    :
              This program is designed to give highly motivated undergraduates, especially
              women and minorities, the chance to develop their skills as anthropological
              field scientists while working within the context of the Lower Cacaulapa
              Project in NW Honduras.  The curriculum will center on student conduct of a
              significant independent field investigation, from enunciation of a hypothesis
              to final write-up of results, supported by in-field class instruction and a
              living and working situation in which interaction among students and PIs is as
              easy as it is intense.  Participants will take a common core of seminars that
              will introduce them to archaeological and ethnographic method and theory and
              sensitize them to the political, cultural, and economic context in which they
              will be living and working.  Intensive training in archaeological and
              ethnographic field procedures will set the stage for definition and pursuit of
              the independent research project.  These investigations will be significant
              explorations of modern and ancient cultural processes, previous students having
              contributed significantly to understandings of local prehistory and
              contemporary behavior patterns.  This course of study will be founded on the
              directors' considerable experience in collaborating with and teaching
              undergraduates within field settings in the past, most particularly on NSF REU
              Site projects that they directed in the Naco Valley, Honduras, during 1988,
              1990, 1992, 1995, and 1996.

The ultimate goal of the project is to help
              students grow from neophyte research assistants to junior colleagues who are
              confident in their abilities to make independent decisions and contribute to
              scientific knowledge.  The 1988-1996 efforts, which form the model for the
              program, accomplished these objectives very successfully and led to the
              decision to extend the project to 2000.
