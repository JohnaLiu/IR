Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to understand better the dynamics of severe
              convective storms and tornadoes.  This goal will be met through the analysis of
              observational data sets and from idealized numerical simulation
              experiments.

Mobile Doppler radar data sets collected in tornadoes will be
              analyzed in detail and a small, focussed field experiment will be conducted to
              collect and analyze additional data in order to obtain a better statistical
              characterization of tornadoes and their environment.  The main thrust of this
              effort will be to estimate wind speeds near the ground in tornadoes, determine
              the three-dimensional wind field in tornadoes, determine why tornadoes form and
              dissipate and find out why some supercell storms produce tornadoes, while
              others do not.

Numerical simulation experiments will be conducted in order
              to understand the dynamics of an elevated rear-inflow jet and a counterrotating
              vortex couplet observed in an airborne Doppler radar analyses of a nontornadic
              supercell hailstorm.  It is hypothesized that the vortex couplet was created
              through the tilting of horizontal vorticity by the downdraft in the storm.  The
              importance of this study is that the rear-inflow jet and vortex couplet may be
              characteristic of a subclass of supercell storms.

Successful completion of
              this research will lead to better conceptual models of tornadoes and tornado
              genesis and eventually lead to more accurate predictions.
