This is a standard workshop award.  This proposal requests support for
              a workshop to be held in Columbia, South Carolina, on September 23-25, 1999, to
              unite researchers in the
area of film and video preservation and digitization
              with experts in film and video history.  The workshop will explore the full
              scope of material needing preservation and access that are film-based but not
              traditional major motion pictures.    Attendees will include scholars in the
              humanities, libraries, archives, film history, computer science, and
              representatives from organizations specializing in film preservation (such as
              George Eastman House).  The workshop would bring together a rather scattered
              community and look at a new problem, the extension of digitization techniques
              and digital libraries to
motion picture film outside the context of major
              studio features.
