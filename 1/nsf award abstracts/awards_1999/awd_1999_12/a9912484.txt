This award to Oregon State University will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Wecoma, a research
              vessel operated by the university as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes a salinometer, computers for operation of the existing
              undulating towed profiler system, refurbishing existing computers for operation
              of the acoustic doppler current profiler, telemetry upgrade (to fiber optic)
              for the undulating tow vehicle, optical fiber termination tools and equipment,
              and an optical plankton counter for use with towed profiler.  The shared-use
              instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies,
              particularly in  the Northeast Pacific Ocean, during 2000 and future years. 
              Instruments related to upgrade of the undulating towed profiler will be used
              heavily in impending GLOBEC field programs in the region, a collaborative
              effort between NSF and NOAA to investigate relationships among physical
              processes and fisheries-related biological processes.
