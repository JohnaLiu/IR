Abstract    :
              9912472  Jenkins  Enhanced Biological Phosphorous Removal (EBPR) is an activated
              sludge wastewater treatment process modification in which anaerobic/aerobic
              cycling of activated sludge produces a higher than normal biomass phosphorous
              content.  This research seeks to (1) characterize the key organisms whose
              presence is necessary for efficient EBPR operation, (2) determine how these
              organisms regulate and control the genes and gene products associated with EBPR
              metabolism and (3) determine the relationship between community structure,
              metabolic activity and process performance.  Specifically, the research will
              include: survey of prototype plants, correlation of population dynamics with
              process performance in laboratory scale reactors, cloning of genes for
              polyphosphate and polyhydroxyalkanoate metabolisms, determination of gene
              expression patterns in mixed community cultures focusing especially on the
              shifts between anaerobic and aerobic phases,  and correlation of various
              process upsets with changes in community structure and with changes in
              intracellular metabolism in a stable community structure.  The observations
              will be integrated to develop recommendations for potential control strategies
              for full-scale EBPR systems.  In addition to the application of EBPR, this
              research will improve the understanding of the microbial ecology of activated
              sludge and of the methods that microorganisms use to survive shortages of
              carbon, phosphorous and oxygen. ***
