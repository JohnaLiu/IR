Abstract    :
              The Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study field program
              (STEPS), planned for the early summer of 2000 in western Kansas, will provide a
              wide range of observations in and around thunderstorms using aircraft, radar,
              and other observing systems.  As part of STEPS, Dr. MacGorman and his Co-PI Dr.
              David Rust will launch balloons that are equipped to measure and transmit back
              to ground the temperature, wind speed and direction, and electric field
              strength as the balloons ascend through thunderstorms.  Objectives of the
              research are (1) to examine the genesis of lightning flashes relative to the
              charge distribution of different types of severe storms; (2) to ascertain
              whether the relatively infrequent occurrence of positively charged
              cloud-to-ground lightning is associated with hail production and may be used as
              an indicator of storm severity; (3) to determine the electrical structure of
              thunderstorms in relation to the air motions and precipitation in the storms. 
              Analysis of the data will be closely coordinated with other NSF-supported STEPS
              projects, including the New Mexico Tech lightning mapper (ATM-9912073), the
              CHILL radar (ATM-9912051 and -9982030), and the South Dakota armored T-28
              airplane (ATM-9981175).
