ABSTRACT            Marshall Sundberg                DBI# 9912283

Ten
              students per year will be brought to the Ross Natural History Reservation, in
              the Flint Hills of Kansas, to work on a variety of projects related to the
              tallgrass prairie.  Participants will be selected from a national pool and will
              live and work in a field research situation for an eight week summer session. 
              Each participant will be matched to a research laboratory with ongoing
              projects, but each participant will be encouraged to engage in an independent
              problem relating to the area of ongoing work.  Areas of research will range
              from large scale ecological problems to cell and molecular biological
              approaches.  Appropriate field laboratories will be maintained at the Ross
              Natural History Reservation, with back-up support available on the main Emporia
              campus.  A communications skills workshop and formal seminar program will help
              prepare participants to effectively present the results of their research.  A
              special program on honor and ethics in science will involve participants,
              mentors and graduate students, other faculty and students ,and the community
              at-large.  Extension of the research beyond the summer session will be
              encouraged and it is expected that all participants will present their results
              at a local or regional scientific meeting.
