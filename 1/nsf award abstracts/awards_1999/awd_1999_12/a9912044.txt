              ABSTRACT

OCE-9912044

Understanding the export flux of particles from the
              surface ocean to the oceanic interior is an important aspect of the global
              carbon balance, and as such has great relevance to understanding the dynamics
              of climate change. Until recently, surface fluxes have been investigated by
              surface tethered floating sediment traps (STST), but these have been plagued by
              uncertainties in artifacts inherent in their design. This project will test a
              new approach to measuring surface flux by way of a neutrally buoyant sediment
              trap (NBST) for studies of biogeochemical cycling in the upper ocean.  The
              hypothesis to be tested is that direct sampling of the upper ocean export flux
              can best be accomplished by the use of NBSTs that drift freely with horizontal
              currents while maintaining a specified depth. The plan is to deploy NBSTs on
              five cruises in the Sargasso Sea, and measure the 234Th water column inventory
              and associated trap activity.
