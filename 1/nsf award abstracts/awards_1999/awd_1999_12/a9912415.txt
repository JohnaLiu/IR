Abstract    :
              This grant will develop novel high performance numerical algorithms and codes
              for critical problems in large dynamical systems.  This includes reducing
              models to fewer degrees of freedom,  better eigenvalue solvers, and parallel
              implementations.  This project has applications ranging from control systems to
              electric power systems, circuit simulations, earth sciences (meterology,
              hydrology), and filtering.

This is a joint project together with CCR-9912388
              by Ahmed Sameh of Purdue University.
