Proposal Title: RUI: A Proposal under the RISE Program
              to Support Observations and Analysis of Solar Irradiance
              Variations

The investigators will determine those aspects of
              solar activity responsible for irradiance and luminosity changes and to apply
              this knowledge to modeling of irradiance changes from ground-based
              observations. A second main goal is to gain understanding of the physical
              processes by which magnetic activity modifies the flow of energy from the solar
              interior in such a way as to produce changes in luminosity and irradiance at
              the Earth. The main effort is to theoretical approaches to these problems in
              the context of extending the dataset returned from the San Fernando
              Observatory, which is uniquely able to carry out the proposed observational
              program.
