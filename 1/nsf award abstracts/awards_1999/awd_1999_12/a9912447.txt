Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop new paradigms for coordination and
              control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are anticipated to have
              wide-range of applications, including fighting forest fires, human rescue
              during natural disasters, protection of crops, surveillance of a city,
              monitoring of enemy, and mitigation of threats. The basic and unique
              contribution of this work is to develop strategies and algorithms for feasible
              and optimal planning of groups of autonomous systems to satisfy their governing
              equations and applicable constraints. The goal is to reduce on-line
              computations close to real-time by exploiting the inherent "feedback
              linearizable" or "differentially flat" structure of dynamic systems. The PI
              plans to simultaneously undertake two complementary directions: (i) develop
              algorithms for coordinated planning of a fleet of UAVs, and (ii) test these
              algorithms on a laboratory test-bed with free-floating vehicles.
