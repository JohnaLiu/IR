Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for a workshop on Collaboration and Standardization
              in Supply Chain Management to be held  at University of California - Berkeley.
              The workshop will explore the opportunities presented by supply chain
              partnerships and identify logistics challenges into the next century. The
              workshop will facilitate 
cross-industry and cross-disciplinary exchange of
              ideas and experiences, focusing on identifying both current bast practices and
              critical research issues. Workshop topics will include logistics issues related
              to recent developments in the use of information sharing between different
              supply chain parties, and current efforts 
to standard supply chain processes
              to handle information and material flows.

If successful, this workshop will
              encourage collaborative work on critical research issues between university and
              industry.
