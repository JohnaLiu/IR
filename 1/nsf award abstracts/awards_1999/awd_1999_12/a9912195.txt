Purdue University establishes a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site with a focus on characterization and processing of
              materials.  Twelve undergraduate students are recruited nationwide for a
              nine-week summer research experience, with a recruitment focus on science
              majors from predominantly undergraduate institutions.  Students are involved in
              materials research that includes processing of polymers, metals and ceramics,
              oxidation and etching of silicon, processing of metal-ceramic composites. 
              Faculty from the students' home institutions are invited to visit the REU Site
              to encourage them to incorporate materials concepts into their
              curricula.

Science, mostly chemistry and physics, students from
              undergraduate institutions are introduced to materials science and engineering
              concepts through tutorials and research projects.  This outreach to
              non-engineering students addresses the general lack of awareness about
              materials science and engineering in the traditional science undergraduate
              curriculum and provides a mechanism to propagate information about the
              field.
