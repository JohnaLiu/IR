Abstract    :
              The objective of this request is to acquire a bundled High 
Performance Liquid
              Chromatography (HPLC)/LCQ ion trap mass 
spectrometer for use in several
              research projects, and for the 
training of students.  The new LQC ion trap
              mass spectrometers are 
able to perform amino acid sequencing experiments, DNA
              sequencing 
experiments, mapping of peptide phosphorylation sites and
              
oligosaccharide analysis, in addition to more traditional small 
molecule
              characterization.  The use of this equipment has the 
following specific aims:
              (1) to provide core knowledge and 
training to undergraduate and graduate
              students on the use of LCQ 
ion trap mass spectrometry in at least three
              different 
bioengineering applications which are detailed in the specific
              
aims 2 to 4; (2) to sequence and characterize gene products for 
engineering
              Escherichia coli with enhanced protein secretion via a 
proteome science
              strategy and to make this information web-
accessible; (3) to better define
              and understand the relationship 
between protein glycosylation and
              environmental conditions in the 
insect cell baculovirus expression system to
              achieve complex 
glycosylation of a model protein; and (4) to characterize
              
polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated peptides and proteins, and test 
hypotheses
              regarding structure and biodistribution of 
macromolecular drugs.
