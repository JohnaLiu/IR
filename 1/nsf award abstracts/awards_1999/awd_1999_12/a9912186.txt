The study examines the relationship between the
              ideology of newspaper publishers and the ideology embedded in new stories. 
              That is, what are the most important factors that influence the collection and
              selection of information and the preparation and presentation of the news about
              events and issues?  The research seeks to answer several questions-(1) Do
              publishers share a taken-for-granted ideology that reflects their upper class
              experiences and corporate interest? (2) Do publishers establish and maintain
              the newsroom norms that reflect their taken-for-granted ideologies? (3) Does
              news content contain the taken-for-granted orientations of publishers? (4) Do
              individual newspapers and newspaper groups differ in the underlying ideology of
              their publishers and in the underlying ideology in their news content? (5) Is
              there an inner circle of chains and their affiliated newspapers that are much
              closer to a class-wide taken-for granted ideology than the rest of the
              newspaper industry?

Data will be analyzed from in depth structured
              interviews with a nationally representative sample of newspaper publishers and
              the most senior operational executives at 119 daily newspapers.  In addition,
              the content of issues of each newspaper for two reconstituted weeks (plus two
              election days) in 1998.  In total more than 550 hours of interviews and
              approximately 2,000 newspapers will be coded and analyzed.  Specialized
              computer applications will be used to analyzed the conversational materials and
              generate categories and to determine whether the publishers have an ideology;
              whether a newsroom ideology exists that distinguishes newspapers, and whether
              there may be a corporate culture within the chain as a whole.
