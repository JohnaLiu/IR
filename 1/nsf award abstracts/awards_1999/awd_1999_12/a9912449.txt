This US-Brazil award provides support for cooperative
              research between Dr. Maurice J. Tauber and Catherine A. Tauber of Cornell
              University and Dr. Gilberto S. Albuquerque of the Universidade Estadual do
              Norte Fluminense on the lacewings of Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest, in an
              assessment of their diversity.
This project will permit the assessment of the
              diversity of two insect families (Chrysopidae and Hemerobiidae) in and around
              Desengano State Park, a major remnant of Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest.  With
              intensive fieldwork and laboratory rearing of these predacious insects, this
              research will develop an extensive regional collection of adult and larval
              specimens and gather comparative life-history data for taxonomic studies.  The
              fieldwork will also generate representative specimens of other insect groups
              for use in the Brazilian university's reference collection of local insects.
