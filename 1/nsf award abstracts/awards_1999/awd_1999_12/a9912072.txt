Abstract    :
              How magma is supplied to the crust at a mid-ocean ridge crest and the mode of
              emplacement - both processes which shape the basic architecture of extrusive
              oceanic crust - are crucial to understanding crustal accretion at MORs.
              Along-axis variations in crestal cross-sectional shape and area on
              fast-spreading MORs reflect the interplay between magmatic and tectonic
              processes which dictate the generation and partitioning of melt along the axis.
               Despite improvements in seismic techniques and detailed seafloor geologic
              mapping of selected areas on the MOR crest, our knowledge of the spatial and
              temporal variations of intrusion and eruption at MORs is very limited. 
              Understanding the relationship between shallow crustal structure, seafloor
              morphology and the production and distribution of majma is crucual to our
              understanding of how oceanic crust forms.
