Green Process Technologies include the conception, design,
              implementation or production of products or processes using techniques that are
              environmentally friendly.  This term covers a wide range of topics from
              pollution prevention in a manufacturing facility to environmentally benign
              treatment of materials.  Related terms, such as environmentally benign or
              environmentally conscious manufacturing are also used to describe the approach
              of reducing the amount and toxicity of wastes prior to treatment.  The overall
              purpose of this 10-week summer REU Site is to provide an educational research
              experience for a diverse student population in the area of Green Processing . 
              The faculty research mentors involved in the program have an extensive track
              record in the area of environmentally benign processing.  Students and faculty
              interact with the Kenan Center for the Utilization of Carbon Dioxide in
              Manufacturing and the NSF Science and Technology Center for Environmentally
              Responsible Solvents and Processes both located at North Carolina State
              University.  In addition to a traditional research program directed by faculty
              mentors, professors in the NSF sponsored Research Ethics Initiative at NCSU
              will conduct an ethics symposium series focused on topics in engineering and
              environmental ethics.
