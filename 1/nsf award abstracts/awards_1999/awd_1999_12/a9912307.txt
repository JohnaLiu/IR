The University of Connecticut establishes a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site with a focus on molecular materials.
              Eight undergraduate students are recruited per year, nationwide, for a ten-week
              summer research experience, with a recruitment focus on students from
              undergraduate institutions in the northeast.

Students are involved in
              interdisciplinary polymer research and have access to the research facilities
              of the Institute of Materials Science at the University of Connecticut.  In
              addition, students participate in weekly seminars and in an end-of-the-summer
              research symposium that includes faculty from their home institutions.
