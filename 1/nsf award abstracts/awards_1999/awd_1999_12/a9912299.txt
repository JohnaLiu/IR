This is a collaborative project with
              Brian Powell (SES-9912267).  Inital funding from the National Science
              Foundation was used to identify whether there is a relationship between
              parental age and the allocation of economic, social and cultural resources to
              teenagers.  The investigators found strong evidence of a generally positive
              relationship, with the effects being strongest among economic resources that
              were allocated to teenage children. The factors influencing parental
              investments in adolescent offspring, however, may not operate in the same
              fashion for investments in young children.  Parental investments that most
              influence adolescent outcomes (e.g., high school graduate, matriculation in
              college) may not necessarily be the same as those that influence child outcomes
              (e.g., adjustment in kindergarten).  The major object of this study is to test
              whether the patterns demonstrated in the study of teenagers can be generalized
              to parental investments in young children.  The National Household Education
              Survey of 1993: School Readiness and The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study,
              Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 will be used to complete this analysis 

The
              research will fill a gap in current scholarship and also have clear
              implications for social policy.  Although previous research has generated a
              significant set of findings for adolescents, it is unclear whether the same
              relationship will hold for young children.  If resource allocation hinders or
              benefits young children, especially at the critical and early stages when they
              are entering school, then knowing which resources are most affected by parental
              age may guide policy makers and parents in determining those resources that
              need to be supplemented.  This study also addressed questions about the optimal
              timing of childbearing.
