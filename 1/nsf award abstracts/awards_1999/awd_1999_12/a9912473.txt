Abstract    :
              Key to understanding the circulation of the middle atmosphere (stratosphere and
              mesosphere) is the ability to characterize the role of gravity waves in the
              transport and deposition of momentum.  Given the scales at which the middle
              atmosphere is modeled, the processes involving gravity waves occur at sub-grid
              scales;  thus, the effects of gravity waves must be parameterized in the
              models.  These parameterizations require some knowledge of the gravity wave
              spectrum at the tropopause as input, but at this time, little is known about
              that spectrum because of lack of appropriate data.  In 1998, high-resolution
              radiosonde measurements of wind and temperature became available for the first
              time.  

	Dr. Geller and his colleagues will analyze the U.S. high-resolution
              radiosonde wind and temperature data for the years 1998-2001.  Their analyses
              will provide the kind of information on gravity wave spectra that is needed to
              develop realistic parameterizations for middle atmosphere models.    Similar
              analyses of radiosonde data have been done in Australia for that region and
              have provided very useful information on the morphology of gravity waves.  The
              analyzed data sets will be made available to the international community
              through the Stratospheric Processes and Their Role in Climate (SPARC) Data
              Center web site which current resides at SUNY-Stony Brook. 

In addition to
              developing this data set, Dr. Geller also will perform a number of additional
              analyses in an attempt to identify the tropospheric sources of gravity waves. 
              They will also examine, to the extent possible, the interannual variability of
              the gravity wave spectrum over the U.S.
