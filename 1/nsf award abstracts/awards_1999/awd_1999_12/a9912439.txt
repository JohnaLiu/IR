This Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates Site provides opportunities in bioengineering and
              biosurfaces for 17 students per summer at The University of Memphis.  As the
              result of NSF support over the past 3 years, a high-quality program has been
              built and sustained.  Many capable and highly motivated students from primarily
              undergraduate colleges as well as research universities have been attracted to
              this program.  Each participant undertakes a specific research project in the
              following areas:  bioaerosols (airborne particulates), biomaterials (implants),
              biofluid dynamics (modeling human respiratory tract), biosensors (hear, blood
              pressure, muscle displacement, etc.), and electrocardiology (heart simulation
              by signal processing, electromagnetics, computer models, etc.).  Each student
              works with a faculty mentor to develop his/her research skills.  An essential
              element of the program is its emphasis on the professional development of
              students (e.g., paper writing and technical presentations).  The purpose is to
              infuse bright undergraduate students with an enthusiasm towards graduate level
              education and research careers.
