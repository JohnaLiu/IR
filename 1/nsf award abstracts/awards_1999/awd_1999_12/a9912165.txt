Abstract    :
              This award  is for travel support for graduate students and young scientists to
              attend the Chapman Conference on The Gaia Hypothesis to be held in Valencia,
              Spain June 19-23 2000. A  fundamental intellectual question in geosciences is
              the role of life in regulating the biosphere's  biogeochemical cycles and
              climate. The Gaia hypothesis asserts that interaction between the biota and the
              physical and chemical environment is large enough to serve as an active
              feedback capacity for biogeoclimatologic control. On the other hand many
              environmental changes over geological time scales can be explained using
              geochemical arguments, regardless of the contribution to life. The first
              Chapman conference on the Gaia hypothesis was held in 1988 to examine the
              possibility of active climate regulation systems and the relative importance of
              feedback processes between organic and inorganic environmental components. A
              ten-year interval has elapsed since that conference. The objective of the
              second conference is to focus on the work initiated since, and to update
              material from the first conference
