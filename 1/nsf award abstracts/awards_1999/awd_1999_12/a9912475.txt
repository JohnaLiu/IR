Abstract    :
              Hybrid particle-finite element methods offer an approach to modeling
particular
              impact problems not well suited to simulation with conventional
Eulerian,
              Lagrangian, or particle codes. This research will extend and
validate a new
              hybrid particle-finite element technique, in which particles
are used to model
              contact-impact and volumetric deformation while finite
elements are employed
              to represent interparticle tension forces and
elastic-plastic deviatoric
              deformation. Validation will be performed via
simulations of published
              hypervelocity impact experiments. Formulation of
the method employs a novel
              thermomechanical Hamiltonian approach. The
research will provide a robust
              computer simulation technique for a wide
range of impact and fragmentation
              problems.
