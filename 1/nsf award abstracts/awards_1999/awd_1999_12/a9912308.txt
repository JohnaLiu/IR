Abstract    :
              The PI requests funding to initiate a summer internship program at Old Dominion
              University that will focus on biogeochemistry and will be specifically geared
              to encourage participation from minorities. Collaborative biogeochemistry
              projects will include (1) trace element chemistry of natural water and (2)
              biogeochemical processes in marine systems. The program will support 10
              students who will be recruited from four-year colleges, including several
              HBCUs. The program will include weekly seminars on scientific and ethical
              topics. This proposal is supported by the NSF Ethics and Values (EVS) program.
              The proposal also contains significant cost sharing from the University.
