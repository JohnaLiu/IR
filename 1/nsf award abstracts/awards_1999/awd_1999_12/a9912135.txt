Abstract    :
              Caldwell/99-12135
This award provides renewed funding for a program called
              "Native Americans in Marine Science" or NAMS. The program recruits Native
              American and Native Alaskan students for undergraduate programs at the
              University of Oregon. The long-term goal of this program is to increase the
              number of minority students who complete degrees in science, continue their
              studies in graduate school, and enter the scientific work force. The program
              was initiated in 1991 and has provided the financial support and mentoring
              necessary for 87 students to continue their higher education and gain research
              experience. The award provides continued funding to support 20 students for an
              additional year.
