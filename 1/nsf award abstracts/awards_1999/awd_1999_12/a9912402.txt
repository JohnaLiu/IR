Abstract    :
              Gilligan/99-12402
This award provides renewed funding for an REU site at that
              is a collaborative effort between Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute (HBOI)
              and Savannah State University (SSU) called the Bridge to Research Program. The
              program recruits talented and high achieving science, engineering and
              mathematics undergraduate students as early as their sophomore year. During the
              three years of this grant period, they expect to recruit thirteen students each
              summer for the two-phase program. Most of the students participating in the
              program are from minority/under-represented groups. During the first phase of
              the program, students will be housed at SSU and will participate in group
              research projects that are designed to encourage active collaboration and group
              cohesion. During the fifth week, the students move to HBOI for a more intensive
              individual research program. They give written and oral presentations at the
              end of the program, and are encouraged to publish results and present at
              national meetings following the program.
