Abstract    :
              Inverness Research Associates will hold a workshop for Principal Investigators
              (PIs) and Project Directors (PDs) of new and mature Rural Systemic Initiatives
              (RSIs), and will produce and distribute workshop proceedings in the form of a
              monograph afterward.  The workshop will foster and capture discussions among
              RSI key personnel who have been with the program since its inception, and with
              key personnel of Initiatives that have more recently received funding.  The
              discussants will share "lessons learned" about strategies, methodologies, and
              results that have been gleaned from five-plus years of involvement with
              systemic reform.
