Participants will be recruited from high quality institutions
              that focus primarily on undergraduate education.  The students will undertake
              an intense IO week summer research program that introduces them to a research
              problem, trains them in the experimental approaches that are used to attack the
              problem, stimulates them to develop independence, and enhances their ability to
              communicate scientific information to others.  The research projects in which
              the students will participate will focus on the use of molecular biological
              approaches to solve problems in genetics, cell and developmental biology. 
              Particular emphasis will be placed on the students' independent planning of
              experiments, interpretation of experimental data, and presentation of their
              observations to other students and faculty.  The REU students will participate
              in the weekly meetings of each research group as well as the weekly REU seminar
              series to share their experiences and broaden their exposure to different
              research areas.  At the end of the summer, the students will write a summary of
              their experimental results and present their results to the entire department
              in a poster format.  The REU experience is designed to expose the students to
              an intense yet rewarding research experience and to encourage them to pursue a
              career in biological research.
