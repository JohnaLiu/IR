Abstract    :
              This project studies techniques for designing video signal processors (VSPs),
              which are single-chip processors for video and other multimedia data. The
              project considers both hardware and software optimization techniques for video
              signal processor architectures and the programs that run on them. As a first
              step, the project analyzes the characteristics of modern multimedia
              applications, including analysis as well as traditional compression
              applications. One goal is to develop techniques for optimizing the design of a
              VSP based on application characteristics. The project also considers techniques
              for optimizing software running on VLIW and other styles of VSPs. The design of
              memory system performance is an especially important consideration for both
              hardware and software optimization.
