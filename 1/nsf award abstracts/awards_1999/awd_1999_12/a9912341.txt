Abstract    :
               ATM9912341abs

The investigators will conduct research using data from
              neutron monitors and other instruments on the Ulysses and IMP-8 spacecraft, and
              continue precision observations by the Climax and Huancayo Mountain cosmic
              radiation neutron stations.  The research will focus on charged particle modes
              of propagation in the three-dimensional heliosphere, and charged particle
              acceleration phenomena in solar flares and coronal mass ejections.  Using the
              Ulysses data, the investigators will study the recurrent 26-day modulation in
              cosmic ray intensity observed at high solar latitudes.  They will also show how
              direct solar neutron detection during solar particle events provide information
              about particle acceleration mechanisms.  The support will allow continuation of
              the 47 year record of cosmic ray observations from ground-based stations.
