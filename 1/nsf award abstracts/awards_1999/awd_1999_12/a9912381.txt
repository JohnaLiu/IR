Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for an REU Site in Sociology at Texas A&M University. 
              The program consists of a year-long research experience and training program
              for ten undergraduate students who are considering graduate school in
              sociology.  The eight-week summer program will include research projects under
              the supervision of a faculty member, classroom and laboratory training,
              participation in field trips and professional development seminars, and formal
              presentations of research papers at professional conferences.  Students will
              continue their research and mentoring experiences during the following academic
              year at their home institutions.  Students will be recruited from universities
              in Texas that do not have doctoral programs in sociology and that have large
              enrollments of students from population groups that are underrepresented in
              graduate programs in sociology.

This award contributes to the Foundation's
              continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through
              active undergraduate research experiences.
