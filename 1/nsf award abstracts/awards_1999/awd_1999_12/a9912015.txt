Abstract    :
              Award is for Direct Current Plasma (DC)) trace element analysis of quench melt
              glasses from the offshore Puna Ridge, an underwater extension of Kilauea"s East
              Rift Zone, and for their petrological interpretation.  These glasses were
              collected by dredging and rock coring during a previous expedition that also
              mapped the Puna Ride by side-scan sonar, deep-tow video and photography, and
              near-bottom magnetometer.  These analyses are a crucial part of a larger effort
              aimed at investigating the volcanic and magmatic processes occurring on the
              Puna Ridge, a critical part of Kilauea as most of the sampled near-primary
              melts erupted from he volcano come from this ridge.
