Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the renewal of a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates Site in Minority Group Demography at the University of Texas at
              Austin.  The Sociology Department and the interdisciplinary Population Research
              Center have hosted an REU Site for the last ten years.  Eight students will be
              exposed to demography via course work, seminars, and hands-on research
              apprenticeships with faculty.  In addition, they will write scholarly papers,
              present their work in colloquia and conferences, and participate in
              professionalization workshops.  Students may be affiliated with projects
              ranging from race/ethnic infant mortality differentials, to the experiences of
              women of color in the labor market, to the performance differentials among
              college students by ascribed statuses like ethnicity and gender.  An Ethics
              Proseminar will introduce professional ethics as an explicit part of the
              curriculum and professional socialization efforts.

This award contributes to
              the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers
              in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
