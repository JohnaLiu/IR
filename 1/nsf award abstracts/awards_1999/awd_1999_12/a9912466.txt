Skidaway Institute of Oceanography will operate the R/V
              Blue Fin during 2000 as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of
              NSF-supported research projects.  The Blue Fin is a 72 ft. vessel, constructed
              in 1972 and refitted in 1976, and owned and operated by Board of Regents
              University System of Georgia.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 91
              operational days during 2000, of which 53 days are in support of NSF-supported
              investigators.  The remaining cruises will support Navy, NOAA, and NASA
              projects.  The projects scheduled on the Blue Fin primarily support research
              programs in biological, physical and chemical oceanography on the US Southeast
              Continental Shelf, sounds, and estuaries between Capes Hatteras and
              Canaveral.

The Blue fin is part of a fleet of ships used by the National
              Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic
              projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on
              the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not
              operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF
              supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to
              oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions
              around the country.
