Abstract    :
              Concerns about changes in the world's environment have led scientists from many
              different nations to collaborate on a broad range of research and training
              activities.  Many of these activities are coordinated by one or more of three
              major international organizations:  the World Climate Research Program (WCRP),
              which is overseen by the World Meteorological Organization; the International
              Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), which is overseen by the International
              Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU); and the International Human Dimensions
              Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP), which is overseen by the
              International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) with cooperation from the
              International Social Science Council (ISSC).  Administrative coordination of
              IHDP activities is undertaken by the IHDP Secretariat, which functions at the
              University of Bonn under a major grant from the German Ministry for Education,
              Science, Research and Technology (BMBF).  This award is one of three
              collaborative awards that provide support for three sets of administrative
              activities to further IHDP programs:  (1) support for the IHDP Secretariat's
              core budget to enable it to enhance and expand the involvement of new
              scientific activities, to build human dimensions of global change (HDGC)
              infrastructure in developing nations and transition economies, and to involve
              more researchers from developing nations and transition economies in IHDP
              activities; (2) support for the work of the Focus 1 office of the Land-Use and
              Land-Cover Change (LUCC) Project office at Indiana University, to enable it to
              promote and support research and networking activities associated with the
              Land-Use Dynamics comparative case-study analyses; and (3) support for the work
              of the International Project Office (IPO) of the International Dimensions of
              Global Environmental Change project at Dartmouth College.  Through these
              activities, collaborative, interdisciplinary research on important topics
              dealing with human-environmental interaction around the globe are facilitated,
              as is the involvement of the scientists from many nations, especially those
              from developing nations who otherwise lack the resources to engage in these
              broad-ranging efforts.  Core support for IHDP Secretariat activities is
              provided by NSF on behalf of the agencies participating in the U.S. Global
              Change Research Program (USGCRP), while additional support for the involvement
              of scientists from developing nations as well as support for the Focus 1 Office
              and the IDGCE-IPO is provided by the NSF Directorate for Social, Behavioral,
              and Economic Sciences.
