              Abstract

This project seeks to develop an Internet accessible software broker
              to match scientists and engineers (or companies of such) offering algorithms,
              and/or their use, for a fee to algorithm users.  To this end this project
              includes a theoretical investigation into scheduling, accounting and pricing
              related to electronic brokers for open electronic markets for algorithmic
              intellectual property.  The technology for developing this broker would make
              use of the capabilities of the Internet, interoperable software such as JAVA
              and CORBA as well as new scheduler and accounting advances to be made in this
              research program.
