Abstract    :
              Morin/99-12315
This grant provides funding to initiate an 8-week summer
              internship program at the Shoals Marine Laboratory (SML), a seasonally operated
              field station located on Appledore Island in the Gulf of Maine. The field
              station is jointly operated by Cornell University and the University of New
              Hampshire (UNH). The REU Site will provide students with training in field and
              laboratory research in marine biology and ecology, including research in marine
              invertebrates, birds, and plants. Faculty mentors for the students will be
              selected from scientists at Cornell University, University of New Hamphsire,
              Brown University, University of Washington, and Merrimack College who have
              on-going research projects at the Shoals Marine Laboratory.  The REU students
              will spend 8 weeks immersed in marine biology research projects under the
              guidance of his/her faculty mentor. The students will also participate in
              weekly discussion groups, field trips, and journal club meetings. The grant
              will also provide funding for three undergraduate students and a faculty
              instructor to participate in an international research/education project in
              Akumal, Mexico. The students will spend 8 weeks involved in a coral reef
              monitoring project. This project is jointly funded by the U.S. and Mexico.
