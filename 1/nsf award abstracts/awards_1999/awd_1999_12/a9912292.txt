Abstract    :
              Funds are provided to evaluate the deformation on the Gorda plate using
              recently-acquired bathymetric data which needs to be processed and interpreted
              to understand the nature of seafloor structures and how they relate to
              deformation processes. The study is a unique opportunity to assess interplate
              deformation where there is a large amount of high-quality data available. The
              PI's will analyze the excellent large multibeam bathymetry dataset collected
              over the Gorda plate and, in parallel, numerical models will be run by a
              collaborator that will be integrated with the findings of the PIs. It could
              provide important structural and tectonic results with important implications
              for other studies.
