Objects, actions and events are the
              physical building blocks of human experience.  While we know a great deal about
              how infants and toddlers think and talk about objects, we know very little
              about how they think and talk about actions.  Actions are the glue around which
              events are organized.  When a bat strikes a ball, it is the act of striking
              that defines the relationship between the two objects.  Similarly, the verb is
              the "hero" of the sentence around which the rest of the sentence is organized. 
              This project examines the ways in which infants and toddlers conceptualize
              action and link language to actions.  Two questions are posed.  The first asks
              how children perceive and form categories of action.  Why, for example do we
              categorize an act of running by our grandmother as the same sort of action as
              that performed by Carl Lewis? The second question asks how we attach labels to
              those categories of action.  For example, do children think that the word
              "running" only applies to the first person they saw performing that action? 
              Or, do they know from the start that running applies both to the first person
              they saw running as well as to their grandmother and to Carl Lewis?  This grant
              is the among the first to address these key questions about language and
              thought.  As such, it represents a new frontier toward understanding   how
              children learn language and in particular, how they talk about the actions they
              see.
