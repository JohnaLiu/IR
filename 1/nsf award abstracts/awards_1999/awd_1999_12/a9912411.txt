Abstract    :
              For many years, the de-facto standard method for representing geometric shapes
              in a computer has been non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). However, NURBS
              have some well-known limitations. One of them is the surface intersection
              problem:  if you intersect two NURBS surfaces, the result cannot be represented
              exactly as a trimmed NURBS surface for reasons that can be proven using
              algebraic geometry.  This project will explore ways of converting NURBS
              surfaces into non-uniform Catmull-Clark surfaces (NURCC) without data-loss, and
              how to express the intersection of two NURCCs as a single NURCC.  A second
              problem with NURBS is that they cannot seamlessly represent shapes with
              arbitrary topological complexity.  This project will explore how to represent
              the union of two or more NURBS surfaces as a single continuous NURCC surface.
