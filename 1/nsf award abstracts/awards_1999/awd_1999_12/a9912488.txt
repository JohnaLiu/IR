This
              grant provides funds for travel grant awards to U. S. authors of papers
              accepted for presentation and U. S. plenary lectures at the Third Joint
              USA/China Chemical Engineering Conference (CUChE-3) to be held in Beijing China
              on September 25-28, 2000.  The theme of the Third Conference is Chemical
              Engineering for the 21st Century.  The Third Joint Conference will serve as an
              ideal forum for U. S. Chemical Engineers to meet their counterparts in China to
              exchange research ideas and opportunities for cooperation.  As in the last two
              Conferences, the AIChE and its Chinese counterpart, Chemical Industry and
              Engineering Society of China (CIESC), will be sponsors of the Conference.  In
              addition, the counterpart chemical engineering societies of Germany, Japan and
              Korea will join in as co-sponsors, thus expanding the scope and impact of the
              Conference.  The Third Conference will be the largest formal international
              conference in Chemical Engineering.  This grant will provide for 30-35 partial
              travel grant awards to U. S. authors of papers and invited plenary lectures at
              the Conference.  Travel awards will be made based on the following
              considerations; (1) scientific or technological merit of the paper; (2)
              availability of others sources of travel funding; (3)  institutional and
              geographical distribution.
