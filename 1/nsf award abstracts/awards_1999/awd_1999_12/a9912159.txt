This US-Mexico award will support a planning visit by
              Dr. Kevin H. Johannesson of Old Dominion University to the Universidad Nacional
              Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) to meet with Dr. Alejandra Cortes of that university
              in order to discuss, organize, and outline an appropriate strategy for
              conducting a detailed hydrogeologic and hydrogeochemical investigation of the
              Cuatro Cienegas groundwater system in northeastern Mexico.  The planning
              meeting will involve discussions of field sites, identifying and prioritizing
              study objectives, and overall project planning, and will lead to the
              development of a proposal for a multi-year study.  This study will help to
              increase our knowledge of carbonate aquifers, which provide water supplies for
              roughly one quarter of the world's human population.
