Abstract    :
              This REU Site features simultaneous programs in algebra and applied analysis,
              each emphasizing computer-assisted collaborative experimentation.  The analytic
              component is concerned with problems in the filtering, detection, and
              compression of signals. These questions naturally arise in many real-world
              settings, and the primary mathematical technique used by the students in this
              study is wavelet analysis. Typical student projects involve satelite
              transmission of meteorological data, compression and storage of fingerprint
              images, and fuel burnout in rocket engines. Both symbolic and numeric
              computations are needed for these investigations.
     
The algebraic
              component is focused on matrix solutions to finite systems of noncommutative
              algebraic equations and on related computational issues. These algebraic
              systems usually define more abstract structures (e.g., groups, Lie algebras, or
              generalizations thereof), and have played an important role in modern
              mathematical physics. Typical student projects focus on the irreducible
              representations of quantum groups and Lie superalgebras, and on the generation
              of generic matrix algebras. Symbolic computation plays a
key role
              throughout.

Additional projects will be organized in conjunction with
              research seminar courses sponsored by the department's NSF VIGRE grant.
