Abstract    :
              The planned work will examine the reasons why there exists an upper bound for
              tropical Sea Surface Temperature (SST)  in the western Pacific. The role of El
              Nino in regulating the SST will be studied. The hypothesis to be tested is the
              following: once the tropical maximum SST is sufficiently warm to sustain El
              Nino, and the  coupled system finds itself in an oscillatory state, it is El
              Nino that regulates the tropical maximum SST. The PI will test his hypothesis
              using two coupled models, a simple coupled model for the tropical Pacific
              region and the NCAR CSM TOGA model (NCAR CCM3 coupled to a fine resolution
              tropical Pacific basin model). The work will also address the issue of whether
              El Ninos will become more energetic in response to global warming. The work is
              important because it will increase our understanding of interaction and
              feedback mechanisms  involving El Nino and tropical SSTs.
