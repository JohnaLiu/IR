Abstract    :
              This proposal will provide support for US scientists to participate in an
              international workshop designed to synthesize high-resolution data sets of
              climate and ocean change over the last glacial/interglacial cycle.  Emphasis
              diverse records, including an assessment of the effect of radiocarbon
              variability and identification of high-frequency cycles.
