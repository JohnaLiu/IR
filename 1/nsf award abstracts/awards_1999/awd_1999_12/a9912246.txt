This award supports the first year of a REU Site in Qingdao and
              in Dalian, China.  

The program will provide fifteen undergraduate students,
              with an emphasis on underrepresented groups, the opportunity to participate in
              an 11-week intensive program to gain research and international experience. 
              The students will learn about the process of conducting research through
              participation in large ongoing research projects in physical and environmental
              oceanography, coastal hydrodynamics, and offshore engineering.  Students will
              be matched with faculty mentors and will undertake self-contained research
              projects within the context of the larger research program.  Dissemination of
              the research results will be emphasized; all students will participate in
              research group meetings, prepare and present reports on their work at
              undergraduate research symposia, with the participation of Chinese graduate and
              undergraduate students. Host institutions in China include the Ocean University
              of Qingdao and Dalian University of Technology. 

Experience working with
              fellow students and colleagues in a research environment overseas will
              contribute to creating an internationally engaged and competitive science and
              technology workforce, and to fostering a global approach to science and solving
              environmental problems.
