Abstract    :
              In order to design and manufacture future generations of complex VLSI chips,
              this project explores new techniques for the physical design of integrated
              circuits and systems. This project focuses on (1) the development of
              interconnect planning algorithms that are essential to the change in design
              paradigm from gate-centric approach to interconnect-centric approach, (2) the
              development of circuit optimization methods using the transmission line delay
              model which give more accurate results than algorithms based upon the commonly
              used lumped circuit models, (3) the development of physical design algorithms
              which can anticipate errors to be introduced by the photo-lithography process
              in chip  manufacturing, and (4) the development of ultra-fast routing
              techniques for field-programmable chips suitable to be used in reconfigurable 
              computing where "on-the-fly" routing is needed in real-time.
