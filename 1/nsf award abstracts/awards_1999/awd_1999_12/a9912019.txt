This project will provide Alaska teachers and students
              opportunities to engage in original global change research and to promote
              global change education in Alaska.  Teachers and students in grades 5-12 will
              conduct large scale, long-term data collection and analysis. Teachers and
              students from rural school districts serving Alaska's five distinct native
              cultures (Yupik, Inupiaq, Aleut, Athabascan, and Tlingit/Haida) will
              participate.  Eighteen teachers per year will be trained in the GLOBE program's
              procedures.  The teachers will then be guided in expanding these studies to
              include locally significant observations and knowledge from local experts
              (which will include scientists and tribal elders).  The new research projects,
              for which students will collect and analyze data, include a tree growth /tree
              ring study, a lake and sea ice study, and a global change in growing seasons
              study.  Teachers will initiate research in the summer and continue the research
              during the academic year, staying in contact with scientist mentors via the
              Internet.  The proposed project will provide teachers and students the
              opportunity to conduct research locally and to translate scientific research
              into meaningful classroom activities.  Native observations relevant to the
              local environment will be used to motivate student interest in science, and to
              support and extend their awareness of global climate change.
