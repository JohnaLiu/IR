Title:           Reasoning about
              Specifications of Computation 


Computational systems are often given their
              meaning in terms of
operational semantics, and these, in turn, can be
              formalized in
meta-languages based on logics or type systems. 
              Specifying
operational semantics in such meta-languages allows formal
              results
about semantics to be derived by reasoning within the
              meta-language:
for example, type soundness for a programming language might
              be
derived as a formal consequence from the theories specifying typing
and
              evaluation semantics.  One challenge in developing a framework for
such
              reasoning is the proper treatment of induction when higher-order
abstract
              syntax, an elegant and declarative treatment of object-level
abstraction and
              substitution, is used to encode syntax.  Current
approaches to inductive
              reasoning requires that syntax be coded using
the first-order techniques of
              algebraic terms, which itself requires
clumsy encodings for binding and
              substitution.  A meta-logic that can
be used to reason inductively about
              judgments coded using higher-order
abstract syntax will be developed: this
              meta-logic will be an
extension of a higher-order intuitionistic logic that
              admits induction
and a notion of definition.  A prototype system that
              implements this
logic and uses it to reason about computations specified
              in
operational semantics will be developed.
