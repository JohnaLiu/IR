Abstract    :
              The North Atlantic Arc project explores the linkages between environment and
              social change in fisheries-dependent regions of the North Atlantic. Building on
              previous research that focused on the cod crises of the late 1980s and early
              1990s, the project involves comparative analysis of data on recent
              oceanographic, biological, and socioeconomic changes affecting communities in
              Iceland, Newfoundland, Norway, and Greenland. The research has four goals: (1)
              document changes in fisheries-dependent societies; (2) construct a detailed
              picture of common patterns and regional differences in the dynamics of
              human-environment interactions; (3) explore hypotheses about individual,
              community, and enterprise adaptations to large-scale environmental change; and
              (4) develop empirical knowledge and models for evaluating possible policy
              responses.
