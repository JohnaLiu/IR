Abstract    :
              This research project explores an emerging and potentially
important area of
              distributed computing: interactive distributed
applications that involve
              mobile users with disparate network
connections and computing devices. 
              Specifically, the project
addresses the design of group communication
              protocols for
reliable multicasting, event synchronization, and
              leadership
control.  Key issues include how such protocols adapt to
              network
dynamics produced by mobile nodes and how they
              accommodate
performance differences among network connections and
              hardware
platforms.  The project investigates the integration of
              three
host-level techniques to support group communication: enhanced
network
              interface card functionality, new operating system
services, and
              user-level/proxy-based protocols.  In addition to
analysis and simulation, the
              project involves extensive
experimentation on a research testbed.  Expected
              results include:
new protocols and implementation techniques for use by
              software
developers; performance data on the merits and deficiencies
              of
various development techniques; and a framework for developing
and testing
              new applications.  On a broader scale, improving the
underlying support for
              interactive distributed applications
enhances their performance and makes them
              more accessible to
domains such as education, science, and public safety.
