Abstract    :
              The past rapid emergence of optical microcavity devices, such as Vertical Cavity
              Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) [1] can be largely attributed to the high
              precision over the layer thickness control available during semiconductor
              crystal growth.  High reflectivity mirrors can be grown with sub-nanometer
              accuracy to define high=Q cavities in the vertical dimension.  Recently, it has
              also become possible to microfabricate high reflecti-vity mirrors by creating
              two- and three-dimensional periodic structures.  These periodic "photonic
              crystals" can be designed to open up frequency bands within which the
              propagation of electromagnetic waves is forbidden irrespective of the
              propagation direction in space and define photonic bandgaps [2,3].  When
              combined with high index contrast slabs in which light can be efficiently
              guided, microfaricated two-dimensional photonic badgap mirrors provide us wit
              the geometries needed to confine light into extremely small volumes [4,5].  2-D
              Fabry-Perot resonators wit hmicrofabricated mirrors are formed when defects are
              introduced into the photonic bandgap structure.  It is then possible to tune
              these cavities lithographically by changing the precise geometry of the
              microstructures surrounding the defects.  Surprisingly, we have found that
              small cavities consisting of single defects in a two-dimensional photonic
              bandgap crystal can still exhibit high Q values, and we have calculated, by
              finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling, Qs in the range of 25,000 [6]. 
              When real cavities are measured in absorbing semiconductor material, Q values
              ain excell of 1500 are measured.  We have shown, as part of our previous NSF
              contract, that these high Qs make it now possible to define microcavity lasers
              [7] which functio at room temperature [8], with mode volumes as small as 2.5
              (l/2nslab)3, or 0.03 um3 in InGaAsP emitting at 1.55 um.
