Abstract    :
              This research develops advanced methodologies and tools to enable the design of
              low-energy embedded system-on-nanochips for future wireless appliances. A
              system-level power analysis technique is developed which considers the effects
              of wireless protocols, architectural choices, and nanometer technologies on the
              energy consumption of the hardware, software, and RF components of a wireless
              embedded nanochip. Since adaptive on-chip communication is fundamental to such
              heterogeneous component-based nanochips, analysis and optimization techniques
              are developed for low-energy on-chip communication architectures and protocols.
              Static and adaptive analysis and management techniques are developed to extend
              the battery life of the mobile systems. The techniques are being applied to the
              design of an adaptive single-chip radio that is being developed to enable
              wireless multimedia communications.
