Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is the quantitative analysis of
              
receptor-mediated cytotoxin trafficking dynamics in order to 
develop a
              highly selective method for treating diseases by 
targeted drug delivery.  The
              project outlines a plan for 
quantitatively assessing the effect of targeting
              molecules on the 
transport of toxins to the interior of animal cells.  This
              
project continues the general theme of using peptides to modify 
cellular
              processing of immunotoxins.  Specifically, using 
endocytosis to import drugs
              in tandem with endosomal 
membrane-disrupting peptides is proposed as a means
              for augmenting 
the delivery of a therapeutic to its intracellular target
              (e.g. 
ribosomes).
