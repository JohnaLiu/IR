Abstract    :
              In the summers of 2000, 2001 and 2002, the University of Tennessee Mathematics
              Department will sponsor a "Research Experiences for Undergraduates" program.  
              Each summer, ten undergraduate students will spend 8 weeks in this program,
              working on research projects with faculty members.  Our approach is based on
              "one student with  one advisor."   Two of the students will work at Oak Ridge
              National Laboratory for their projects.  There will be two short courses and a
              faculty seminar for the students, in addition to the research projects.  The
              students will give practice talks and as a finale, talks at the end of the
              program on their projects.   This program is funded by the National Science
              Foundation and the UT Science Alliance.
