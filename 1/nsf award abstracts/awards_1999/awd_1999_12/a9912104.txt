The "National Conference and Other Activities Supporting the
              Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching Program"
              project will provide training and information for state-level coordinators of
              the PAEMST program. This support will take the form of a yearly conference, a
              proceedings booklet and a handbook.  The project will serve the 53 state or
              judicatory coordinators.   The annual conference will review and refine the
              program's operational procedures and develop one or more components of
              state-level management of the program.  Issues and topics that will be
              addressed are the quality of applications, the use of rubrics for consistent
              scoring and rating of applications, appropriate strategies for recognition and
              utilization of awardees at the local and state levels, and increasing the
              applicant pool with major stress on minority applicants.
