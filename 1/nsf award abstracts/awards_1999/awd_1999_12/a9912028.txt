Abstract    :
              The preponderance of the evidence points to an African origin for anatomically
              modern humans with subsequent expansion of those original modern humans in
              Africa and eventual migration out of Africa to the rest of the world.  That
              migration out of Africa was limited to a relatively small number of individuals
              leading to a founder effect observed today in all populations outside of
              Africa.  The effect is manifested as (1) an increase in the amount and
              molecular extent of linkage disequilibrium, (2) a decrease in genetic variation
              of all non-African populations compared to African populations, and (3) as a
              progressive subsetting of genetic variation with increasing distance from
              Africa across EurAsia and then the Americas from north to South America.  The
              scientific aim of this proposal is to determine the nature and magnitude of the
              out-of-Africa founder effect in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia by
              discovering and characterizing normal genetic variation in African populations
              and analyzing the frequency and disequilibrium differences for this variation
              between African and non-Africans.
