Abstract    :
              This project addresses the origin of intraplate volcanic ridges - often called
              cross-grain anomalies - located on the Pacific plate.  Suggestions for the
              origin of these ridges include small-scale confection rolls, lithospheric
              boudinage, and small plumes resembling mini-hotspots that originate in the
              upper mantle.  Two neighboring intraplate ridges will be studied.  Measurements
              will include ocean-bottom seismometer observations of mantle structure, a
              seismic refraction/reflection profile of crustal structure,  micro- earthquake
              recordings, extensive geochemical probing of the melting conditions and
              composition of the mantle, radiometric dating of the timing of volcanc
              activity, and mapping of bathymetry, seafloor sidescan reflectivity, sediment
              thickness, and gravity and magnetic anomalies.
