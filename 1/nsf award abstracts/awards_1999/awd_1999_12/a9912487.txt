This grant continues a series of annual conferences on
              macroeconomics. These conferences, which began in 1986, have made a significant
              contribution to the testing of empirical implications of new theories as well
              as the use of relevant theory to analyze policy issues of current interest. The
              conference series will continue to encourage the writing of empirically
              oriented papers by both established and promising young economists. In
              addition, the series will continue to serve as a forum for communication among
              economists from the different schools of macroeconomics. The annual conference
              volume has become a widely cited and influential research reference.
