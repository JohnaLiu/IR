Abstract    :
              Efficient T-cell activation requires two signals, one emanating from the
              antigen-specific T-cell receptor, and the other from the CD28 cell surface
              receptor.  The net result of these two signals is the up-regulation of
              cytokines and other molecules required for efficient T-cell expansion.  While
              analysis of CD28 signals has revealed roles for Lck (a member of the Src family
              on non-receptor tyrosine kinases) and ITK (a member of the Tec family of
              protein tyrosine kinases), there remain significant gaps in knowledge on how
              CD28 activates these two kinases.  The overall aim of the present project is to
              determine the molecular interactions responsible for activation of ITK by
              CDC28.  The hypothesis is that CD28 regulates ITK by the concerted action of
              Src family kinases and the control over the recruitment and binding of ITK to
              CD28.  This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: (1) to
              identify the domains of ITK required for its efficient activation by CD28, and
              conversely (2) to determine the specific residues within CD28 required for
              activation of ITK.  The approach will be to express deletion and other
              mutational constructs of the two proteins in a B-cell line that lacks
              endogenous CD28 and Tec kinases.  The information to be gained will
              significantly expand the knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of the Tec
              family of protein kinases.
