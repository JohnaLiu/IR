This award provides funding to initiate a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Alaska
              Southeast (UAS) Juneau on the behavioral ecology of invertebrates, fish, birds
              and marine animals in Alaska. The PI will pair 8-10 undergraduate students with
              researchers to provide them with opportunities to conduct biological field
              research during a 10-week summer internship. Special efforts will be made to
              recruit Native Alaskans to this program.
