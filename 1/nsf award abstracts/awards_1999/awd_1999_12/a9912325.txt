Abstract    :
              Lafayette College's Undergraduate Research Project is an 8-week summer program
              in which undergraduates investigate open research problems in Mathematics. 
              Over the past 10 years, more than 75 students have
participated in the
              program, working in small groups directed by individual faculty members. Many
              participants have published papers and presented talks at research conferences
              based on their work at Lafayette.  The three topics of focus during the Summer
              of 2000 are Combinatorics (polynomials and graphs), Geometry (groups and
              symmetries) and Applied Mathematics (modeling swimming in fish).
