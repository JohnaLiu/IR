Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at the Colorado School of
              Mines (CSM) will provide a six-week program of Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) during each of the summers of 2000, 2001, and 2002.  The
              REU program will be modeled  after the department's highly successful Field
              Session,
in which, over a six-week period, students are expected to apply
              their knowledge from course work and to venture into new concepts while solving
              challenging applied problems in the mathematical and computer sciences.

Each
              REU summer session will involve eight students, two CSM students and six from
              other universities.  The students will work on projects of interest in the
              department and the university that will serve as an introduction to some of the
              research that is being conducted at CSM in the mathematical and computer
              sciences.  The projects are in the areas of numerical analysis of differential
              equations,  wavelets, computational finance, computational mechanics, symbolic
              computation, networking and dynamical systems.

Some local companies have
              expressed interest in the proposed projects and their opinions will be
              solicited in defining the projects more precisely. A growing national concern
              is the diminishing number of students who pursue graduate education in science
              and mathematics.  The primary goal of the REU program will be to introduce
              gifted  undergraduate students to the joy and excitement of discovery that
              comes from participating in a vibrant research program, with the hope that some
              will be sufficiently intrigued to consider pursuing graduate studies in our
              department.
