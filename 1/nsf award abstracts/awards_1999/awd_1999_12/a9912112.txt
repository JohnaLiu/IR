Abstract    :
              	Pre-election bargaining among ambitious leaders in the Russian Federation
              influences both the nature of choice presented to voters at the ballot box and
              the outcome of national elections.  As these winners shape subsequent
              institutional changes, the effects of elite wrangling prior to elections are
              likely to be felt far longer than their actual terms in office.  Similarly,
              elite bargaining within the structure of the party system also influences the
              nature and durability of linkages between voters and their representatives. 
              With funding, this project surveys party functionaries across Russia in
              November 1999 to assess the effects of the pre-election bargaining process on
              party cohesion and party system formation at this critical juncture in Russia's
              nascent democracy.  These elite-level data provide an important complement to
              the mass-level studies conducted at the same time.  Elite data provide a means
              to test propositions regarding the capacity of party organizations to compete
              on a programmatic basis.  Finally, the additional data allow the testing of
              propositions about the effects of institutional structures (such as mixed
              electoral laws and premier-presidential systems) on party system formation.
