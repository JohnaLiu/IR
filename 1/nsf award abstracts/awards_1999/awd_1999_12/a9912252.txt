Abstract    :
              Summer Undergraduate Research in Nuclear Physics at the Triangle Universities
              Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL).
The Duke REU program, which is funded by the
              National Science Foundation (NSF), TUNL, and Duke University will provide
              undergraduate students with a realistic and active research experience in
              nuclear science and related fields through the completion of a self-contained
              10-week research project.  The students will collaborate with faculty,
              postdoctoral and predoctoral research staff at TUNL, which is located on the
              campus of Duke University.  Founded in 1965 as a joint venture between Duke
              University, North Carolina State University, and The University of North
              Carolina at Chael Hill, TUNL is one of the largest, university based nuclear
              physics facility in the U.S.  Undergraduates, preferably sophomores or juniors,
              who have completed an introductory physics course and have completed or are
              taking an advanced physics course, are encouraged to apply.  Dates for the 2000
              program are from Monday, June 5 until Friday, August 11th.
