Abstract    :
              This award provides renewed funding for a summer internship program at the
              Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), Columbia University. The goal of the
              summer internship program is to teach undergraduates about the process of doing
              scientific research, to expose the students to a wide range of research topics,
              to facilitate interactions with a wide diversity of fellow science students and
              researchers, to expose the students to a range of career options, and to teach
              the use of database software. LDEO pairs each student with a LDEO senior
              researcher. Students develop research projects, conduct data analysis and
              present final results of the project. Use of large computer databases and the
              extensive computer systems available at LDEO is an important component of the
              research conducted by all the interns. In addition, LDEO organizes a lecture
              series, including panel discussions on ethics in science.
