Abstract    :
              The 2000 REU Physics Summer Program at Southwest Research Institute will allow
              students to participate in research programs in space physics, astrophysics,
              optics, auroral and magnetospheric physics, plasma detector development,
              atmospheric physics, astronomy, and planetary science.  Students will be
              selected nationally with preference given to those entering their senior year
              in physics and who reflect the gender and ethnic demographics of San Antonio,
              Texas.  Students will attend a ten-week summer program to develop skills for
              solving research problems, participate in seminars for career exploration, and
              observe, and participate in on-going research projects.  SwRI staff actively
              participate in solar system exploration through basic modeling and theoretical
              research, use ground-based optical and radio observatories, and through
              involvement in various space missions.  Interaction with SwRI mentors will be
              on a one-to-one basis for individual research and skills development.  Students
              will experience first hand the advance of science from recognizing current gaps
              in knowledge to proposing and carrying through new experiments to analyzing the
              resulting data.
