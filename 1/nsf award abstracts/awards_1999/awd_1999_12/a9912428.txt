Abstract

There have been interesting recent results on the
              connection between pseudo-randomness and fault-tolerance. This project
              investigates these connections further.
In psudo-randomness, the project
              investigates extractors, derandomizing space-bounded computations, pseudorandom
              generators for combinatorial rectangles and pseudorandom permutations. Each
              item on the list has an application to the following item. In fault-tolerance,
              the project investigates randomized computation in the perfect infomation and
              cryptographic models, and aspects of error-correcting codes related to
              extractors.
