This award to Oregon State University in collaboration
              with University of Washington will provide support to test instrumentation for
              oceanographic research, specifically a seafloor drilling system, PROD, that if
              successful will allow sampling of sediments to depths greater than 100 meters
              subbottom with minimal disturbance in a variety of water depths and substrates.
               The system, built and operated by Benthic Geotek, Ltd., is designed to operate
              from a variety of multipurpose oceanographic research vessels, substantially
              increasing opportunities for acquisition of drilled material, which is
              presently accessible to most US marine researchers only via the Ocean Drilling
              Program drillship JOIDES Resolution.  The PROD system uses fiber-optic
              technology to control a bottom-mounted drilling system, and it includes
              capability to use hydraulic piston coring, a technique to acquire samples with
              little disturbance in unconsolidated sediments, as well as rotary drilling,
              which allows penetration of harder sediments and rock.  The testing supported
              here will be the first time the system is operated in deep water, as well as
              its initial operation from a US academic research vessel.  Any samples obtained
              during the test program will be archived at Oregon State University for future
              investigation by interested researchers.
