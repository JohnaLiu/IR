Abstract    :
              9912016

This collaborative project consists of a variety of analyses of the
              
dynamics of the Sub-Antarctic Front (SAF) based primarily on data 
collected
              during the recent Sun-Antarctic Flux Dynamics Experiment 
(SAFDE).  The
              analyses will address: the structure of mean circulation 
features; mass and
              heat transports through the SAFDE region; zonal 
momentum and vorticity
              budgets; mesoscale variability in the SAFDE 
region; the vertical structure of
              meanders of the SAF; and cross-frontal 
transport.  In situ data from SAFDE
              will be combined with remotely 
sensed data for the region, particularly
              altimeter data.  A comparison 
will be made between the structure and
              variability of the SAF observed 
during SAFDE and the SAF exhibited in recent
              GCM simulations.
