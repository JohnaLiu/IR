Abstract    :
              The vision of this proposed work is to create more versatile robots by using
              self-reconfiguration: hundreds of small modules will autonomously organize and
              reorganize as geometric structures to best fit the terrain on which the robot
              has to move, the shape the object the robot has to manipulate, or the sensing
              needs for the given task. To create flexible, robust, and autonomous robotic
              systems capable of such applications, a fundamental goal of this research is to
              develop a science-base for self-reconfiguring robotics.  This is a considerable
              challenge, which we propose to meet through (1) new designs for reconfigurable
              systems and (2) new ideas on algorithmic planning and control that can confer
              autonomous reconfigurability.  This kind of reconfigurable robotics science
              will greatly enhance the autonomous capabilities of distributed robot
              systems.

More specifically, the main goal for this proposed work is to
              develop a general algorithmic theory for self-reconfiguration, focused on (1)
              developing a theoretical basis for self-reconfiguration; (2)
developing
              centralized and distributed algorithms for self-reconfiguration planning; (3)
              developing locomotion algorithms that use self-reconfiguration and maintain the
              dynamic stability of the structure; and (4) developing applications of
              self-reconfiguration planning to self-repair. In addition, we plan to develop
              experiments to test these algorithms on a specific self-reconfiguring robot
              designed in our lab called The Crystal Robot. The experiments will be focused
              on general self-reconfiguration and its applications to
versatile locomotion
              and self-repair.
