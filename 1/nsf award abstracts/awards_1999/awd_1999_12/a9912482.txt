Abstract    :
              Highly Flexible Structures (HFSs) are designed to undergo large displacements
              without plastic deformation under normal operation conditions. HFSs have been
              used in many mechanical systems, civil structures, aerospace vehicles, and
              large space structures to satisfy space limitations, provide special
              mechanisms, and/or reduce structural weight. However, today's HFSs are very
              often built by trial and error and full-size testing. The objectives of this
              project are: (1) to derive and add new geometrically exact structural elements
              into the nonlinear finite-element code GESA for performing simulation-based
              design, analysis, and optimization of highly flexible isotropic and composite
              structures; (2) to derive efficient numerical methods for nonlinear static and
              dynamic analyses of HFSs; (3) to develop a MATLAB toolbox having graphical
              input and output for iteration of design, analysis, and dynamic animation; and
              (4) to perform experiments and establish an adequate database of post-buckling
              characteristics of HFSs and to derive guidelines for designing HFSs. This work
              is important for advancing the knowledge of nonlinear statics and dynamics of
              HFSs and for designing HFSs. This work will solve critical modeling issues,
              develop accurate modeling techniques for the design and analysis of HFSs, and
              provide an efficient tool for performing virtual experiments and rapid
              prototyping of HFSs.
