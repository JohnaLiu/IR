The University of Pennsylvania provides opportunities for
              undergraduate research through a multidisciplinary Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The REU Site is hosted by the Laboratory for
              Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM), the home of the Materials Research
              Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University of Pennsylvania.  The
              MRSEC includes over sixty faculty from nine departments; this pool of faculty
              serves as research mentors to the REU students. 

Fifteen undergraduate
              students are recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week research experience
              in the science and engineering of materials, with a recruitment focus on
              members of underrepresented groups.  In addition to working in individual
              research projects, REU participants attend weekly lectures on materials
              research as well as on-campus social activities
