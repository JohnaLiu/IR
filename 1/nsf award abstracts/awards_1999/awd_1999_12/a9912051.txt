Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the relation between thunderstorm electrification and
              the microphysical and kinematic properties of clouds as observed during STEPS
              (Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study) planned for the
              early summer of 2000 in western Kansas.  Data from aircraft, radar, sounding
              balloons, and a lightning-mapping network are employed.   Special attention is
              directed to storms that exhibit predominant intra-cloud lightning or positive
              cloud-to-ground lightning.  These kinds of anomalous lightning appear to be
              associated with severe thunderstorms and may be indicators of storm severity.  
              Examples of specific studies include (1) relating radar storm structure, large
              hail, and tornadoes to the production of positive cloud-to-ground lightning;
              (2) determining the role of large hail in storm electrification; (3) evaluating
              mechanisms that have been proposed to explain anomalous lightning.  This
              project will lead to a better understanding of storm electrification and to new
              ways of monitoring and predicting storm intensity.
