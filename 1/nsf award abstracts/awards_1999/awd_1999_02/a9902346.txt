Tropical fungal endophytes represent a novel system for
              exploring symbionts as mediators of plant resistance to pathogens. This study
              will investigate the previously undescribed diversity of tropical fungal
              endophytes and their interactions in a forest plant-pathogen system. Fungal
              endophytes, the diverse, asymptomatic Ascomycetes that inhabit aerial plant
              tissues, are remarkably rich in the leaves of tropical trees. Given that
              endophytes are heterotrophs and likely exert a cost upon the host, and that
              tropical trees are well-defended chemically against a diversity of fungi, why
              do tropical trees harbor such a richness of fungal endophytes? This
              dissertation research will test the hypothesis that endophytes act as
              mutualists by enhancing host plant resistance to fungal pathogens. At Barro
              Colorado Island, Panama, endophyte communities on Trichilia tuberculata
              (Meliaceae), a common canopy tree will be quantified and compared to other host
              tree species. In vitro assays will assess the influence of endophytes on the
              growth and survival of the undescribed Ascomycete that causes shot-hole disease
              in T. tuberculata, while in vivo growth chamber experiments will assess the
              costs and benefits of endophyte infection in the presence and absence of the
              pathogen. This study will enhance our understanding of both
              host-symbiont-pathogen interactions and fungal biodiversity.
