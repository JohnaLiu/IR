There has
              been an accumulation of evidence that has demonstrated that carnivorous
              arthropods, primarily parasitic wasps, locate herbivores by orienting to
              damage-induced volatile compounds that are released from plants that are preyed
              upon.  These compounds appear to be generated by plants de novo in response to
              herbivore saliva.  The compounds released may be quite specific.  Previous
              investigations of this phenomenon have been restricted to laboratory conditions
              leaving room for speculation on its ecological relevance.  This project will
              consider ecological issue directly by 1)  trapping and analyzing
              damage-specific volatile materials in the field, 2)  measuring the incidence of
              parasitism of herbivores on volatile-emitting and non-emitting plants and 3) 
              evaluating the costs and benefits that plants incur at various levels of
              volatile production and parasitoid attraction, under various levels of
              herbivory.
