Abstract    :
              This is a proposal from Corporation for National Research to hold a workshop to
              capture community input and to produce a publicly available report summarizing
              visions as to the future of NSF's Advanced Network Infrastructure programs
              following the present vBNS generation. This is an essential part of the NSF
              planning process and the information gathered and published will be extremely
              helpful to NSF and the R&E community at large. The Advanced Network
              Infrastructure program has a number of important constituent groups that should
              be consulted as a part of a post-vBNS planning activity. These groups include
              at least the following sectors: university CIOs and administrators, the general
              science and university research community, the computer and networking science
              research community, industry, and those involved with the Partnerships for
              Advanced Computational Infrastructure (PACI). This Corporation for National
              Research proposal will allow us to cover the industry community.
