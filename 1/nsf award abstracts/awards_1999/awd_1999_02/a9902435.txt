This is an experimental and modeling research program on
              nonequilibrium phase formation and stability in ball-milled metal powders. 
              Recent experiments demonstrate the complex behavior that results from a
              coupling between the evolution of phases and effects of mechanical behavior. 
              In order to gain greater understanding of this subject the influence of sample
              hardness and milling parameters on the effective thermodynamics of metastable
              alloys is investigated quantitatively.  The main alloy selected for this study
              is nickel-silver.  Characterization methods include x-ray diffraction,
              calorimetry, nanoindentation hardness measurements, and transmission electron
              microscopy.  Nanoscale composition variations are investigated by a combination
              of analytical and high-resolution electron microscopy, taking advantage of
              state-of-the-art facilities.  The experimental results are compared with
              predictions based on (1) models of effective thermodynamics and diffusion
              enhancement by plastic strain, and (2) quantitative data on grain size
              evolution during ball milling of elemental iron.

This research
              contributes to basic knowledge in the broad field of externally forced systems,
              overlapping with materials science, physics, chemistry and other disciplines. 
              Significant progress is anticipated in understanding the atomistic aspects of
              phase formation by ball milling.  Although the complexity of the ball milling
              process makes this fundamental study difficult, the knowledge derived on phase
              and microstructure design should result in significant practical benefit.
