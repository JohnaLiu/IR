This is a one year cooperative project between Dr.
              Yuansheng Li of the Chinese Polar Research Institute and Dr. Jihong Cole-Dai of
              Ohio State University to study the signal of the 1991 Pinatubo eruption from
              the Zhongshan-Dome A area, Antarctica. This project can provide samples from an
              area about which we have very little information and provide a training
              opportunity to the scientists who may not yet have the analytical capacity to
              obtain the full range of measurements from such a project.  The P.I. has the
              proven ability to carry out this research from an institute which excels in
              this type of study.  This project is jointly supported by the Chinese National
              Natural Science Foundation and the National Science Foundation.
