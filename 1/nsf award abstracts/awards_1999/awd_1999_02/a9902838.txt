Abstract    :
              	Dr. Yanai and his colleagues seek to clarify the relationship between cumulus
              convection and large-scale atmospheric motion in the tropics.  The principal
              methodology is to conduct diagnostic analyses of observations using, in this
              case, the data obtained during the TOGA-COARE experiment in the tropical
              Pacific.  The three major components of the project are:  (1)  an examination
              of the role of cumulus convection in the maintenance of the Madden-Julian
              oscillation (MJO) by quantitatively evaluating the terms of the perturbation
              kinetic energy and available potential energy equations;  (2)  a study of the
              nature of coupling between convective heating and the large-scale motion using
              statistical analysis of basic modes of cumulus heating and drying and their
              association with the MJO and other tropical wave disturbances;  and (3) a
              combined analysis of the large-scale momentum budget residual and modes of
              mesoscale convective organization to advance parameterization of cumulus
              transport of momentum.

	Understanding the relationship between the cumulus
              clouds and the larger scale has eluded researchers for many years.  It is
              critical to the development of numerical models that can adequately simulate
              and forecast global weather and climate.  Dr. Yanai's research may provide some
              of the necessary insights to advance knowledge in this area.
