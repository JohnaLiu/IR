A recent study of small earthquakes at Parkfield, CA, has
              found that the stress drop decreases with increasing magnitude (Nadeau and
              Johnson, 1998).  One hypothesis that can explain this observation is that the
              fault plane is locked by a fractal array of asperities, such that the number of
              asperities per unit area decreases with increasing area thereby reducing the
              apparent stress drop for larger events. This hypothesis is supported by the
              pair correlation function of the hypocenters, which were found to be consistent
              with a 2-D Cantor dust of asperities (Sammis et al., 1998). This proposal will
              further investigate the geometry, source, and mechanical significance of
              hierarchical fractal structures in fault zones.  The project will further
              analyze Parkfield seismic data to determine if the spatial and temporal
              distributions as a function of  magnitude are also consistent with a Cantor
              dust hypothesis.  As to the source of the fractal hierarchy, we have formulated
              three hypotheses 1) the fault is locked by asperities which have a hierarchical
              fractal structure, 2) the fault is locked by "grain bridges" in the gouge zone
              which have a hierarchical fractal structure, and 3) earthquakes occur on a
              nested hierarchy of shear localizations.  A series of laboratory investigations
              are planned to test each hypothesis.  A primary objective is to try to identify
              the conditions under which discrete hierarchical fractal structure emerges in
              shear deformation.
