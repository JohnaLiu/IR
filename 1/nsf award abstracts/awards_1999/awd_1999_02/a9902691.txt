Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the transport of stratospheric ozone at polar
              latitudes in the northern hemisphere by collecting and analyzing data from the
              Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research (ALOMAR), situated in
              the Norwegian Arctic.  This site is ideally situated to observe the northern
              hemisphere polar vortex and vortex edge dynamics, as well as the associated
              ozone depletion phenomena. The Rayleigh-Mie-Raman lidar system at ALOMAR is
              capable of measuring stratospheric temperatures. The associated Doppler Wind
              and Temperature System measures horizontal and vertical wind velocities. The
              collocated stratospheric differential absorption lidar measures ozone and polar
              stratospheric clouds. Coordinated measurements using all these instruments will
              be carried out during the winter of 1999/2OOO in close coordination with the
              NASA-supported SOLVE (SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment) project,
              which will provide complementary data from aircraft and balloons.

The
              modeling component of the project will investigate the transport of
              stratospheric ozone in polar regions using the data obtained through this award
              and as input for a mesoscale Lagrangian transport model.  Of particular
              interest is the role of mesoscale dynamical processes, such as atmospheric
              gravity waves, in the evolution of arctic polar vortex winds and their role in
              redistributing ozone.
