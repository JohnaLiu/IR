Xenoliths from the Kamchatka sub-arc mantle exhibit diverse
              petrographic
characteristics that have been attributed to variable degrees
              of
metasomatism by slab fluids of diverse compositions, generated over a
              range
of P-T conditions. This study will involve geochemical analyses of
              50-60
petrographically well-characterized xenoliths, representing along-
              and
across-arc variations in the metasomatized Kamchatka arc mantle wedge.

isotope and PGE abundance measurements will be combined with major
              element
and lithophile trace element analyses to characterize the fluids
              released
to the mantle wedge during slab subduction, and to document the
              processes
of fluid-mantle interaction. The combined use of highly
              incompatible
elements with highly compatible elements will provide a unique
              perspective
on these processes. In addition, the extent of PGE mobility and
              the types
of PGE fractionations that occur during slab-mantle interactions
              will have
important implications regarding the origin of variable siderophile
              element
abundance patterns in mantle from other tectonic settings.
