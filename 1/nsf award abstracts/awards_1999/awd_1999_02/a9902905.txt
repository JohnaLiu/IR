Abstract    :
              

	Recent discovery of fossil terrestrial mammals in the relatively undeformed
              paralic and continental sediments of the lower Eocene Ghazij Formation,
              Baluchistan Province, Pakistan provides a unique opportunity to investigate the
              paleogeography and paleobiogeography of the critical region between
              Indo-Pakistan and Asia before final suturing.  This award supports an
              investigation of the geochronology, paleogeography, and paleobiogeography of
              the Ghazij Formation in order to test the hypothesis that the "modern" orders
              of mammals (primates, artiodactyls, and perissodactyls) originated on the
              Indo-Pakistan continent before collision and dispersed across the holarctic
              after collision.  The geochronology of the Ghazij will be evaluated using
              magnetostratigraphy since there are no known isotopically dateable horizons and
              preliminary paleomagnetic results suggest that many Ghazij facies are conducive
              to this methodology.  Paleogeography will be reconstructed using sandstone
              paleocurrent and provenance analysis in order to evaluate the location and
              composition of the source region for the fluvial sediments in the middle and
              upper Ghazij Formation.  Ghazij paleobiogeography will be evaluated by
              continued sampling of vertebrate faunas and comparison of these assemblages to
              similarly aged vertebrate faunas from Asia, Europe, and North America.  The
              coarse conglomerates and continental facies of the upper Ghazij Formation may
              represent the sedimentary response to initial Indo-Asian collisional
              deformation and thus could help resolve ongoing debates related to the timing
              and geometry of this important tectonic event.
