Diffusional phase transformations and solid-state reactions
              in stressed, multicomponent, multiphase systems are under investigation using
              theoretical, computational and experimental techniques.  At least one spatial
              dimension of the materials system is small.  Initial efforts are directed
              towards understanding the effects of system size, interfacial stress, and
              non-local compositional stress on microstructural evolution by focussing on
              phase decomposition in binary and ternary (Ag-Au-Cu) alloys in small systems of
              spherical and planar geometry.  These results provide a foundation to
              investigate the effect of a diffusion barrier on the microstructural evolution
              of solid-state reactions.  There are three main thrust areas: (1) development
              of a set of thermodynamic field equations and boundary conditions for
              describing microstructural evolution in small systems with reactive interfaces;
              (2) application of the field equations and boundary conditions to simulate
              microstructural evolution in small systems; and (3) experimental investigation
              of microstructural evolution in small particles (10 - 1000 nm in diameter) of
              ternary Ag-au-Cu alloys using analytical transmission electron
              microscopy.

The long-term viability of many technologically important
              systems depends on the microstructural stability of the materials comprising
              the system.  A common feature in the design of thin-film and electronic
              devices, composite materials, and nano-structural materials is the use of
              spatially contiguous phases of ever-decreasing, small spatial dimensions that
              are not in thermodynamic equilibrium.  There exists in these systems a strong
              thermodynamic driving force for interdiffusion and nucleation and growth of new
              phases at the interface between component materials.  These reactions can be
              significantly modified by the placement of a diffusion barrier between the
              reacting materials.
