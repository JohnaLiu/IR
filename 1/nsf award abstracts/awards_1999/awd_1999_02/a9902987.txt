Abstract    :
              	This award is one of two made to provide support for a collaborative research
              project.  The companion award is to Dr. Plumb, MIT (ATM-9813327).

	The
              project involves the development of a chemical transport model in isentropic
              coordinates.  Isentropic coordinates have the advantage of potentially better
              capturing the transport characteristics of the atmosphere because they
              represent surfaces of neutral buoyancy and, thus, are a more natural coordinate
              for transport.  The starting point is an existing chemical transport model, the
              MATCH model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  This
              model's vertical coordinate will be converted to an isentropic system and the
              sub-grid scale mixing and boundary layer mixing parameterizations modified
              accordingly.  It is expected that, in particular, the model will better capture
              the nature of the transport near the tropopause and thereby contribute to
              better understanding of stratospheric-tropospheric exchange processes.  The
              principal investigators will test the model's realism by comparing simulations
              of trace gas transport with other model results and with observations.

	This
              project is supported jointly by the Atmospheric Chemistry and Large-scale
              Dynamic Meteorology Programs.
