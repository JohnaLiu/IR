A shallow magnetic inclination has been reported in
              paleomagnetic studies of numerous tectono stratigraphic terranes distributed
              along Western North America.  These shallow inclinations have been interpreted
              as requiring significant northward translation since acquisition of the
              magnetic signature.  However, laboratory compaction studies as well or
              sedimentary rocks indicate that shallow inclinations in some kinds of
              sedimentary rocks result from compaction.  This project will examine this
              possibility for the Valle group in Baja Mexico that previously has been used to
              argue for significant northward translation.  Results should clarify the
              translation history of the peninsular Range terrane and demonstrate the role of
              inclination shallowing in sedimentary rocks.
