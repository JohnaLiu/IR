Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development and implementation of 
efficient
              algorithms for several problems involving optimal placement of 
polygonal
              annulus regions with respect to a set of points. The optimality 
criteria may
              be either maximizing the numbers of points contained by a 
fixed sized
              annulus, or minimizing the size of the annulus necessary to 
contain a fixed
              number of points. The annulus placement problems are 
motivated by
              applications in geometric tolerancing, mobile robot 
localization using range
              finding, and pattern matching problems arising in 
computer vision. We are
              interested in both scaled and offset annulus 
regions, translation and
              rotation, convex and simple polygons, and 
off-line and on-line variants of
              the problem.
