Most animals possess two sets of chromosomes, but many
              plants are polyploid and have four or more chromosome complements.  This
              research investigates the origins and ecological significance of polyploidy in
              the native wildflower Achillea millefolium.  A combination of laboratory,
              greenhouse and field experiments will examine (1) the frequency and causes of
              polyploid formation, (2) the effects of chromosome number on ecological
              characteristics and reproductive success in different environments, and (3) the
              role of polyploidy in creating and maintaining ecological and genetic
              diversity.  A novel aspect of the research is the use of first-generation
              "neopolyploids" to distinguish the effects of ploidy per se from other genetic
              factors.

Polyploids are common in nature, and often occupy unique ecological
              niches.  Most weeds and crop plants are polyploid.  In spite of their
              importance, the origins of polyploids are poorly known, as are the reasons for
              their ecological success and economic importance.  This study addresses these
              issues in a native wildflower, but is also relevant to other organisms.  Recent
              data from DNA sequencing projects suggest that many animals, including humans,
              are cryptic polyploids possessing three or four copies of each gene scattered
              through the genome.  Thus, polyploid research may provide insight into the
              genetic systems of a wide array of higher organisms.
