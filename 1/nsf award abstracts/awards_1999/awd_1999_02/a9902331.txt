Aphids are small insects that feed on plants.  A few aphid
              species are 'social': some individuals act as 'soldiers', self-sacrificially
              defending the colony by attacking predaceous enemies. In some species, soldiers
              are reproductively sterile; in some, soldiers will even attack and bite humans,
              much like ants, wasps and bees. It is not yet known why some aphids have these
              soldiers, whereas others do not.  For groups like wasps and bees, researchers
              have debated the relative roles of familial relatedness versus ecological
              factors (like predation and parasitism) in favoring sociality and cooperation.
              Aphids represent an independent and unexplored group within which to examine
              these issues. In a social aphid species in southern Arizona, individuals move
              between colonies, reducing the genetic relatedness within each colony. This
              project will utilize molecular tools to quantify relatedness within colonies
              and to look at the effects of genetic relatedness for social behavior. 

The
              results will contribute to our growing understanding of why a variety of
              animals have made the transition to cooperative societies. More broadly, the
              research will help to elucidate the relationship between dispersal, genetic
              variation, and behavior in social insects.  Social insect studies are important
              model organisms for developing and testing theories of sociality that are
              relevant to all social animals.
