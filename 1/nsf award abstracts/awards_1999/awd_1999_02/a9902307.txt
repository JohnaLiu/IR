Abstract    :
              Hermaphroditism is widespread in invertebrates, such as freshwater snails,
              flatworms, and barnacles.  Surprisingly little is known about hermaphroditic
              reproductive strategies.  Hermaphroditic species are those in which individuals
              have both male and female reproductive systems and can mate in either role. 
              The PIs do not understand the strategic tradeoff between investing energy in
              male versus female roles that allows an individual to reproduce optimally, i.e.
              produce the most possible offspring over its lifetime.  Preliminary studies on
              sea slugs indicate that body size is an important determinant of mating
              strategies: large animals tend to function as females more than small animals. 
              This study will develop a mathematical model to predict the best reproductive
              strategy for sperm-storing hermaphrodites of varying body sizes. Predictions of
              the model will be tested using a common sea slug, the California Sea Hare (an
              opisthobranch Gastropod), by observing matings in the field and conducting lab
              experiments.  In addition, DNA based paternity analysis will quantify how many
              offspring can be sired by mating in the male role given that individuals can
              mate several times and store the sperm received from several mates before
              egg-laying.

The findings of this project will provide new insights into the
              understanding of reproductive behavior and physiology, along with shedding
              light on why hermaphroditism is widespread in invertebrates, and also why
              nearly all opisthobranch Gastropods, like the California Sea hare, are
              hermaphrodites.
