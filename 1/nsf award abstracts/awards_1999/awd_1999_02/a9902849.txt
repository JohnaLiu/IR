Available data on ages, areas, thicknesses, and volumes of
              sedimentary rock on continents, and on ages and areas of sedimentary rock
              actually exposed at the Earth's surface, indicate that decrease in map area
              with increasing age takes place almost an order of magnitude faster than
              decrease in total sequence area or volume.  This difference reflects the fact
              that map area is "destroyed" both by erosion and burial by younger units,
              whereas total reservoir extent is only modified by erosion.  The difference
              however,
allows for direct estimation of decreasing intensity of cycling rate
              as a function of increasing sequence age.  At present, estimates of total
              reservoir size on all continents except Antarctica are adequate to discriminate
              eon-scale rates of destruction.  Conversely, data on areas and ages of exposed
              sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic reservoirs have only been coarsely
              determined, and significant improvement in the precision of these estimates can
              be accomplished with a modest amount of effort.
Therefore, we will compile a
              global database on areas and ages of exposed rocks from the most currently
              available geological maps of the Earth, and major continental land masses. 
              Many of these recently released compilations are in digital format and are
              amenable to quantitative evaluation using commercially available software
              packages.  Results of
these efforts will embody age-corrected assessment of
              epoch-scale rates of rock cycling on continental crust, as well as estimates of
              secular variation in cycling rate as a function of global eustasy, tectonic
              setting, and paleolatitude.
