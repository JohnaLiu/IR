Abstract    :
              Dense gases exhibit thermodynamic properties and gas dynamics behavior that can
              be significantly different from the low density (sp. gr.  10 -3) gases that are
              normally encountered.  The proposed workshop will provide a welcome opportunity
              to permit a wide range of researchers to interact and to clarify the issues of
              consensus and the issues to which attention should be directed.
