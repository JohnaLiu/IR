Abstract    :
              This action provides for the continuation of the lease of land for part of the
              staging base at Christchurch, New Zealand for the U.S. Antarctic Program
              (USAP).  The lease was established on August 3, 1988 between the Christchurch
              International Airport Limited (CIAL) and the United States of America, and was
              initially scheduled to expire on September 30, 1991.  Through a series of
              amendments, the lease was extended to September 30, 1998.  The U.S. Navy
              (Commander, Pacific Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command) was
              assigned responsibility for the lease for the United States  On April 1, 1998,
              the fourth amendment to the lease assigned responsibility for the United States
              from the Navy to the National Science Foundation.  

This lease is for land
              only on which sits buildings and property owned by the National Science
              Foundation.  While the Navy was responsible for the lease, NSF reimbursed the
              Navy for the lease cost, since the land was being used for the sole purpose of
              supporting the USAP.  NSF is negotiating to have the lease transferred from NSF
              to its support contract, Antarctic Support Associates (ASA).  Negotiations were
              not completed September 30, 1998.  CIAL has agreed to extend the current lease
              until negotiations are complete.  NSF has agree to make quarterly payments on
              the lease cost directly to CIAL until negotiations can be completed and a new
              lease between ASA and CIAL is executed.

First quarter costs for FY-1999 are
              $30,937 USD.  Based on my analysis of the lease negotiations and the
              recommendation of the NSF contracts office, I recommend this funding award.
