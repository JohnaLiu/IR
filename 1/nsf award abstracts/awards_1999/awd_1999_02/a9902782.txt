Very large, gravity driven surficial slumps develop
              deformational characteristics remarkably similat to those generated by
              tectonically driven crustal extension normal faults, yet their tectonic
              importance is dramatically different.  Uncertainty in origins of several large
              extensional features have historically complicated understanding of the
              tectonic deformation of areas such as the Basin and Range province of the
              western United States.  This project involves a comparison of the fault zones
              of large crustal-extending normal faults with those of large rootless slide
              blocks in an attempt to develop a set of criteria to discriminate between
              gravity or tectonic origins.  Results may provide a new tool for partitioning
              extension related and surficial deformation in geologically complex, highly
              extended terranes, and hence in assessing the magnitude of regional extension
              in such regions.
