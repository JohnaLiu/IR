Coexistence of intraguild predators, potential competitors
              that are also mutually predaceous, is rarely predicted by models despite its
              commonplace occurrence. One mechanism by which conflict may be minimized is
              spatial partitioning of habitat. Such zonation has been observed in a small
              shallow pond with four notonectid species - voracious insect predators which
              share resources and readily feed on each other. Conflict may be reduced by this
              partitioning, but these patterns exhibit seasonal and diel shifts in ways that
              could substantially endanger or enhance coexistence. In this dissertation
              research, field study will quantitatively confirm the preliminary observations
              presented here. Mechanisms leading to spatial partitioning and temporal changes
              will be investigated in experimental microcosms. Mid-season distributional
              shifts of juveniles may be a response to a decline in adult predators, allowing
              juveniles to complete development in a high-resource habitat. Conversely, diel
              shifts in species distribution increase potential for conflict by increasing
              nocturnal overlap. Diurnal and nocturnal diet of field-collected notonectids
              will be compared, using electrophoretic gut content analysis, to determine
              whether intraguild predation increases at night as expected. In addition, a new
              hypothesis for diel horizontal migration is proposed: profitability of
              spatially complex and open habitat is reversed at night for predators using
              both vision and mechanoreception.
