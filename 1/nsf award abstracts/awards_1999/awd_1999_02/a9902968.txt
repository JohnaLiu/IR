Comparison of strain accumulation and release a long relatively
              discrete, rapidly moving plate boundary fault zones has led to considerable
              insights into the dynamics of plate interactions in tectonic situation such as
              Japan and coastal California. However, less is known about dynamics of diffuse
              intraplate fault systems.  Ongoing investigations are providing measures of
              contemporary strain accumulation across the Basin and range of central and
              Eastern Nevada and this project will obtain a precise chronology of late
              quaternary strain release in the same area.  Comparison of the two date's sets
              should provide a test of how well this method can be applied to an intraplate
              system and should help understand the dynamics of Basin and Range faulting.
