Abstract    :
              

The Gordon Research Conferences on various scientific topics, are held every
              summer to discuss recent findings and current thinking.  Although participation
              is limited, the attendees usually consist of established scientists, young
              investigators who are making important contributions in these areas,
              postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.  They are usually held in small
              isolated New England towns away from other distractions, and are conducive to
              the free exchange of ideas.  Recently some conferences have also been held in
              Europe.  These conferences have a recognized value for presenting the latest
              advances in research and also for indicating the future trends in research. 
              The programs in the BIO directorate have given support for a number of years, 
              to various  Gordon Conferences which are relevant to the research their
              programs support. This award reflects the support of a number of programs in
              the directorate for various Gordon Conferences to be held in the Summer of
              1999.
