A central theme in ecology is to develop a better
              understanding of the factors and processes responsible for controlling the
              structure of local communities. One of the most widely studied interactions is
              predation, however the effect of predation on community structure is not well
              known. This study will compare the effects of ecological characteristics of
              predators and their prey assemblages on interaction strength. This will be done
              using two experiments. One experiment is designed to compare the effects of
              predators representing different taxonomies, foraging microhabitats and
              patterns of resource use (size of prey consumed) on a common prey assemblage.
              The second experiment is setup to determine if the keystone effect of a
              predator is dependent upon the relative abundances or degree of competitive
              asymmetry in the prey assemblage. This work should lead to a better
              understanding of what controls the strength of interactions between species,
              thus, leading to the development of theories predicting the structure of local
              communities.
