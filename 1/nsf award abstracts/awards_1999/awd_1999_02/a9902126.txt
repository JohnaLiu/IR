Dense gases
              represent a fluid medium that displays novel properties, e.g. a rare faction
              shock wave, and potentially important technological attribute.  Rankine cycle
              engines that exploit the non-classical behavior of these dense fluids are one
              example of the latter.  The PI and his collaborators have carried out important
              initial investigations of these phenomena.  The present award is to permit
              their construction and operation of a shock tube that will be used to
              investigate negative non-linearity in a single-phase vapor and to examine the
              properties of a rare faction shock wave.
