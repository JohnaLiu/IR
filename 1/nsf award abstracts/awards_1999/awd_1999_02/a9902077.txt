Abstract    :
              
    Chemical processes involving inorganic halogens and their influences on
              oxidation processes in the marine boundary layer (MBL) are believed to be
              important, but the rates of such processes are highly uncertain.  Halogen-atom
              precursors are thought to originate from reactions involving sea-salt aerosol,
              as evidenced by halide "deficits" in aerosol ionic balances.  This project is a
              collaborative study of halogen chemistry in marine air, involving researchers
              from the University of Virginia, the University of Hawaii, Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology, Max Planck Institute, NCAR and AOML/NOAA.  The field
              study will take place during September 1999 in Oahu, Hawaii.  Measurements will
              include HCl*, Cl*, Cl(total), ClO, BrO, IO, alkaline-reactive inorganic Br, O3,
              NMHC's, NO, NOx, NOy, CO, and major ion and bromine chemistry of
              size-segregated aerosols.  Data will be interpreted based on thermodynamic
              calculations and photochemical models.
