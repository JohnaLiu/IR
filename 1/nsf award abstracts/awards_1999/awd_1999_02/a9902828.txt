Orogenic processes at convergent plate boundaries
              involve surficial processes, possible extensional tectonics and uplift and
              exhumation of rocks in addition to the overall compressive tectonic setting. 
              How these processes interact and are apportioned in most convergent margins is
              problematic.  The research will investigate a well-developed trellis drainage
              pattern in the Alps that is thought to be a direct consequence of the
              extensional mechanism, with syn-convergent extension occurring normal to the
              convergent direction resulting in broadly folded foot walls and high angle
              brittle faults presumably created as the foot wall passes through a rolling
              hinge.  Differential erosion exploits the lows in the folds and the high angle
              faults resulting in the observed trellis pattern.  This project is a
              geomorphic, petrographic and structural study to test the concept of the origin
              of the trellis drainage pattern, and these data will be incorporated in a
              tectonic/geomorphic model.  Results should help apportion rock exhumation to
              tectonic extension and fluvial erosion in this and other constructional
              setting.
