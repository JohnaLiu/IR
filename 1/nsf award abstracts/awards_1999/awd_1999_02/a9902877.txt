Abstract    :
              



Primary and secondary metabolism intersect in the one-carbon (1-c) area
              with primary metabolism supplying most of the 1-c units and competing with
              secondary metabolism for their use.  This competition is potentially severe
              because plant secondary metabolism imposes hugh demands for 1-c units,
              especially methyl groups for the synthesis of lignin, alkaloids and
              osmoprotectant compounds such as glycine betaine and D-ononitol.  As many
              current metabolic engineering projects aim to change levels of these products,
              and hence methyl group demand, it is essential that one understands how 1-c
              metabolism is regulated so that one can successfully engineer the 1-c supply to
              match demand.  To do this requires skills in molecular biology, metabolic and
              analytical chemistry, in vivo NMR, and computer modeling.  These skills will
              come from five Principal Investigators (PIs) with complementary and overlapping
              expertise.  All PIs are used to doing interdisciplinary teamwork.
