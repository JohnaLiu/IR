The investigators will use a type of genetic marker
              (called microsatellite loci) that will enable them to distinguish parentage and
              kin relationships within an individually marked population of free-ranging
              lemurs, the White Sifaka. By establishing a causal relationship between
              individual reproductive success and socio-demographic factors (e.g. group size,
              age, social position), the researchers hope to provide a framework for
              understanding how these animals seek to maximize that success.

Evolution
              largely proceeds by differential survival and reproduction within a population.
               For too long, estimates of these parameters have remained elusive.  The
              discovery and use of microsatellite markers provides an efficient and
              non-invasive way to assess these parameters in wild populations.  Studies
              employing microsatellite markers can provide a more robust depiction of which
              environmental, social, and demographic factors impinge on individual viability
              and fecundity.  Such knowledge may then be used to both diagnose and manage
              animal population growth (with substantial conservation implications) as well
              as aid in the refinement of biological principles governing behavioral
              adaptation.
