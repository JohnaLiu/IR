The base of the lithosphere, the mechanically strong layer
              of tectonic plates, is typically 200-250 km deep beneath the older regions of
              continents.  Data from rocks entrained in volcanic lavas indicate that this
              thickness has been stable for over 2 billion years in some locations.  The PI
              will conduct a theoretical investigation the physics of why the lithosphere is
              this thick and has remained so over time. A supply of heat from below is needed
              to offset the heat lost upward by conduction to the surface. The model will
              consider two linked processes, which act to maintain this thickness: (1)
              small-scale free convection at the base of the lithosphere and (2) the transfer
              heat by stirring caused by the horizontal movement of overlying tectonic
              plates. Ponding of hot buoyant mantle plume material at the base of the
              lithosphere is a process that also supplies heat, and will be investigated in
              the model.  The PI's model will calculate the evolution of the geotherm with
              time and determine whether stable equilibrium lithospheric thicknesses exist. 
              Model results will be compared with observations.
