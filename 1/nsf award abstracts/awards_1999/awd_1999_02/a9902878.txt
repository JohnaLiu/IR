Abstract    :
              	This proposal pursues an older observation that the lyophilization of certain
              enzyme catalysts in the presence of highly ionic, non-buffering salts, e.g.,
              KCl, can increase the catalytic rate in non-aqueous systems by 3-4 orders of
              magnitude. This has been demonstrated primarily on subtilisin. The specific
              aims of the original proposal are:
                To elucidate the
              mechanism(s) of enzyme activation in organic solvents with salts
To extend the
              concept to a broad range of enzymes and reactions.  To utilize the activated
              enzymes for combinatorial biocatalysis.  In the revised and funded proposal,
              Aim 3 has been dropped and a more detailed examination of the mechanism and
              scope of the phenomenon has been added.
