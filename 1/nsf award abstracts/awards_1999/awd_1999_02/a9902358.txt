This award supports U.S.-Russian cooperative research on
              the effects of bowed stator blades on the flow in axial compressors.  The
              research effort will be headed by Dr. Daniel J. Dorney of Virginia Commonwealth
              University and Dr. Victor Saren of the Central Institute of Aviation Motors in
              Moscow.  This study expects to improve the efficiency of gas-turbine
              compressors through the use of (1) bowed airfoils, which are airfoils designed
              to reduce blade loadings near endwalls, and thus minimize secondary flows, and
              (2) airfoil clocking, which is adjusting the circumferential location of
              airfoils in adjacent rotating and non-rotating blade rows to reduce
              unsteadiness and total pressure losses.  The experimental portion of the
              program will be performed by scientists in Moscow, while the computational
              portions of the program will be undertaken by researchers at Virginia
              Commonwealth University, Texas A&M University, and Boston University.

This
              research in engineering fulfills the program objectives of bringing together
              leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine complementary efforts and
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
