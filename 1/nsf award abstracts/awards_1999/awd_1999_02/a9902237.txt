Abstract    :
              Travel and conference support for the speakers at the Forum "From Scientific
              Discovery to Nanotechnology of Tomorrow" in Santa Clara (CA), November 13,
              1998, is provided. This Forum is organized in conjunction with the 1998 Sixth
              Foresight Conference on Molecular Nanotechnology.  The Forum addresses the
              following critical issues for the current development of nanotechnology:
              interdependence and synergism between fundamental research and technology, the
              path from discovery to applications, and ways to facilitate and best utilize
              advances in nanotechnology.  The speakers are leaders in industry, academe and
              government.  Representatives from Kodak, Motorola, DOD, NASA, NNUN, as well as
              University of Tokyo, Princeton University, and Max-Plank Institute will
              contribute.  About 250 participants from US and abroad are estimated. This
              Forum aims to identify and stimulate the best approached to move fundamental
              discoveries from laboratory to industrial and health applications.  A brochure
              with the extended abstracts will be prepared for distribution at the meeting.
