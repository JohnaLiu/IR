The investigators will expand their continuously
              recording Global Positioning System (GPS) network on Kilauea volcano to better
              understand volcanic and seismic deformations.  Two GPS stations will be added
              in the epicentral region of the most recent large earthquakes, the largest of
              which was M7.2.  Annual measurements imply a change in the pattern of
              deformation at several sites prior to a M5.5 earthquake in June 1997.  The new
              stations will help constrain deformation rate changes within this nucleation
              zone.  The investigators will test whether the data collected before the June
              1997 earthquake can be explained by a decrease in slip-rate on the decollement
              beneath Kilauea.   Techniques will be developed to rapidly analyze the GPS data
              to determine near real-time estimates of deformation, and to model these data
              to better constrain seismic and magmatic processes.
