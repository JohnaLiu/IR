The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Lisa K. Fleischer
              with support for six months to work with Dr. Bill Cunningham at the Fields
              Institute for Research in the Mathematical Sciences at the University of
              Toronto in Canada.
This project will focus on the development of techniques to
              solve hard combinatorial problems in network design and routing; problems that
              arise in transportation, communication and security.  Examples of this include
              assigning airline crews to flights, scheduling automobile production processes,
              partitioning and clustering shipments of goods for transport, and designing
              telecommunication networks.  The techniques Dr. Fleischer will explore are
              those of approximation algorithms and of polyhedral combinatorics.  She will
              participate in the Fields Institute special semester devoted to these
              topics.
Dr. Cunningham is organizing this semester at the Fields Institute. 
              In addition to working with Dr. Cunningham, Dr. Fleischer will be interacting
              with Drs. Levent Tuncel, University of Waterloo and Dr. Michel Goemans from the
              University of Louvain, Belgium.
