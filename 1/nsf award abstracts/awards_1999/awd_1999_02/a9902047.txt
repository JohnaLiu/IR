The Exploratorium will develop "The Math Explorer Activity
              Book," a project designed to build interest in math among youth ages 11 to 14,
              particularly girls and minority youth; and to engage youth group leaders,
              parents, and caregivers in math outside the classroom.  The project includes a
              national campaign to raise public awareness among youth and adults of the
              critical difference that achievement in middle school-level mathematics makes
              in the life opportunities of students as well as to publicize a new book of
              math activities, the heart of the project.  The new book, tentatively titled
              "The Math Explorer," will describe how to do activities at home or in nonschool
              settings with common, inexpensive materials.  The experiences and activities in
              the book will give middle school-aged youth opportunities to see the relevance
              of mathematics to their lives and to experiment with math outside the social
              pressure of school.  After testing and evaluation, the Exploratorium will
              publish the book in collaboration with a commercial publisher for wide
              dissemination.
