DDIG: Physio-chemical and biological control over
              the fate of nitrogen and phosphorus in tropical soils

Our current
              understanding of the mechanisms regulating the binding of N and P in soils is
              incomplete. As a result, no regional or global scale modeling efforts to date
              have included phosphorus dynamics or abiotic nitrogen immobilization. The
              objective of this research is to develop a better understanding of how biotic
              and abiotic components of a system control the uptake of N and P, and of how
              biological and physio-chemical processes interact to regulate the turnover and
              availability of these nutrient pools. A combination of laboratory and field
              experiments will be used to determine the partitioning of these nutrients among
              soil solution, microbial biomass, and the soil mineral - soil organic matter
              pool in the Hawaiian archipelago. Understanding the mechanisms regulating these
              processes will enable scientists to improve models and thereby increase the
              accuracy of predictions of long-term ecosystem responses to fertilization,
              forest conversion, elevated N deposition, climate shifts, and other
              environmental changes.
