Investigations of
              bacterial speciation have been limited by techniques that are biased and
              limited in their abilities to resolve species.  Modern molecular techniques in
              microbiology have the potential, now, to be used for natural history studies
              with microorganisms that are parallel to those used for higher plants and
              animals.  This project would examine the influence of geographic isolation on
              the diversification of bacteria.  It would evaluate evolutionary and ecological
              patterns of thermophilic cyanobacteria by evaluating 16S rRNA gene diversity
              from geographically distant thermal sites.  Genotype of Synechoccus inhabiting
              hot springs in Yellowstone National Park will be compared with springs in New
              Zealand, Japan, and China as well as at Mt. St. Helens in the US.
