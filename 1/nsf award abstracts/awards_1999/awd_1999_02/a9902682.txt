We seek to determine the mechanisms and rates of metamorphic
              reactions by using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) to study
              porphyroblastic textures. Mechanisms of crystallization will be extracted from
              the X-ray CT data by means of statistical measures of the sizes and locations
              of crystals, electron-microprobe analysis of compositional zoning patterns in
              them, and comparison with the predictions of numerical simulations of
              crystallization under diverse kinetic controls. New numerical models will be
              constructed to approximate crystallization in nature more closely than was
              possible before, and these models will be fit to the CT data to constrain
              absolute reaction rates.  The principal objectives of the research are:  (1) to
              assemble a broad inventory of textural features in metamorphic rocks whose
              geologic settings makes them likely to reveal information about the effects on
              crystallization kinetics of temperature, pressure, fluid infiltration,
              deformation, heating rates, precursor grain size, internal diffusional
              competition, and interfacial-reaction rates; (2) to create models for numerical
              simulation of crystallization that capture the essential character of
              metamorphic reaction in each of these settings; and (3) to use those new
              methods of numerical simulation to interpret textural data, clarifying
              mechanisms of metamorphic reactions and quantifying the critical kinetic
              parameters that determine their rates.
