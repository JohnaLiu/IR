This project aims to understand the structural and chemical
              basis for the electrical properties and phase transitions in alkali and
              alkaline earth solid acid sulfates, selenates, and phosphates.  Because there
              exist numerous structure types of these compounds, all exhibiting varying
              extent and type of hydrogen bonding, and because they can be obtained as large
              single crystals from aqueous solutions, the systems will serve as excellent
              model compounds for the study of proton conductivity and ferroelectric phase
              transitions.  Characterization tools to be used include x-ray and neutron
              diffraction for structural studies, together infrared, thermal analysis,
              conductivity and dielectric measurements.

Structure-property studies
              aimed at optimizing and understanding the fundamental behavior of superprotonic
              conductors are directly related to a number of materials applications areas
              that include hydrogen and water sensors, fuel and steam cells, and high energy
              density batteries.  Also, ferroelectrics and related piezoelectrics and
              electro-optical materials, are used in a wide range of electronic devices from
              pressure sensors to optical shutters and modulators.
