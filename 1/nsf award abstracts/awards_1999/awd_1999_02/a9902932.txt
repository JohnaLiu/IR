Early stages of continental collision are difficult to study
              as the features they leave are subsequently severely overprinted, however early
              features are important as they likely guide later deformation by the
              inhomogenity they impose.  This project is aimed at documenting uplift and
              unroofing of the Alborz range of northern Iran, which is in the beginning
              stages of the collision between the Arabian peninsula and Iran which began in
              Pliocene time.  The work involves structural, magmatic, denudational and uplift
              history of the Alam Kuh area and associated isotopic geochronology and
              geochemistry.  Results are expected to shed light on the processes that occur
              early in continental collision, such as the synchroneity or diachroneity of
              widespread deformation and uplift following collision.
