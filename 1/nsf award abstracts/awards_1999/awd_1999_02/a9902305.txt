How do animals balance the need for defense against disease
              against other needs such as growth or reproduction?  One possibility is that
              one such costly effort is achieved by a trade-off with another. To investigate
              the role of such trade-offs, this research tests whether mounting an
              anti-microbial immune response is energetically costly, whether these costs
              affect the ability of individuals to survive and reproduce, and lastly, whether
              this proposed trade-off has a genetic basis. This research is being carried out
              using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, a model system for the study of
              genetics, life history, and insect immunity.  By comparing immune responses and
              measuring costs of immunity in flies that have been bred in the laboratory for
              specific genetic traits, the evolution of disease resistance can be measured. 
              

Parasites and disease are ubiquitous in natural populations, and parasites
              can decrease both the survival and reproductive ability of their hosts.  One
              might therefore expect evolution of strong defenses against pathogens, yet
              susceptibility to disease remains high in many different organisms.  One
              solution to this problem is that resistance is costly and trades off with an
              animal's ability to survive and reproduce.  This research will contribute to
              our understanding of the role that such trade-offs play in maintaining disease
              susceptibility.
