The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.
This award will provide support for a
              twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Eric P. Rubenstein to work with
              researchers at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in La Serena, Chile under
              the direction of Dr. Nick B. Suntzeff, and twelve months of support for a
              reentry year at Yale to work with Dr. Pierre Demarque.   Partial support for
              this project is provided by NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and their Stellar Astronomy
              and Astrophysics Program.
This project will involve the measurement of the
              mass to luminosity ratio of metal-poor stars.  These stars are considered to be
              benchmarks to allow extrapolations of cosmological significance.  Detailed
              measurement of their properties is not only interesting in stellar astronomical
              research but will have cosmological implications.  The observations will be
              made using the Southern Hemisphere telescopes in Chile.  While at Yale, Drs.
              Rubenstein and Demarque will make extensive comparisons with theoretical models
              and create new models compatible with the observations from Chile.
While in
              Chile, Dr. Rubenstein will be establishing collaborations with a variety of
              astronomers at CITO, as well as from the Universidad de Chile, such as Maria
              Teresa Ruiz and Jose Maza, who are active in stellar population work and
              supernovae studies.
