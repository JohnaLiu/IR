This study uses an experimental approach to explore a
              fundamental component of all metabolisms, the ribonucleoprotein RNase P. 
              Composed of a catalytically active RNA and a companion protein, RNase P is
              present in all organisms, albeit in different forms.  The investigators'
              objective is to understand the forces that have shaped the diversity of RNase
              P.  To do so, they have developed a system for in vivo evolution that allows
              them to introduce an RNase P from a different organism into the E.coli
              bacterium.  They will then be in a position to follow the evolution of this
              introduced RNase P in its new cellular environment, providing a direct glimpse
              into the evolution of single component of complex metabolisms.  This approach
              will not only shed light on the action and flexibility of RNase P, but is in
              effect a generalizable experimental strategy for investigating the function of
              any protein or catalytic RNA of interest.   This approach also extends the
              power of evolutionary analysis by providing a dynamic, experimentally based
              complement to more conventional retrospective approaches.
