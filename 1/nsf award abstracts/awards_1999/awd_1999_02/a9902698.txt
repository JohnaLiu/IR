The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Vanessa Z. Chan with support
              for twelve months to work with Professor Martin Moeller at the University of
              Ulm in Germany.
Dr. Chan will study growth and patterning of biological
              materials on functionalized surfaces.  Her goal is to understand the
              fundamental processes that govern a cell's internal response to its
              environment.  Cells will be cultured on biocompatible templates which are
              several orders of magnitude smaller than a typical cell and the responses of
              the cell's extracellular matrix determined by fluorescence microscopy and
              micromechanical measurements.  She will determine what governs adhesion
              behavior in a cell.  Understanding adhesion on this fundamental level will help
              to address questions in tumor development, metastases and wound healing.

The
              University of Ulm has all of the necessary facilities and equipment required
              for this project, as well as linkages with other European research institutions
              to ensure multiple collaborations.  Dr. Moller's research group has been
              involved in the development of new approaches to prepare nanoscopic chemical
              nanopattern by means of block copolymers, which is complementary to Dr. Chan's
              research.
