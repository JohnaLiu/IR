Title: The Impact of Snow Anomalies on Interannual Northern Hemisphere
              Climate Variability

The proposed work aims at establishing the snow cover
              and land surface forcing link to seasonal-interannual climate variability in
              the Northern Hemisphere. A conceptual model will be developed based on
              land-atmosphere interactions that will explain a significant portion of the
              climate variability associated with such modes of the atmosphere as the North
              Atlantic Oscillation. The ways in which the conceptual model could serve as the
              basis for a seasonal to an interannual forecast system will be investigated.
              The work is important because it will yield improved understanding of the role
              of snow in climate.
