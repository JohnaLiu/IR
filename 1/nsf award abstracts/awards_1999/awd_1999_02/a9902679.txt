This award supports David Butcher of Western Carolina
              University in a collaboration with Kay Niemax and Michael Bolshov of the
              Institute of Spectrochemistry and Applied Spectroscopy at the University of
              Dortmund, Germany.  The research cooperative project will couple
              high-performance liquid chromatography with diode laser atomic absorption
              spectrometry to analyze the compounds in the combustion products of
              methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT).  Controversy has developed
              recently regarding the potential toxicity of the fuel additive, which has been
              marketed in the United States for unleaded gasoline since 1995.  Health risks
              associated with MMT remain unknown because of insufficient knowledge of its
              combustion products.  The new combination of analytical techniques should be
              able to replace the complicated and expensive instrumentation requirements of
              present analytical methods.  The diode laser atomic absorption technique was
              developed at the University of Dortmund where the PI will spend two-and-a-half
              weeks to evaluate the sensitivity of the method.  Given positive results of
              that effort, collaboration will continue in order to obtain fundamental
              information regarding the combustion and toxicity of MMT.
