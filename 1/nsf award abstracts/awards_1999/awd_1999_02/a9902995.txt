This project will sysematically analyze global broadband and
              selected regional data to addressquestions about the state of the Earth's
              mantle with new methods and greater resolution.  The first project strives to
              understand the distribution of small-scale (~10 km) heterogeneity throughout
              the mantle using observation of scattered waves between P and PP.  Envelop
              stacks of many P wave trains in the global seismic network database show
              diagnostic patterns of energy as a function of range and arrival time.  Stacks
              of regional network observations will augment the analysis by providing
              higher-resolution observations for a few locales.  Modeling with single and
              multiple scattering theories will provide a profile of scatterer strength as a
              function of depth in the entire mantle.  The second task will be the analysis
              of the core-mantle boundary by reflected phases.  We have identified more than
              20,000 arrivals of PcP and ScP and will attempt to map the spatial variability
              of amplitude and frequency content of core reflections.  In addition, we have
              obtained numerous West Coast regional array recordings of core reflections,
              which can provide high-resolution results for limited areas of the CMB.
