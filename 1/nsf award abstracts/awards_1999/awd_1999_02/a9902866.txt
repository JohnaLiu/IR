In order to understand the dynamic behavior in the Earth and
              particularly the development if anisotropy, the propsed research will combine
              quantitative characterization of naturally and experimentally deforemed rocks
              (applying optical and elctron microscopy and x-ray, electron and neutron
              diffraction methods) and ploycrystal plasticity theory.  The theory.  The
              theory will be used to simulate the development of crystal preferred
              orientation and microstructures based on intra-crystalline mechanisms such as a
              slip and dynamic re-crystallization.  The goal of this research is to refine a
              model for dynamic  re-crystallization that ballances nucleation and boundary
              migration based on the deformation state of individual orientations.  It is
              proposed to first approach simple model systems such as hcp (Zn) and halite
              (with some relevance for core epsilon-iron, and lower mantle MgO) which are
              easy for experimentation to capture and quantify some of the critical
              ingredients.  Later the methodology will be applied to the more complex systems
              of peridotite and granite.
