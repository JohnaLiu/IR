Abstract    :
              The researches propose to use a multi-faceted approach to measure educational
              gains by undergraduates at the University of Delaware who participated in their
              Undergraduate Research Program.  They implemented a four-year evaluation that
              would provide a model of assessment for dissemination to other institutions. 
              This proposal requests funding of two new aspects of the research.  The first
              component consists of using an expert in the cognitive development area to
              assist with measurement techniques and perform a detailed statistical analysis
              to integrate data from a cognitive development measure into the overall
              longitudinal study.  The second part is to have a postdoctoral student perform
              extensive analysis of the combined data from the current cognitive development
              study and that from another four-year study on related curricular innovation in
              the area of Problem-Based Learning.  The researchers' goal is to determine
              which combinations of parameters and analytical questions provide the best
              encompassing model for a multi-faceted evaluation of cognitive and educational
              gains in undergraduate students.
