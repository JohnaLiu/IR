9902167

Sexual selection, the selective force that results from
              competition between males for access to mates, has received increasing
              attention in recent years.  Researchers have uncovered a startling array of
              biological traits that males have evolved to enhance their success in obtaining
              mates. This study seeks to examine how females might influence the process of
              sexual selection, and in particular, the way in which sperm from multiple males
              compete within a female's reproductive tract in the fruit fly, Drosophila
              melanogaster.  The first component of this study will examine how patterns of
              sperm competition vary among different female genotypes. The second component
              will look at the relationship between how attractive a male is and the ability
              of his sperm to compete with other males' sperm. The final component will
              determine whether males with experimentally reduced attractiveness have reduced
              sperm competitive ability, due to facultative responses in the female.

While
              the male role in sexual selection has been examined extensively, far less is
              known of the female role. Typically, females have been considered as passive
              participants whose preferences and other reproductive behaviors vary little. 
              In order to more fully understand reproductive decisions in general, we need to
              add a more complete understanding of the female perspective to what we already
              know about the mating decisions of males.
