Abstract    :
              This award will support a workshop on the use of alkenones as estimators of
              ocean temperature, CO2 (aq), and algal growth rates.  Participants from a wide
              range of bioogical, chemical and geological fields will identify limitations i
              the present understanding of alkenone biogeochemistry, develop a consensus on
              future reseach needed to oercome the limitations, and evaluate the level of
              uncertainty of alkenone-based paleo-estimates compared to uncertainties of
              other paleoenvironmental indicators.
