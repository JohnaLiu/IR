The subject of adaptation has been one of the central topics
              in evolutionary biology for most of its history. Modern approaches to the study
              of adaptation incorporating phylogenic information are still very new and are
              only beginning to be widely used. The  adaptive value of different color
              patterns in snakes as it relates to avoiding predation has received much
              attention historically in different contexts, including mimicry, concealment
              and predator confusion during flight. This study permits the application of
              modern test of adaptational hypotheses to a trail that varies during ontogeny.
              It will examine the adaptive significance of ontogenetric color pattern changes
              in selected colubrine snakes as it may relate to defense against predation. The
              correlation of color change and morphometrics studied in the context of
              phylogeny will form the basis of this investigation. The results of this study
              will permit testing of the hypothesis that color patterns and ontogenetic color
              patterns are adaptations for defense against predation. The results of this
              work will further our understanding of evolution and its effects.
