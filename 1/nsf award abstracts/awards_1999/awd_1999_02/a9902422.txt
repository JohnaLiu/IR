This project is to study seismic anisotropy, which can offer
              important clues about the crustal evolution and the dynamics of the mantle. 
              The project proposes a new way of simultaneously using three-component single
              station and array data of broad-band P wave arrivals that may be less sensitive
              to tradeoffs between anisotropy and isotropic heterogeneity or to tradeoffs
              between spatial extent versus strength of anisotropy.  This method provides a
              new tool to image the anisotropic properties of the near-receiver upper mantle
              and crust.  This study will provide both a more realistic view of the behavior
              of P-waves, characterizing the deviation of longitudinal motion from the
              source-receiver great circle and providing a different method of characterizing
              anisotropy.
