This U.S.-Czech research project between Michael
              Behrenfeld of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, and Ondrej Prasil of
              the Institute of Microbiology, Czech Academy of Sciences, features
              characterization of photoacclimation strategies employed by phytoplankton in
              response to changes in growth conditions. The researchers intend to employ
              variable and constant irradiance regimes in lab states under nutrient limiting
              conditions and within a vertically mixing water column.  They will also draw
              upon an array of remote sensing technology and extrapolate findings to build a
              data set useful in primary productivity modeling.  The U.S.-Czech team's
              complementary expertise in phytoplankton physiology and productivity modeling
              benefits from the Czech partner's parallel collaboration with colleague,
              Richard Geider of the Marine Biological Association of the U.K.
              

Specifically, results should show susceptibility of primary productivity to
              photoinhibition and the relationship between variable fluorescence parameters
              and overall rates of photosynthesis and growth. The consolidated database would
              be useful to a variety of ecologists and algal physiologists who have interest
              in ocean monitoring. If successful, this should improve parameterization of key
              biological variables in phytoplankton productivity models thereby making global
              models more reliable for interpreting satellite observed chlorophyll fields in
              world oceans. 

This international project in biological oceanography
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              experts in the Untied States and Central Europe to combine complementary
              talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence.
