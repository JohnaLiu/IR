This project involves the final fieldwork for a long term
              study of the changing relationship between the Mafia and antimafia forces in
              Palermo, Sicily, Italy.  The overall project has tracked the criminal justice
              crackdown on the Mafia, and the antimafia citizens' social movement to change
              the ways Palermo citizens relate to each other in social settings.  The
              investigators, two cultural anthropologists, will re-interview members of a set
              of 30 working class families residing in Palermo's poor neighborhoods, conduct
              follow up interviews with members of the criminal justice system, and conduct
              participant observation in local churches and trade unions.  The propositions
              to be tested are that the antimafia movement leaders, who tend to belong to the
              educated middle classes, have lost some support from working class citizens
              because of the loss of working class jobs in construction resulting from the
              judicial crackdown on the Mafia's activities, which included construction.  The
              tension between on the one hand the citizens' interest in fostering civil
              society, political transparency, non-violence, gender equality and the rule of
              law, and on the other hand the working class families' need for  paying jobs
              and the relation of these jobs to Mafia patronage, will be investigated by the
              researchers.  The general lesson of this research is that civil society
              rhetoric often may ignore connections between criminal elements and neo-liberal
              economic development policies and projects, as well as ignore the general issue
              of the need for redistributive measures on the part of states.
