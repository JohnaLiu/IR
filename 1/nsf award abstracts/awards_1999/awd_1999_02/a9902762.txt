Continental interiors commonly remain stable for long
              periods of geologic time, unaffected by tectonism even when their plate margins
              are active.  Yet, these rocks bear clear evidence of extensive but ancient
              tectonic activity.  Just how this transition from active tectonism and
              associated magmatism to a stable craton ("cratonization") was accomplished is
              controversial.  This project will study precambrain rocks in the Lake Superior
              region that may produce data to discriminate between several current concepts
              or models for this process.  The age pattern and duration of post-Penokean
              granites vary between models and age dates from a number of plutons will be an
              important component of the study.  Results are expected to document the
              transition from active tectonism to stabilization of the craton for the Lake
              Superior example, which will be of considerable importance in understanding
              this process in other cratons.
