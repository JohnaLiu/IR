	This project supports the dissertation research
              of an anthropology student from Rutgers University studying the impact of
              violence and displacement on illness in Mozambique.  Combining
              political-economic and symbolic perspectives, the student examines how conflict
              reconfigures conceptions of illness and gender relations.  The study will
              document the relation between social destabilization, traumatic violence and
              changing conceptions of illness, as well as the relationship between biomedical
              and indigenous medical discourses, focusing on post-traumatic stress, AIDS, and
              infertility.  Data will be collected using a multi-method sampling frame
              including life-histories, semi-structured interviews, participant observation,
              a household survey, and archival research, mainly on the district seat town of
              Mutarara, a site of intense conflict where 90 percent of the population of
              about 750 households sought refuge elsewhere then returned.  The town is also
              the site of the district hospital.  The study will advance our understanding of
              the effects of violence, displacement and repatriation on the social
              construction of the daily roles of men and women.  In addition the project
              supports the training of a young social scientist, and advances our knowledge
              of this important area of the world.
