Many plant species, especially trees, abort
              relatively large proportions of their fertilized flowers. Although such
              abortion can occur at any stage of fruit development, often substantial
              abortion occurs very late in the fruit maturation period. Many theories have
              been developed to explain this phenomena, but very little is known about the
              actual abortion process. In particular, it is generally not known whether the
              fruits that are aborted represent a random sample of the fertilized ovules or
              whether abortion represents the mortality of seeds with specific pedigrees,
              e.g., fruits developing after self-pollination. Platypodium elegans is a
              tropical tree with relatively high late fruit abortion.  Advanced DNA
              technologies will be used to compare aborted fruits, non-aborted fruits, and
              established seedlings of this species to document whether natural selection is
              acting to select seedlings with specific pedigrees or genetic
              compositions.

This study will greatly advance our understanding of plant
              breeding systems and will provide greater understanding of the role natural
              selection plays in the early stages of plant life cycles. The results of this
              research may also allow predictions of the effect of tropical forest
              fragmentation on the ability of trees like P. elegans to successfully
              reproduce.
