This project proposes to study the lateral heterogeneity
              and anisotropy in D; at the coremantle boundary and to account for the effects
              if D" structure in the analysis of inner core anisotropy from core-sensitive
              seismic data.  Previous results have had success in constraining D' sturcture
              by modeling differential travel times of SH-SKS and SHdiff-SKS waves along
              corridors in the Pacific using a ray theoretical approach and finite difference
              computations.  This proposal will expand this modeling effort in several
              directions, such as increasing coverage of the Pacific, peforming waveform
              modeling of the SV diff phase, and expanding an effort to model the effect of
              D" structure on PKP phases, particularly PKP (AB), which can be used to study
              inner core anisotropy.  The results of this research will provide more accurate
              constraints on the heterogeneity in D' and the anisotropy of the inner core,
              and these seismic observations will ultimately be important for understanding
              deep mantle geodynamics and core dynmics.
