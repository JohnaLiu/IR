Title:  4th
              International Airborne Remote Sensing Conference Support (June 1999)

This
              grant provides partial support of the fourth of a series of international
              conferences on applications of airborne remote sensing, to be held in Ottawa,
              Canada on June 21-24, 1999.  About 800 participants from 40 countries are
              expected.  There will be strong participation by U.S. researchers from
              universities, government laboratories, and industry.  In addition to about 300
              technical presentations, there will be an exhibition of aircraft equipped with
              remote sensing instruments at a nearby airfield.  The conference is an
              effective way to exchange new ideas and technical information on the latest
              developments and capabilities of airborne remote sensing systems.
