Abstract    :
              This project explores the mechanism of thermal reactions of relatively small
              hydrocarbon molecules in order to probe more deeply the characteristics of the
              chemical transformations which convert them into other structures.  Analogs of
              these small molecules will be labelled with stable isotopes, which will serve
              as markers in the reactants.  A more comprehensive view of the reactions
              themselves may be gained through determining the disposition of isotopic labels
              in the products formed.  Insights as to reaction mechanisms and a stimulus to
              theoretical, molecular quantum mechanics-based attempts to comprehend the
              reactions will result.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program continues support for the research of Professor John E.
              Baldwin of Syracuse University.  Professor Baldwin selects examples of
              reactions of interest involving relatively small molecules.  These molecules
              are synthesized while incorporating a nonradioactive isotope of carbon and/or
              hydrogen at specific sites, and the reaction of interest is then carried out. 
              By tracking the fate of the isotope, information into the minute goings-on of
              the reaction can be gathered, building toward a fuller understanding of the
              fundamental nature of what scientists refer to as a "chemical reaction."
