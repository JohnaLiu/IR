The Transmexican Volcanic Belt, which runs basically
              east-west across central Mexico, contains a series of north-south trending late
              Cenozoic grabens.  These faulted basins contain a rich vertebrate fossil record
              that has only recently been recognized as to its extent.  The apparent
              completeness of this record, based on preliminary research, shows great promise
              in being able to establish an unbroken evolutionary series of vertebrates from
              the early Miocene through the Pleistocene.  Climatic and environmental changes
              of major scope, times of arrivals of South American immigrants, as well as
              reasons for extinctions of many forms are topics that will be addressed in the
              present research.  Types of sediments, which include abundant volcanic ash and
              volcanic rocks bordering and underlying the basins, allow for great chronologic
              precision of the above events.
