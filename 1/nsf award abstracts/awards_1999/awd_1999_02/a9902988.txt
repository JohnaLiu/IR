This grant provides partial support for the costs of
              constructing a new (U-Th)/He thermochronology laboratory to compliment existing
              40Ar/39Ar and fission track (FT) thermochronology laboratories at Stanford
              University.  The term thermochronology refers to the use of natural radioactive
              decay "clocks" to reconstruct the time-temperature histories experienced by
              rocks.  Because temperature can commonly be used as a proxy for burial depth,
              these methods may be used to help reconstruct exhumation, mountain building,
              and deformational histories.  Different thermochronometers are sensitive within
              different temperature intervals and thus at different depths.  In the mineral
              apatite, the He and FT system are highly complementary in that their
              sensitivity intervals are about 40 to 85 degrees C (about 1.5 to 3 km depth)
              and 80-125 degrees C (about 3 to 5 km depth), respectively.

Initial work in
              the new facility will be directed toward a range of studies including: 
              investigating late Cenozoic transpression and mountain building along the San
              Andreas fault system in the San Francisco Bay Area to contribute toward
              kinematic understanding of the system and to seismic hazard assessment;
              reconstructing the history of Tertiary extension in the northern Basin and
              Range Province in Nevada and Utah; reconstructing Mesozoic and Cenozoic
              mountain building and deformational histories in central Asia; and using
              fission track external detector uranium micromapping methods and SHRIMP-RG ion
              microprobe element micromapping methods to assess the effects of U and Th
              zoning on the accuracy of (U-Th)/He ages.
