Residential development has resulted in extensive
              fragmentation of the coastal sage scrub habitat in southern California. A
              long-standing problem in avian demographic studies is that estimates of
              survivorship are often biased, because they derive solely from observations of
              disappearance of marked individuals which may occur from either mortality or
              emigration. Turnover of individuals due to behavioral factors, if subsumed in
              the adult mortality estimate, would bias it upwards. 

This study asks
              whether the Southern California Rufous-crowned Sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps
              canescens) experiences reduced reproduction and survival in habitat adjacent to
              developed edges compared to habitat interior areas. It focuses on the
              relationship between territory turnover dynamics and survivorship by resighting
              marked individuals both on and off-plot, during the breeding and non-breeding
              seasons. These data in combination with reproductive data and extensive habitat
              measures, allows tests of assumptions about breeding history, site fidelity and
              dispersal. Elucidation of these relationships enables more confident
              attribution of territory turnover to either dispersal or mortality. The
              complete data set establishes a foundation for rigorously examining
              relationships between individual fitness, local dynamics, and landscape
              effects. These data would also shed light on post-breeding and natal dispersal
              settlement patterns, as well as the extent to which the disparate climatic
              conditions of the 1998 El Nino and 1999 La Nina may have affected habitat
              quality along edges.
