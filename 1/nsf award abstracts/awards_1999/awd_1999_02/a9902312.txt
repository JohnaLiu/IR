The goal of this project is to identify how a rare,
              genetically controlled, male body color pattern variant is maintained in many
              natural populations of mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki. This persistence is
              striking because males have only a single copy of the color-determining gene
              and theory suggests that this type of variation should not readily persist in
              nature.  This study will address: (1) how water temperature may affect the
              expression of body color so as to mask the gene that causes melanism and make
              silver males appear more common than they really are; (2) how silver and
              melanic males interact with each other and with females; and (3) whether silver
              and melanic males differ in the number of offspring they sire when they compete
              for females, using behavioral observations and controlled genetic crosses.

              
The study addresses a fundamental gap between theory and empirical pattern. 
              In theory, single-copy genes, or haploids, ought not to exhibit much genetic
              variation in nature; in practice, variations like this one are common.  It also
              addresses a novel feature of natural genetic variation, that of
              temperature-dependent expression and whether that expression is actually
              masking more genetic variation than is apparent.  The way in which genetic
              variation is expressed in different thermal environments is a key issue in
              understanding how animals will respond to global change and whether that
              response will be merely ecological or also evolutionary.
