This study will employ oxygen isotope ratios (d18-O) in
              igneous
rocks as a monitor of otherwise unobservable processes in the deep
              crust
and upper mantle. Because oxygen is the dominant element in the crust
              and
mantle, and its isotopes are stable, large differences from the
              average
mantle d18-O value are only formed during low temperature processes
              near
the surface of the Earth. When such highly fractionated rocks are
              deeply
buried or subducted, their distinctive d18-O is readily recognized if
              they
become involved in the genesis or contamination of magmas. In the
              past,
such studies have been hindered by post-magmatic alteration, but
              recently
developed technology permits analysis of the refractory mineral
              zircon
which is resistant to alteration. Analysis of previously age-dated
              (U-Pb)
zircons will be made at high analytical precision by laser and in situ
              by
ion microprobe. Zircon samples will include the oldest known samples of
              the
Earth, mantle megacrysts from kimberlite, and tectonically well
              constrained
rocks from the western U.S. Major goals include: correlation of
              d18-O with
age which monitors the maturation of the crust through time, and
              mapping of
anomalous regions of surface-derived rocks buried in the upper
              mantle and
deep crust. Other aspects of this study will further develop the
              use of
oxygen isotope ratios in zircon as a powerful new tool for petrologic
              and
tectonic studies.
