This proposal is a request for funds for two people to
              travel to Yucatan, Mexico to collect water samples in the wake of Tropical
              Storm Mitch.  That storm passed directly over the area in which I have been
              studying groundwater geochemistry and hydrogeology for several years.  The
              samples collected will be analyzed for their isotopic composition of oxygen and
              hydrogen, and the results will be compared with measurements on samples
              collected in 1996 and (mostly) in 1997 (Perry et al, 1997).  The principal
              objective of this study is to compare the isotopic composition of pairs of deep
              and shallow groundwater samples.  As many sampling sites as possible will be
              localities that have been sampled previously (Table I and Fig.1) in order to
              have a basis with which to compare post-storm observations.  It is important
              that these samples be collected as soon as possible after the storm, before
              mixing can take place within the aquifer.
