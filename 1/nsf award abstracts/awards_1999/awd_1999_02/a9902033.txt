Abstract    :
              This is a proposal from American Association for the Advancement of Science
              (AAAS) to hold a workshop to capture community input and to produce a publicly
              available report summarizing visions as to the future of NSF's Advanced Network
              Infrastructure programs following the present vBNS generation. This is an
              essential part of the NSF planning process and the information gathered and
              published will be extremely helpful to NSF and the R&E community at large. The
              Advanced Network Infrastructure program has a number of important constituent
              groups that should be consulted as a part of a post-vBNS planning activity.
              These groups include at least the following sectors: university CIOs and
              administrators, the general science and university research community, the
              computer and networking science research community, industry, and those
              involved with the Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure
              (PACI). This AAAS proposal will allow us to cover the general science and
              university research community.
