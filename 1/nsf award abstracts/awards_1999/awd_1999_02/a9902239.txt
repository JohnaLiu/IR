Abstract    :
              The Winteraceae are regarded as among the oldest and most primitive families of
              flowering plants.  These ~65 species lack xylem vessels, which are thought to
              be a critical adaptation permitting angiosperms to achieve their current
              ecological domination. The Winteraceae have been viewed as 'living fossils'
              that survive in wet forest pockets where their tracheid-based wood does not
              impose hydraulic constraints. However, phylogenetic analysis implies that the
              common ancestor of extant angiosperms had vessels and that these were lost in
              Winteraceae. Preliminary studies on Winteraceae hydraulics indicate that
              vessel-less wood does not impose a hydraulic constraint. Small xylem conduits,
              such as those found in conifers and the Winteraceae, may confer a functional
              advantage for evergreen woody plants experiencing freeze-thaw cycles. This
              hypothesis will be examined using physiological data on the water balance of
              ten Winteraceae species in the sub-alpine rainforest of Tasmania and tropical
              montane forests of New Caledonia compared to co-occurring trees with and
              without vessels.
