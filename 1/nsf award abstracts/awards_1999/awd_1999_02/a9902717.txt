This project is to 1) to map further magma chambers underneath
              important volcanoes by b-value anomalies, and 2) to test the hypothesis that
              anomalously low b-value volumes, or minima in "local recurrence time", on
              faults may map the locations most likely to generate main shocks.  Previous
              work, which produced maps of b-value variations in 3-D, has shown that b values
              (as defined in an earthquake frequency-magnitude distribution) vary strongly as
              a function of space (from 0.5 to 2.5) and sometimes as a function of time. 
              This project will continue to advance this research on two fronts, mapping
              magma chambers at volcanoes and mapping asperities in fault zones in
              California, Utah, Greece, and Japan using the tools and experience obtained
              from previous studies.
