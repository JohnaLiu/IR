The Long Valley, California, caldera is the site of a
              resurgent volcanic 
dome which is experiencing significant deformation. 
              Gravity is sensitive 
to both mass and coordinates of the observations;
              repeated measurements 
will provide information on changes in those
              parameters.   These 
observations will bound the rates of subsurface mass
              change and may also 
assist in hazard assessment and warning.  Gravity at a
              small number of 
sites in Long Valley will be observed with an absolute
              gravimeter.  High 
precision relative gravimeter ties to numerous other sites
              will expand the 
spatial coverage.  Water table variation effects will be
              minimized by site 
selection on impermeable rock where possible, and by
              analysis of 
hydrological data collected by the USGS.  Models incorporating
              the gravity 
with GPS data will be generated; from these, one can infer
              details of the 
underlying deformation dynamics.  This project is a
              collaboration with 
Stanford University researchers Paul Segall and Maurizio
              Battaglia (who are 
funded under a grant from DOE).
