Abstract    :
              Gravitational wave forms from the final plunge and coalescence of black-hole and
              neutron-star binaries are primary targets for LIGO and other gravitational wave
              interferometers.  These wave forms can only be predicted by large-scale
              numerical computations.  Important theoretical and algorithmic issues remain to
              be solved before successful simulations of compact binary mergers can be
              achieved.  A code for evolving Einstein's equations in three spatial dimensions
              and with no special symmetries assumed is needed to produce binary coalescence
              simulations.  This code must be stable and accurate.  Achieving stability will
              require theoretical advances in understanding how evolution schemes interact
              with boundary conditions when the spacetime is evolving dynamically.  Evolving
              neutron stars requires incorporating matter sources into the Einstein equation
              solver and developing stable and accurate methods for evolving the
              matter.

Thomas Baumgarte and Stuart Shapiro will construct such a code to
              solve the problem of coalescing compact binaries, combining theory and
              computation in a symbiotic fashion to make the most rapid progress possible
              toward the goal of producing gravitational wave forms.
