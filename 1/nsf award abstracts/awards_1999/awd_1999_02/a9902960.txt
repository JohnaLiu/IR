The late Mesozoic to Paleogene Franciscan Complex, Great
              Valley Group/Coast Ranges ophiolite, and the Sierra Nevada batholith of
              California comprise on of the classic examples of an ancient, Andean-style
              convergent plate margin.  In central California these units define a simple
              pattern, but are disrupted in southern California.  Additionally, in southern
              California, the arc complex sits on an enigmatic schist that, based on the age
              of an apparently cross-cutting igneous body, is too old to be the metamorphosed
              equivalent of either the Franciscan or the Great Valley sequence, yet it is
              logical that the schist should correlate with one of these sets of rocks. 
              Recent dating of detrital zircons from the schist has produced ages compatible
              with correlation to the Cretaceous rocks, leading to the possibility that the
              old igneous body is an inclusion or tectonic pebble in the schist rather than
              crosscutting the schist.  This project will persue additional detrital zircon
              studies of the schist fragments of this system in order to confirm its age and
              to assign it to the correct protolith sequence.  Resolution of this
              long-standing enigma will greatly clarify and simplify the convergent history
              of this classic area.
