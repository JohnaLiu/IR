A major field of inquiry in the earth sciences is the
              understanding of mechanisms of magma migration and how magma compositions can
              change as a result of this migration.   Areas where this is of importance
              include the geochemistry of mantle melts and the understanding of how these
              melts change as they migrate to the surface of the earth. In addition,
              infiltration and reaction in mafic layered intrusions has been recognized as an
              important mechanism in changing both the mineralogy and composition of primary
              magmatic phases. In a number of cases, these features are associate with
              platinum-group element mineralization; hence, there is considerable economic
              interest in these problems as well.   This study will combine a quantitative
              model for liquid-mineral equilibria with one-dimensional transport equations to
              develop a program for modeling magmatic reaction-transport phenomenon. The
              program is expected to be a useful tool to a broad range of igneous studies. 
              This program will be general enough so users can specify a range of starting
              compositions (including inhomogeneous host rock compositions).  For example,
              the program will allow calculation of reaction and chromatographic fronts as
              silicate liquid percolates through a porous solid matrix. In addition to the
              theoretical modeling, we plan parallel field studies of textural, chemical and
              mineralogical features of the Bushveld complex, South Africa. These field
              studies will help to constrain and compare results of the numerical models.
