Abstract    :
              This SGER award to Professor John B. Fenn of Virginia Commonwealth University is
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry
              Division.  The primary research objective of the proposed work is the
              development of the spray mechanism in electrospray ionization as a means for
              sampling polar molecules entrained in a counter flowing gas stream.  The PI is
              the pre-eminent expert in the understanding of the processes and dynamics of
              such nebulization and electrospray processes, and is in a unique position to
              carry out this work.  This SGER grant would support the development of a novel
              and insightful addition to the spray technology.  The preliminary results show
              promise for development of this method at the ppb and ppt detection level.
