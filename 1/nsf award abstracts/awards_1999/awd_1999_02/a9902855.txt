High MgO lavas (komatiites and picrites) are a rare but important
              component of the mid-Cretaceous Caribbean plateau large igneous province (LIP).
              These lava types are critical to understanding mantle temperature and dynamics
              that lead to their production but are inaccessible in other oceanic LIP
              provinces. This project is an integrated field, petrological and geochemical
              study of the recently discovered Tortugal ultramafic/mafic lavas of Costa Rica.
              Major element, trace element, platinum group element and Sr-Nd-Pb-Os isotope
              analyses, combined with 40Ar-39Ar dating, will be used to characterize the
              Tortugal lavas in order to further document the spatial and temporal
              variability in petrogenesis related to LIP formation in the region. The
              Tortugal suite is temporally related to the Gorgona Island komatiites, picrites
              and basalts 1000 km to the southeast, however preliminary data show significant
              differences in mantle source and thermal regime between the two areas.
              Understanding the spatial variability in high MgO lavas will help distinguish
              between rapid decompression melting or plume head models for the creation of
              the Caribbean plateau.
