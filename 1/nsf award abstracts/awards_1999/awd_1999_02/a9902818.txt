The investigators propose to develop an improved model of
              geologically instantaneous plate motions that will change estimated velocities
              in some regions more than the published confidence limits.  The new model will
              lead to a significantly different set of angular velocities that will have a
              higher degree of self-consistency than do the NUVEL-1A angular velocities and
              will eliminate several sources of systematic error that are now understood. 
              The team will use the new and existing data to test the rigid plate hypothesis
              and to estimate upper and lower bounds on plate non-rigidity.  The new set of
              angular velocities will provide a new standard for comparison with ongoing GPS
              and other geodetic observations at a tiny fraction of the cost of such
              observations.
