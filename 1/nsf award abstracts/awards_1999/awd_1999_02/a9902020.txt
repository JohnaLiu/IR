Abstract    :
              
The identification of biomolecules within complex multi-molecular
              bioassemblies is a necessary step toward understanding the structure and
              function of a living cell.  Energy filtering transmission electron microscopy
              (EFTEM) represents an efficient method for this identification.  Bioengineering
              of immunolabels containing incorporated atoms of exogenous elements will allow
              us to reveal the distribution of these labels based on the elements mapping. 
              The objective of this project is  the bioengineering of immunolabels suitable
              for marking molecules in the complex multimolecular bioassemblies and for
              detecting them with EFTEM.

Four new types of molecules will be engineered: 
              1) constructs of chimeric protein G containing the metal binding sequences of
              the ferritin heavy chain; 2) chimeric avidin containing metal binding sequences
              of metallothionein; 3) chimeric scFv with poly-histidine tags; and 4) new
              metallo-organic clusters with functional groups.  These constructs will be used
              to demonstrate the feasibility of mapping of specific molecular entities within
              intact cells using EFTEM.
