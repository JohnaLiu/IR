All organisms experience variation in
              environmental conditions as weather and seasons change.  This variation can
              induce variability in the size of a population that consequently increases the
              population's risk of extinction.  The proposed research will experimentally
              test the hypothesis that heterogeneity of thermal microclimates within a
              habitat can reduce weather-induced variation in population dynamics. The
              research will analyze effects of habitat heterogeneity.  Populations of
              Drosophila melanogaster that inhabit rotting apples in orchards will be used as
              a study system because both the animals and their habitat can be manipulated,
              and effects on individuals and populations can be quantified.  The research
              will: (1) characterize environmental and within-habitat variation in
              temperature conditions that occur in apples;  (2) quantify the effect of these
              temperature conditions on fitness of individual flies; and (3) experimentally
              manipulate the thermal heterogeneity of the orchard habitat to measure how it
              affects population dynamics of D. melanogaster.  This research will contribute
              to a better understanding of how habitat heterogeneity and environmental
              variation affect animal populations.  The results are especially important for
              conservation biology because they may improve predictions about how habitat
              modification will affect the persistence of rare or endangered
              species.
