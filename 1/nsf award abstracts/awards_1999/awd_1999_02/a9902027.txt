Abstract    :
              Computational geometry concerns the design and analysis of algorithms for
              problems involving large amounts of geometric data.  This project seeks simpler
              and more efficient algorithms for fundamental problems in computational
              geometry that have applications in computer graphics, computer vision,
              databases, and statistics.  The problems to be studied include geometric
              optimization, construction of basic geometric structures, and the design of
              data structures for processing geometric queries. The problems will be
              approached using randomization, approximation, and techniques for correcting
              pessimistic worst-case analyses.
