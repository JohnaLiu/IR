The thesis of this project is that common magmatic structures in
              granitic
plutons of the Sierra Nevada Batholith, California, may have formed
              by
sequential deposition from an active magma chamber onto a chamber
              floor.
Research will focus on two plutons (the Crystal Range suite and the
              Jackass
Lakes pluton) where depositional packages provide opportunities to
              examine
temporal sequences of processes that are fundamental to understanding
              the
formation and evolution of plutons (and magma chambers) -
              magma
emplacement, crystallization, replenishment, hybridization, deposition,
              and
fractionation.   The goal of this research is to establish sequences
              of
events from stratigraphic sections in portions of both intrusions,
              using
detailed studies of outcrop-scale field relations, petrography,
              mineral
chemistry, and whole-rock geochemical variation.  These relations can
              be
used to characterize and quantify processes of hybridization due
              to
interactions between felsic and mafic magmas, and to quantify the
              cumulate
character of the interlayered mafic, hybrid and granitoid rocks. 
              This
research has important implications for the emplacement of granitic
              plutons.
