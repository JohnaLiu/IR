The PI proposes to continue computational studies of
              convection and magnetic field generation in the Earth's core using the
              Glatzmaier-Roberts model, which produced the first dynamically self-consistent
              computer simulation of the geodynamo.  In particular, he proposes to
              investigate the potentially first-order effects of graviational coupling
              between the mantle and solid inner core and the effects of the mantle's
              precession on the dynamics of the fluid core.  The PI also hopes to gain
              greater confidence in the geodynamo simulations by simulating, with a modified
              version of the Glatzmaier-Roberts model, a proposed laboratory experiment is
              being conducted by D. Lathrop at University of Maryland and is separately
              funded.
