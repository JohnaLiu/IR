The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Jennifer L.
              Sokoloski with twelve months of support to work with Dr. Phil A. Charles at
              Oxford University in the UK, and for twelve months at Harvard University in
              Cambridge, MA, working with Dr. Scott Kenyon.  Partial support for this project
              is provided by NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities and their Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics
              Program.
This project involves the study of the accretion of matter in binary
              systems, which are symbiotic systems of white dwarfs and red giants. 
              Specifically, this involves observation using x-ray, ultraviolet and ground
              based observations.  These binary systems are important because they might be
              progenitors of supernovae, which in turn are used to tabulate distances at
              cosmological scales.  The principal investigator will have access to telescope
              time in the Anglo-Australian telescope and the telescope in the Canary Islands,
              with additional telescope time from collaborators in Poland.  She will also be
              measuring the orbital size of the binary system, which has not ever been
              accomplished for symbiotics.
Dr. Charles is the head of the astrophysics
              sub-department at Oxford, which is known for both expertise in the field of
              interacting binaries and breadth of research interests.  Dr. Scott Kenyon is an
              expert on symbiotic binaries.
