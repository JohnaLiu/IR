Understanding factors which influence forest regeneration in
              abandoned agricultural lands is a longstanding goal of terrestrial plant
              ecologists and a key challenge for tropical forest conservation. The
              mycorrhizal fungi community is an often-overlooked factor which may influence
              forest regeneration rates and plant species composition in regenerating
              landscapes. This dissertation research will use a combination of field studies,
              greenhouse experiments and molecular analyses to examine differences in
              mycorrhizal fungi community composition between tropical forest fragments and
              pastures, and whether these differences have consequences for seedling
              establishment in pastures by a tropical forest tree. Principal objectives of
              the research are to determine (1) whether species composition of mycorrhizal
              fungi differs between forest fragments and adjacent pastures, (2) whether
              species composition of mycorrhizae differs between forest- and pasture-grown
              seedlings of a tropical forest tree, and (3) whether mycorrhizal fungi of
              forest and pasture differ in their growth benefit to seedling hosts. Results of
              the proposed research have implications for pasture recolonization by forest
              tree species, forest regeneration and maintenance of plant and fungal diversity
              in human-impacted tropical ecosystems.
