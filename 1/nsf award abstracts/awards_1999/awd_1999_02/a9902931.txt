The goal of this research is to (1) test the hypothesis
that
              a variety of magma suites associated with plumes and rifting might
              be
descended from a common parental (although not primitive) magma;
              (2)
determine variations in magmatic fractionation trends that are
              controlled
by different pressures and oxidation states; (3) assess possible
              relations
between melts associated with anorthosites; and (4) test whether
              the
solubility of carbon at moderate pressures can cause strong
              iron-enrichment
in some magmas.  The experimental technique used is
              fractional
crystallization experiments performed in piston-cylinder
              pressure
apparatus, with a variety of pressures, sample containers, and
              imposed
oxygen fugacities.  Experimental products are examined using
              the
petrographic microscope, x-ray diffraction, and the electron
              probe
microanalyser.  When reactions between minerals and melt occur, or when
              the
proportion of crystals exceeds 50%, a new bulk composition will
              be
synthesized, corresponding to the composition of the melt in the
              previous
experiment.  This procedure permits evaluation of
              fractional
crystallization as temperature is lowered, yet maintains a
              relatively high
proportion of melt in each experiment, which is useful for
              microprobe
analysis and attainment of equilibrium.
