Arc magmatism is generally thought to be associated with
              extensional deformation within the arc environment, but in some instances it
              can be associated with contractional deformation.  In the Klamath Mountains
              province of California, extension related arc magmatism alternated with
              contraction-related magmatism, but the former resulted in calc-alkaline magmas
              whereas the latter was associated with distinctive K20-rich magmas.  The Bear
              Mountain intrusive complex contains these pluton types and their contact
              aureoles.  This study will address the kinematic and strain history, the
              petrography and thermobarometry of the plutons and wall rocks in order to
              relate magma composition to tectonic environment.  Petrologic modeling will
              attempt to understand the formation and evolution of the pluton and contact
              zone, including migmatitic rocks.  Results will provide clearer understanding
              of the links between magma composition, tectonic setting and development of
              strain fabrics, both for the Bear Mountain complex and other examples for arc
              magmatism in convergent and extensional circumstances.
