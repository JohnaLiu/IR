Abstract    :
              This project is directed toward the study of humic acid halogenation and related
              reactions.  Specifically, a new synthesis of cyclopentadienones was discovered
              and a new route to hydroxyfulvenes was developed.  Further investigation of
              this chemistry is planned, as are additional studies of the halogenation
              reactions of phenols and humic acid models.  The latter studies have
              implications in gaining a better understanding of drinking water
              contamination.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program continues support for the research of Professor Victor L. Heasley of
              Point Loma Nazarene College.  Professor Heasley is investigating the chemistry
              of certain ground water components with chlorinating agents so to better
              understand the nature of drinking water contamination.  Another aspect of
              Heasley's work is in offering undergraduate students of chemistry an exposure
              to research on an important and timely topic.
