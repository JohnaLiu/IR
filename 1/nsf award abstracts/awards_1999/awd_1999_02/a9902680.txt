Limestone sequences over 250 meters thick in the
              Lower Cretaceous of Spain, England and France are made up of hundreds of
              meter-scale sedimentary cycles produced by apparent rises and falls of
              sea-level.  The purpose of this project is to map the distribution and
              hierarchic arrangement of these cycles at key localities in each country to
              demonstrate that the cyclic patterns can be matched.  Correlation of these
              cycles would be strong evidence that a global process acted in the Early
              Cretaceous to control the accumulation of sedimentary rocks.  The global
              process, the 'Milankovitch Orbital Forcing Hypothesis', is a periodic mechanism
              that may control sea-level by forcing change in global glacial ice volume or
              causing changes in climate.  This project is expected to be a significant test
              of this fundamental hypothesis.
