Basaltic lava flows, although emplaced under a wide range of
              conditions, can be classified as one of three types - pahoehoe, `a`a, or blocky
              - on the basis of both flow surface morphology and on the mechanism by which
              the flows advance. Qualitatively, the formation of distinct flow types can be
              explained by differences in strengths of lava crusts and in the rheologies of
              flow interiors. However, limiting conditions for transitions between flow types
              must be quantitatively understood for accurate modeling of the mechanics of
              flow, and for predicting the rates and ultimate extent of lava flow advance
              during effusive eruptions.  We suggest that key to this understanding is
              quantification of feedback between parameters controlling the stability of lava
              crusts and the consequent cooling (and crystallization) of lava flow interiors.
               Toward this end, we will perform (a) field-based studies of lava flows in
              Hawai`i (Mauna Loa and Kilauea) and Italy (Mt. Etna) to document rates of lava
              cooling and crystallization, (b) laboratory and theoretical studies to
              determine the effect of crystals on lava rheology, and (c) analog experiments
              of non-laminar systems to determine limiting flow conditions for preservation
              of stable crusts. We anticipate that the results will have broad applications
              to modeling and predictions of lava flow behavior, in addition to contributing
              to research on suspension rheology and to general studies of surface
              solidification of stirred (disrupted) flows.
