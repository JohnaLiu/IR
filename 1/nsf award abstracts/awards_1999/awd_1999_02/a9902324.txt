DDIG: Ecosystem metabolism and nitrate
              retention in headwater streams: Influence of the hyporheic zone

Human
              alteration of the global nitrogen cycle through inputs of nitrogen such as
              those in fertilizer, wastewater, and combustion engine emissions is a critical
              global environmental problem.  A clear manifestation of these inputs is
              increased concentrations of nitrate, a potential pollutant, in surface and
              groundwater throughout the U.S.  Understanding nutrient dynamics in headwater
              streams is an essential part of understanding how rivers will respond to
              increased anthropogenic inputs of nitrate. The hyporheic zone (the region of
              mixing between surface water and groundwater) has recently been recognized as
              an important component of stream ecosystems, especially in headwater streams. 
              Through their metabolic activities, microorganisms which live in the hyporheic
              zone can temporarily or permanently retain nitrate and prevent it from
              traveling downstream.  This research quantifies the contribution of the
              hyporheic zone to nitrate retention in 3 headwater streams and investigates the
              relationship between this retention and rates of ecosystem metabolism.
