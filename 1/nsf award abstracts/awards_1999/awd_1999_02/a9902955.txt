The Great Unconformity of the southwestern United States
              represents a complex differential unroofing of middle crustal rocks over a
              large area, prior to its inundation by late precambrian and younger marine
              sediments.  The causes of this extensive episode of regional denudation is
              problematic, however a key to understanding it is to decipher variations in the
              location, timing and style of differential uplift in tectonic blocks across the
              region.  Ar-Ar thermochronology on K-feldspar plus structural studies should
              provide data necessary to test several hypotheses and scenarios that may
              explain the phenomena.  Successful outcomes will improve regional precambrian
              to paleozoic geology and provide insight into plateau uplift processes and
              intracratonic deformation generally.
