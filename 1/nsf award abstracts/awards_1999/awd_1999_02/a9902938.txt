In actively subducting plate boundaries, triple junctions
              migrate as a function of convergence obliquity, which is seldom orthogonal. 
              Recent geodynamic models predict a complex crustal response to triple junction
              passage including initial thickening followed by thinning within a 5 m.y. time
              frame following passage.  These geodynamic model results have specific
              geomorphological predictions, and geomorphological data from a region recently
              experiencing passage of a triple junction should provide a test of the
              geodynamic model.  This project will gather geomorphological data along the
              northern California coast where the Mendocino triple junction has been
              migrating northward along the coast.  Results will likely provide a test of the
              geodynamic model which should have broad applicability and also increase
              knowledge about the Mendocino triple junction area of northern California.
