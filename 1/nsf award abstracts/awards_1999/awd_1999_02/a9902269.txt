The ecology of invasive exotic species is a very important
              topic and concern among both applied and theoretical ecologists. However, very
              few studies have examine this problem using a solid experimental design. This
              study will examine the impacts of the invasive European honeybee (Apies
              mellifera) on native pollinator and plant communities in coastal California.
              This work will investigate and quantitatively link the impacts of European bee
              on foraging behavior and colony reproductive success for an important group of
              native pollinators, the bumblebees (Bombus spp). This is proposed to be done by
              combinations of large-scale manipulations of bee densities, measurement of
              resource availability and depletion, monitoring of bumblebee colony performance
              and quantitative modeling of competitive effects. In addition to providing
              information on the impact of invasive species on native communities, this work
              will provide insight into how and why invasive species cause community-level
              effects and it will contribute to a greater understanding of competitive
              interactions among behaviorally flexible colonial organisms.
