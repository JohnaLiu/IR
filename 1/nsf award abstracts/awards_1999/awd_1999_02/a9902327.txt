Abstract    :
              9902327

The enzyme phosphoglucomutase (PGM) plays a role in glycogen
              metabolism at a key point in the central metabolic pathway in Drosophila
              melanogaster. Significant protein variation has already been found at the PGM
              locus, but to what extent this variation plays a role in natural populations is
              unknown. The goal of this project is to combine a study of DNA sequence
              variation at the PGM locus in Drosophila melanogaster with a study of the
              functional differences of PGM variation and their effect on flux in the
              metabolic pathway. This study will screen for known protein variation in
              natural populations to test for geographic differentiation. Differences in PGM
              enzymatic activity and stability and their effect on glycogen content will also
              be determined.

Because certain points may have more influence on controlling
              metabolic flux in the pathway, it is believed that protein variation at these
              points represents potential variation upon which selection can operate to
              regulate flux in the pathway. If enzyme activity or stability variation for PGM
              does result in measurable differences in glycogen levels, this suggests that
              protein variation at the PGM locus represents variation that is influential in
              controlling flux in the pathway.  If protein variation differs significantly
              across populations, this suggests that patterns of variation at this locus in
              natural populations are influenced by natural selection.
