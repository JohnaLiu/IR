THEORY, ALGORITHMS, AND APPLICATIONS OF SIGNAL PROCESSING
              WITH THE SPARSENESS CONSTRAINT     

This research project will examine the
              theoretical and computational issues that arise in signal processing problems
              with the sparseness constraint in several important application domains. The
              research plan includes using majorization theory to develop and identify
              suitable diversity measures whose minimization leads to sparse solutions. Then,
              to minimize these measures, a new class of optimization algorithms will be
              developed, analyzed, and applied. Algorithms based on a factored representation
              for the gradient along with Affine Scaling Transformation (AST) based methods
              of interior point optimization theory will be the starting point of this work.
              To facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the methods, and to develop
              methods robust to noise, a Bayesian framework will be employed. The important
              extension to the multiple measurement vector problem will be studied greatly
              expanding the range of applications. Learning algorithms will be developed to
              tune the required overcomplete dictionaries for specific application
              environments, thereby increasing their overall effectiveness. Theoretical and
              algorithmic development will be guided by the requirements of the applications.
              Particular attention will be given to the applications of signal representation
              and neuromagnetic imaging using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) (a potentially
              important new modality for the imaging of the brain).
