The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Sam T. Roweis with support for
              twelve months to work with Dr. Geoffrey E. Hinton at the University College of
              London's Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (GCNU).
This project in the
              field of machine learning and neural networks will focus on machine learning
              for pattern recognition and signal processing.  The goal is to allow computers
              to interact intelligently with their human users by teaching them to analyze
              sensory inputs, synthesize sensory outputs, and to make decisions about what to
              do based on these inputs and outputs.  This will have applications to computer
              speech recognition and synthesis, handwriting transcription and analysis, face
              identification, automatic control of robotic manipulators or vehicles, and
              failure detection for complex machines and industrial plants.  Dr. Roweis will
              design new learning algorithms and will apply them to data from real world
              problems.  Specifically, he will work on speech compression and speaker
              identification.  He will build compression systems, which use statistical
              models that are automatically constructed by training on large databases of
              speech.  
GCNU is a new center, which has brought together researchers in the
              fields of machine learning and computational neuroscience.  Dr. Hinton,
              Director of GCNU, is a leading figure in neural networks research, and is one
              of the researchers who introduced the back-propagation algorithm and the
              Boltzmann and Helmholtz machines.  CGNU has affiliations with many nearby
              research organizations in England and Europe in this field.
