Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to establish a new technology for attaining surface
              conductivity in polymers and polymer composites, without sacrificing mechanical
              integrity.  The use of conductive polymers in industrial applications ranges
              from molding compounds of green tires to exterior body parts of automobiles to
              plastic housing of computers, notebooks, and cellular phones.  The surface and
              bulk conductivity of conductive polymers help dissipate static electricity,
              facilitate spray painting, and expedite the rate of heat conduction. In current
              technology, the whole body of tires or exterior auto body parts is molded from
              conductive polymer compounds.  Only a small fraction of the 15 - 60% by weight
              of conductive particles remains near the surface.  Fabricating separate
              conductive surface layers in multi-layer articles requires advancing the
              fundamental knowledge of the molding technology and the material compositions.
              

This investigation will study the effective surface conductivity of molded
              polymer sheets and films as a function of the kinematics of molding conditions,
              composition, and particle-particle network formation. Experimental molding of
              simple shaped, two-layer composite laminates will be conducted to demonstrate
              the concepts and to evaluate the effective conductivity.  The research plan
              includes the development of viscosity-composition-conductivity diagrams to
              guide the selection of the composition of conductive compounds.  Improved
              understanding of the parameters governing the shape of the interface and the
              strength of interlayer bonding is expected, as well as selection criteria for
              materials to improve cost and productibility.
