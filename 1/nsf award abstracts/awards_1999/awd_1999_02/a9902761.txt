The fabrics of cumulus rocks preserve the only direct evidence
              of the mechanical processes involved in fractional crystallization of silicate
              liquids. Quantification of these igneous fabrics and understanding their origin
              is critical since the mechanical processes that give rise to the fabrics have
              chemical as well as textural consequences. Because quantitative petrographic
              studies of fabrics are time consuming, we propose to use cumulates from the
              Stillwater complex, Montana to develop an approach for relating magnetic
              fabrics (that are sensitive to both the orientation of magnetic minerals as
              well as the silicate minerals) to silicate fabrics in ultramafic and mafic
              cumulates. These magnetic methods have the advantage of providing direct 3D
              fabric information, having precision to detect small degrees (~0.5%)
              anisotropy, and being rapid enough to collect fabric data from a large number
              of samples. Our initial results suggest that these magnetic techniques provide
              accurate information on magmatic foliations and, in some cases, recover
              lineations that are not evident from petrographic analysis alone. If igneous
              fabrics can be analyzed and quantified in the systematic manner  that
              geochemical data are collected, then studies of cumulates will progress past
              the point of speculating as to the importance of mechanical processes to
              documenting their importance
