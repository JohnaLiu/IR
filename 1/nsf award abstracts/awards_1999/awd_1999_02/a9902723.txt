This grant provides partial support for the costs of
              acquiring equipment to upgrade the paleomagnetics laboratory in the Department
              of Geology at the University of Florida (UF).  Specific equipment will include
              an alternating field (AF) demagnetizer and a thermal demagnetizer.  The UF
              paleomag lab is well equipped with both a u-channel superconducting rock
              magnetometer (SRM) and an SRM dedicated to the analysis of discrete samples. 
              In the U.S., only two other laboratories currently operate u-channel
              instruments, the University of California Davis (Verosub) and the University of
              Hawaii (Herrerro-Bervera).  PI's Channell and Opdyke utilize their rapid
              throughput u-channel SRM for analysis of long, high resolution paleomagnetic
              records in studies of magnetostratigraphy and secular variation of the
              geomagnetic field.  A new AF demagnetizer will replace a no longer supported
              Schonstedt AF demagnetizer and a 60 sample capacity thermal demagnetizer will
              be used for paleointensity analyses via the Thellier-Thellier method in large
              collaborative project to characterize secular variation of the geomagnetic
              field from the Pliocene to present.  This project entails a large field
              sampling program along a north-south transect from the Arctic to Antarctica
              along the Americas.
