Abstract    :
              The investigators will examine nonlinear and kinetic features of large amplitude
              Alfvenic fluctuations that are continuously observed in the solar wind. Recent
              observations from the SOHO spacecraft indicate that Alfvenic fluctuations may
              also be important in solar wind acceleration both through wave dissipation
              heating near the cyclotron resonance and direct forcing by the wave pressure
              gradient force. The main effort is to explore the connection between fluid
              (magnetohydrodynamic) and kinetic processes through hybrid simulations that
              allow full treatment of ion kinetics and wave turbulence. Two dimensional
              spectra and wave-particle interactions are included in the simulations.
