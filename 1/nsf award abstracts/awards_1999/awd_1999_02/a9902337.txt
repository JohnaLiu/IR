In most mammals, the sex of an undifferentiated embryo
              hinges on the presence or absence of the Y chromosome: males are XY and females
              are XX.  If however the Y chromosome fails to trigger maleness, XY females can
              result.  XY females exist in both humans and house mice, but at extremely low
              frequencies because human XY females are infertile and house mice are
              subfertile.  However, in eight species of field mice (genus Akodon) XY females
              exist at high frequencies (10-40% of females are XY) and are fully fertile. 
              Preliminary genealogies of species suggest that these Akodon XY females have
              originated at least six times independently.  

Once XY females originate,
              they also have to survive.  Computer models and analysis of DNA sequence
              polymorphisms will help illuminate which evolutionary mechanisms act to
              maintain XY females.  Two unusual features of Akodon reproductive biology
              appear to be important.  First, XY mothers produce more XY daughters than XX
              daughters.  Secondly, XY females tend to be more fertile than their XX
              counterparts--XY mothers produce more offspring over their lifetime.

This
              unusual system of sex chromosomes offers a unique opportunity to understand how
              new sex-determining systems evolve.  Additionally, understanding the
              evolutionary forces that act to maintain XY females illuminates how novel
              genotypes are maintained, and thus how genetic diversity exists.  Finally,
              comparisons between Akodon and human sex chromosomes may aid in understanding
              why Akodon XY females are fertile but humans are infertile.
