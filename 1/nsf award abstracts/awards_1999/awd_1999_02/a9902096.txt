Virtually all vehicle power systems have
              become dependent upon electronic controls and sensors.  As the temperature of
              the power systems is raised to get more efficient and economical operation, the
              electric systems must be capable of reliably functioning at the higher
              temperature.  Research is necessary so that economical electronic systems will
              be available as vehicle operating temperatures are increased.  This planning
              grant is funding an industry/university meeting at Auburn University to
              determine the feasibility and viability for forming an Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Vehicle Electronics.
