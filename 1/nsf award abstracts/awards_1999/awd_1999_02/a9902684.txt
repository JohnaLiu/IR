The purpose of this research proposal is to determine by
              experiment the compositions of melts produced by extremely small degrees of
              melting of the Earth's upper mantle.  The properties, compositions and the
              ultimate fate of such melts are important keys for our understanding of melt
              generation, melt transport and the creation of mantle heterogeneity as observed
              in mantle samples brought to the earth's surface by oceanic basalts on the
              ocean floor and oceanic islands.  Our failure to understand how the detailed
              geochemical properties of such basalts arise may largely be the result of the
              ubiquity and unusual chemical compositions of melts produced at the initiation
              of melting in the mantle.  These experiments will constrain the complex melt
              processes that operate to produce the vast variety of basalts on Earth, and
              indeed, even on other planets.
