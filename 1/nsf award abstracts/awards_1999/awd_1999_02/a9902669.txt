Abstract    :
              The Pythagorean-hadograph (PH) curves are an exceptionally versatile class of
              free-form parametric curves, that offer unique computational advantages over
              "ordinary" Bezier/B-spline curves in geometry-based applications such as
              computer graphics, computer-aided design, CNC machining, rapid prototyping,
              motion design, and shape analysis and reconstruction.  The PH curves were
              originally introduced to provide exact solutions to two basic problems of
              analytic geometry: the computation of arc lengths and offsets for free-form
              curves.  It has recently become apparent, however, that they offer rigorous
              algorithms for a much broader range of problems, including exact boundary
              reconstruction of shapes from medial axis transforms, exact and versatile
              real-time interpolation algorithms for CNC machining and robot trajectory
              generation, construction and analysis of "fair" shapes based on precise
              (non-linear) energy minimization, construction of rotation-minimizing frames
              for computer animation, etc.  These algorithms employ a sophisticated array of
              mathematical concepts, including complex variable representations for planar PH
              curves, Minkowski-metric PH curves for medial axis transforms, contour
              integration for Fourier curvature analysis, homotopy methods for PH spline
              constructions, etc.  This project will investigate outstanding theoretical and
              algorithmic problems in the construction, analysis, and applications of planar
              and spatial PH curves, whose solution will permit their potential to be fully
              realized in practical use.  The research will be conducted in cooperation with
              industrial collaborators, to facilitate a rapid transfer of the technology
              based on the compatibility of PH curves with the standard Bezier/B-splime
              representations of CAD systems.
