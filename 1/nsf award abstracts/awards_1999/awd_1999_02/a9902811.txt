This grant provides matching support for acquisition of basic
              paleomagnetic laboratory equipment to be housed in the Department of 
              Geological Sciences at Rutgers University.  Specific equipment to be acquired
              includes a spinner magnetometer, an alternating field (AF) demagnetizer, and a
              thermal demagnetizer.  Dennis Kent recently accepted a tenured faculty
              appointment at Rutgers University after a long and distinguished career at
              Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.  He continues to hold an appointment at LDEO
              and maintains the paleomag lab there that he was instrumental in building.  The
              LDEO lab houses a shielded room, a 2-G superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM)
              and some 1970's vintage paleomag equipment including an AF demagnetizer, 
              thermal  demagnetizers,  and a spinner maagnetometer.  This equipment will be
              housed in new space at Rutgers University where Kent will be actively involved
              in teaching undergraduate and graduate students.  The new equipment will
              replace outdated and no longer supported equipment and will offer superior
              capabilities for paleomagnetic investigations of the behavior of the Earth's
              magnetic field and for magnetostratigraphic research.
