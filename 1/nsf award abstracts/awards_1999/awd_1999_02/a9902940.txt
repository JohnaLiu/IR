Abstract    :
              This research program addresses the use of a newly developed Vision Cone
              Penetrometer (VisCPT) for earthquake-induced liquefaction hazard assessment. 
              The VisCPT is essentially a standard electronic cone penetrometer, modified by
              inclusion of two miniature CCD video cameras.  The cameras collect a continuous
              stream of video images of the soil stratigraphy by two levels of magnification.
               The VisCPT can delineate soil stratigraphy, and through various computer
              vision techniques, provide a grain size analysis of the soil.

The objective
              of this project is to collect VisCPT date at the National Geotechnical
              Experimentation Site (NGES) on Treasure Island in San Francisco, at locations
              with variable percentages of fine particles.  Physical soil samples are also
              taken.  The collected VisCPT data is evaluated with specific focus on
              image-texture techniques for determining grain size distributions.  The VisCPT
              images are also compared to standard CPT tip resistance measurements in order
              to illustrate and quantify the effects of stratigraphic layering and interfaces
              on CPT readings.
