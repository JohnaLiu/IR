TITLE :  SCALAR : Scalable Architecture for
              Replication on the Web
PI: Peter Scheuermann
Project Summary:

The wide use
              of the World-Wide Web and the ease of access to the Internet
are changing
              
drastically our requirements in distributed systems. The
              exponentially
growing scale of use of the 
Web is stressing the capacity of
              the Internet and leads to poor performance
and low reliability of 
Web
              service. Replication is one of the major techniques that have been
proposed to
              overcome these problems.

This project will focus on the development of a
              prototype system that will
provide a scalable 
architecture for replication
              on the Web.  A new client/server architecture
that will allow for
              user-transparent geographic replication is
investigated. In this system, the
              clients are downloaded as 
signed applets to commercially available browsers.
              Web servers that support
servlets can be
directly extended with servlets,
              otherwise with server-side proxies that
support servlets. Unlike 
other
              proposed Web architectures, both clients and servers take active
roles in this
              architecture.
Server machines determine the documents to be
              replicated/migrated and best
locations for the 
documents, while client
              machines choose the best server to submit their
requests based on estimates of
              the servers' prior response times. Heuristic
algorithms based on clustering
              techniques
will be developed in order to determine sets of documents that
              be
beneficially migrated/replicated as a unit.
