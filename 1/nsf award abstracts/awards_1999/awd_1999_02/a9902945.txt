Abstract    :
              Catchment structure, both surface topography and subsurface permeability, is an
              important determinant of catchment response to precipitation events.  Stream
              water chemistry is in turn influenced by time-varying flow paths that
              characterize hydrological response.  Although much progress has been made in
              recent years in understanding the flow paths and how chemical composition of
              waters reflect these paths, the impact of different simplifying assumptions
              underlying current models have not been explored systematically.  In
              particular, the dynamics of a subsurface stormflow zone above a regional water
              table have not been addressed fully even though water in the vadose zone plays
              a major role in determining stream water chemistry.  An explicit accounting of
              soil moisture must be part of an adequate quantification of catchment
              hydrochemical response.  The goal of the study is to develop a quantitative and
              predictive physically-based model of the hydrological response of a
              saprolite-granite catchment and to explore the importance of surface topography
              and subsurface structure in determining catchment hydrochemical response.
