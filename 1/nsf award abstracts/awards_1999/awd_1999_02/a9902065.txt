This dissertation research will test a new conceptual model
              explaining how river bend migration of high-energy rivers influences primary
              succession of riparian forests with high species richness. Whereas the
              traditional model of riparian forest succession describes a single pathway of
              succession, the proposed model predicts multiple pathways of succession
              promoted by predictable geomorphic processes related to the shape of the river
              channel. Specific objectives of this research include (1) a field experiment to
              test the relative importance of elevation, soil texture, light, inundation,
              and/or physical flood damage in determining where tree species become
              established on new land forms, (2) a field experiment to determine the
              importance of depth to water table on emergence and survival of several common
              floodplain tree species, and (3) determining the generality of the proposed
              model of succession among rivers in the southeastern Coastal Plain.
              Confirmation of the proposed conceptual model of primary succession will refine
              our understanding of heterogeneity of forest structure by revealing important
              links between predictable geomorphic processes and pathways of primary
              succession. This understanding will contribute to the wise management of
              southeastern rivers with the purpose of maintaining natural habitat diversity.
              The proposed research is unique in its experimental investigation of
              small-scale physical processes that influence landscape-scale patterns of
              riparian vegetation and will serve as a model for future studies in landscape
              ecology.
