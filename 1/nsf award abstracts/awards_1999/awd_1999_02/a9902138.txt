This is a three-year U.S.-China cooperative research project
              proposed by Dr. Russell Jones, University of California at Berkeley, and Dr.
              Yingtang Lu, Wuhan University, China.  This cooperative project will study
              molecular characterization of the role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
              kinases in plant.  
Dr. Jones requests funds for graduate student support,
              travel, supplies, and substance cost in the U.S. for the Chinese co-P.I. for
              carrying out this joint research.  Both U.S. and Chinese scientists are well
              qualified to carry out this study.  This is an important topic in plant science
              and this project can enhance our understanding of the calcium/calmodulin action
              in plants.  This study is jointly sponsored by the Chinese Natural Science
              Foundation; and the National Science Foundation.
