Abstract    :
              
North American hummingbirds are specialized to feed on the energy-rich diet
              
provided by flower nectar. These diminutive birds gain access to flowers
              
through their unique form of locomotion: hovering flight. Hummingbirds are
              
typically found in all North American habitats with abundant
              flowers,
including very high altitude meadows such as those that occur in the
              Colorado Rocky 
Mountains. The rufous and broad-tailed hummingbirds compete
              for floral 
resources in the Rockies across a altitudinal range spanning 2500
              meters. 
The two species weigh about the same but the wings of the rufous
              
hummingbird are on average only 83% of the size of the broad-tailed
              
hummingbird's wings. Because air is thinner in the mountains, species with
              
large wings can more easily generate enough lift to fly at high altitudes.
              
However, species with larger wings are at a disadvantage at low altitudes
              
because they are less agile than species with small wings. Small-winged
              
species outcompete large-winged hummingbirds at low altitudes, so there is
              
a trade-off between competitive ability and altitudinal range. The PIs
              predict 
that rufous hummingbirds will outcompete broad-tailed hummingbirds at
              low 
elevations and thus dominate the best resources. Conversely, the rufous
              
will be less competitive at high elevations due to high costs of flight and
              
thus relegated to the less preferred resources. The PIs also predict that the
              
increased costs of flight and related competitive behavior will be
              
influenced by the density of the air rather than by oxygen availability.
