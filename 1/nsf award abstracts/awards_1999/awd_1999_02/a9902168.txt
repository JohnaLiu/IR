Understanding the factors that affect species interactions
              are of central importance to many ecological processes. This study will examine
              how differences is host plant quality arising from a range of resource
              environments contribute to variation in the outcomes and participants of a
              facultative mutualism between ants and larvae of a butterfly (Thisbe irenea) in
              a Panamanian forest. These caterpillars produce nitrogen-rich secretions to
              attract ants in exchange for protection against predation. This study will be
              done using experimental manipulations of light and/or nutrients in common
              gardens in the forest. Other work will involve more controlled settings to
              determine how host plant characteristics affect the growth of the caterpillar.
              The responses of caterpillars and ants to variable plant quality may interact
              to produce a range of outcomes in the ant-caterpillar interaction which help
              explain the conditions for the success of the host plant and the caterpillar.
              It is hoped that understanding how variation in resource availability
              influences interacting members across trophic levels from plants to predators
              will help in unraveling the selection pressures and constraints that shape the
              evolution of multispecies interactions.
