Title: Climate
              Reconstruction in East Asia from Geothermal Data

This SGER award supports
              the acquisition and analysis of borehole temperature data from Russia and
              China, to be used for reconstructing the ground surface temperature history in
              these regions over the past five centuries.  There is reason to believe that
              considerable subsurface temperature data of a quality suitable for climate
              reconstruction exists in both countries.  The derived climate histories will be
              integrated with existing results, to explore several aspects of global and
              regional climatology over the past five centuries.
