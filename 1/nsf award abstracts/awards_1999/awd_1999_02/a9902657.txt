The primary objective of this research is to develop
              methodologies for compativilizing immiscible polymer blends via transition
              metal complexation.  Miscibility occurs when the metal center coordinates to
              ligands in two different polymers.  These polymeric/transition-metal
              coordination complexes are unique because their macroscopic physical properties
              do not follow the simple rule of additivity that is characteristic of weakly
              interacting polymer blends.  The final products exhibit unusual
              thermo-mechanical properties because reactive blending generates a coordination
              crosslink or a covalent linkage between two dissimilar chains.  This is an
              extension of supramolecular design that represents a new frontier in
              interdisciplinary macromolecular science and engineering.  Strategies to
              transform immiscible polymer blends into compatible mixtures via small amounts
              of a transitions of a transition-metal complex are extremely attractive for
              industrial applications where synergistic macroscopic physical properties are
              desired.

The methodologies under investigation in this study represent the
              "next step" in the search for strongly interacting functional polymers, ternary
              blends & complexes.  This research on organic-inorganic hybrid materials will
              contribute significantly to the state-of-the-art in nanotechnology, and offer
              unusually new & useful properties in the final products.
