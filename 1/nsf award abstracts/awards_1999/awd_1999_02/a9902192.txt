The staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis was a dominant
              space-occupier and an important framework constructor of Caribbean coral reefs
              during the Pleistocene and Holocene.  Populations of Acropora have been killed
              throughout the region over the past two decades by outbreaks of white-band
              disease, a presumed bacterial infection.  On lagoonal reefs in Belize, the
              demise of Acropora led to dominance by the lettuce coral Agaricia tenuifolia.
              This Acropora-to-Agaricia transition produced a clear signature in the
              subsurface sediments in Belize, and analysis of cores extracted from these
              reefs showed this sequence of events to be unique in at least the last 3,000
              years.  Similar Agaricia-dominated communities are common today in the Laguna
              de Chiriqui in northwestern Panama, more than 1,000 km from the Belizean reefs.
               Were these reefs also previously dominated by Acropora?  An intensive program
              of coring will reveal whether the Panamanian reefs have a similar Recent
              history to those in Belize.  More important, the cores will be used to
              determine if the mass mortality of Acropora was unique to the Recent, as in
              Belize, or whether similar events occurred in the past.  If the loss of
              Acropora to disease is a new phenomenon, it could be related to accelerating
              human activity in the Caribbean.
