The goal of this research is the continued development and
              application of potential energy functions for polymeric macromolecules that are
              capable of reproducing vibrational frequencies to spectroscopic accuracy.  Such
              a spectroscopically determined force field (SDFF), in addition to providing
              better frequencies, is expected to be more accurate in structure prediction and
              molecular dynamics simulations.  Previous NSF support for this research led to
              the development of an SDFF for saturated hydrocarbon chains, which will now be
              used in several applications: 1) analysis of the low frequency spectra of
              crystalline helical syndiotactic polypropylene, in order to identify different
              types of packing arrangements; 2) a study of the relative stability of this
              form in comparison with the planar zigzag structure, which is also observed; 3)
              a determination of the optimum chain conformation and crystal structure of
              polyisobutylene, which is only partially resolved by x-ray studies.  Continuing
              studies will develop an SDFF for unsaturated hydrocarbon chains.  This SDFF
              will be used to calculate structures and spectra of various forms of trans- and
              cis-1,4-polybutadiene and trans-1,4-polyisoprene.  The results of a parallel
              development of an SDFF for the hydrogen-bonded amide group will be used to
              study structures and spectra of nylons.

The use of such energy functions in
              structural and spectroscopic studies of polymers should result in more accurate
              predictions of their physical properties.  This should enhance the power of
              computational applications in polymer science and engineering, permitting the
              development of more complex and sophisticated materials having designed
              properties.  Such specialty products may not only benefit the economy but can
              be expected to lead to optimum utilization of our natural resources.
