Asexually reproducing species (clones) are considered
              evolutionary dead-ends due to an irreversible accumulation of slightly
              deleterious mutations (mutational meltdown). Despite this expectation, some
              asexual organisms are widespread and abundant. Several mechanisms are believed
              to retard mutational accumulation in an asexual lineage. One mechanism is to
              occasionally mate with a related sexual species and incorporate new gene copies
              that mask or replace mutational defects. The proposed studies will examine
              evidence for gene replacements in asexual lineages of topminnow fishes (genus
              Poeciliopsis). Genetic markers (protein and DNA sequences) will be examined to
              clarify the origin of the asexual lineage, and establish whether its genome
              contains novel genes from a related sexual species.

Now that cloning of
              mammals is no longer a fantasy, scientists must look to natural models to
              assess the long- and short-term risks of asexual reproduction. Fish of the
              genus Poeciliopsis are among the most extensively studied organisms with
              closely related sexual and asexual forms. The proposed project builds on a
              40-year history of genetic, ecological, and evolutionary studies with these
              fish. This study will provide insights on mechanisms that some asexual species
              use to circumvent mutational meltdown and avoid extinction.
