Androdioecy is a breeding system in which  breeding
              populations consist of separate male and hermaphrodite individuals, while
              dioecious populations contain male individuals and female individuals.  Theory
              and phylogenetics suggest that androdioecy is derived from dioecy in Datisca. 
              Furthermore, floral morphology suggests that hermaphrodites are modified
              females, while males have an ancestral form.  The overall goal of this research
              is to understand the evolution of androdioecy from dioecy.  Crosses and
              molecular markers will be used to investigate  the genetic basis of sex
              determination in the androdioecious plant, Datisca glomerata and its dioecious
              sister-species, D. cannabina.  Furthermore,  a search for sex ratio distorters
              will be made in natural populations of dioecious D. cannabina to test the
              possibility that female-biased sex ratios were involved in the evolution of
              androdioecy.

Breeding-system evolution is one of the most tractable and
              best-studied evolutionary processes in plants.  Thus it provides an excellent
              model for evolution as a whole.  Furthermore, because most breeding system
              theory was developed for other breeding systems, androdioecy provides an
              independent test of the rules thought to control breeding system evolution.
              These studies will help explain the genetic processes allowing androdioecy to
              evolve through natural selection in Datisca.  More broadly, they will 
              illuminate the role of genetics in breeding-system evolution and in adaptive
              evolution as a whole.
