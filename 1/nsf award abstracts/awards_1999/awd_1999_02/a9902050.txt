This U.S.-Hungary research project between David Tanner
              of the University of Florida and Katalin Kamaras of the Hungarian Institute for
              Solid State Physics and Optics features sample preparation and use of
              microspectroscopy for in-situ study of air-sensitive materials in an inert gas
              atmosphere. The researchers intend to examine the optical properties of
              fullerenes and fullerene derivatives in crystal and thin film forms.  
              Crystalline samples will be prepared in Budapest and the thin film samples in
              Gainesville.  The intent is to determine the optical functions of several
              phases of fulleride crystals from the far infrared through ultraviolet
              frequency ranges.  Results are expected to improve our understanding of: 1) the
              symmetry of fullerene balls, 2) their electronic structure and chemical
              bonding, and 3) the dynamical properties of mobile charge carriers at
              metal/fullerene interfaces.  This new information should help define a new
              class of superconducting materials.

This materials research project fulfills
              the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in
              the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
