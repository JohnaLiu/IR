Special
              Project: Travel Grant for Faculty at Minority/Female Institutions to attend
              PLDI '99

In an effort to improve the representation of women and minorities
              in computer science, the organizing committee of the 1999 ACM SIGPLAN
              Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI) is inviting
              faculty actively involved with the education of women and minorities to attend
              the1999 PLDI tutorials and conference.  A full day of tutorials is planned for
              educators.  Targeted schools include primarily undergraduate institutions,
              including historically African American colleges, women's colleges, and other
              colleges with large minority enrollments.  This travel grant will provide
              partial support for selected individuals from such institutions to attend and
              participate in the conference and tutorials.  By strengthening faculty
              knowledge of recent research trends and results, the quality of programming
              languages and compiler courses will be improved at these institutions and,
              further, its is expected that interest will be generated among individuals from
              these underrepresented groups such that some of them will consider careers in
              computer science.  For the selected participants, travel and subsistence costs
              are shared between NSF and ACM SIGPLAN and the organization will also provide
              the registration fees for the tutorial and conference.
