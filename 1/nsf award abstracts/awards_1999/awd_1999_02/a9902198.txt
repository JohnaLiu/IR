Plant defenses induced by herbivory are better
              understood than changes in host plant physiology which benefit insects. This
              study will examine the mechanistic bases of the ability of insects to
              manipulate plant physiology to their own advantage. It will use the witch hazel
              cone gall aphid to test hypotheses regarding the aphid's ability to alter
              source-sink relationships and photoassimilate allocation, the mechanism by
              which these alterations are effected, the adaptive value to the insect and the
              negative effects on hostplant biomass allocation and fitness. This area of gall
              biology is not well studied and this proposal has the potential to lead to
              valuable insights to gall forming insects and plant evolutionary biology.
