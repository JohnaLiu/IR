Abstract    :
              The morphological diversity of metazoans contrasts with an apparent lack of
              diversity in the set of genes that pattern animal embryos. This paradox-that
              similar proteins produce different morphologies-has generated the expectation
              that the evolution of these genes, and the evolution of their regulation, can
              generate morphological novelty. The attention to these conserved developmental
              regulatory pathways arose as a passive consequence of the discovery of these
              genes in various model organisms. The PIs now have the opportunity to test the
              hypotheses generated by this initial data set by asking directed questions in a
              more meaningful phylogenetic framework. The PI will  propose two separate
              experimental approaches to address the question of whether certain molecular
              mechanisms that pattern insect and vertebrate embryos operate in the molluscan
              embryo. The oft-noted similarity between embryonic patterning genes across the
              Metazoa is mostly based on data from 2-3 taxa.  The molluscs are
              phylogenetically distant from the "model embryos" and so the similarities and
              differences that the PIs find should enrich hypotheses about the evolutionary
              history of these patterning mechanisms.
