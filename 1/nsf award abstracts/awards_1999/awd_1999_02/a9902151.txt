Abstract    :
              Riparian forests that occur in the Sonoran Desert are important, yet threatened
              ecosystems in the southwestern United States.  In the past one hundred years,
              impoundments and diversions of surface water and removal of ground water for
              human use have contributed to a decline in these ecosystems.  This decline has
              included a loss of native species, such as cottonwood and willow trees, and the
              spread of exotic species, such as saltcedar.  These species rely heavily on
              ground water as a water source, but they may use water from the surface soil if
              ground water is less available.

	Ground water availability in southwestern
              riparian ecosystems can vary dramatically from year to year as a result of
              climatic variations.  The PIs observed significant declines in the health of
              native cottonwoods and willows, but not of the exotic saltcedar, in 1997, a dry
              year, when ground water was less available.  In contrast, no declines in the
              health of any species were observed in 1998, which was a wet year.  The PIs
              plan to use analysis of naturally occurring isotopes of hydrogen in water to
              determine whether native and non-native species used the same water sources,
              and whether water source use differed between the dry and wet years.  This
              information will be helpful in understanding how changes in ground water
              availability by human manipulation and climatic variability affects desert
              riparian forests.
