This project is a proposal for a conference grant, which
              seeks to offer a two-day conference designed as a national forum for discussing
              urban challenges in mathematics education.  The conference will address issues
              related to diversity and meeting individual students' needs, as well as equity
              and opportunity to learn.  It will also provide a forum for designing an action
              plan for strengthening communication among the various parties (i.e. teachers,
              school administrators, university professors, parents, and leaders in business
              and industry) involved in preparing urban students for higher education and the
              workforce.  The conference is co-sponsored by the National Council of Teachers
              of Mathematics (NCTM).  It will be preceded by several months of planning.  A
              book of readings and proceedings will be compiled as a way to disseminate the
              results of the conference. 

The conference will host 600 participants in
              October, 1999.  In particular, urban centers will be the targeted participant
              audience.  Local and national teacher leaders, school administrators,
              mathematics educators, university mathematics faculty, business
              representatives, and parent leaders will be invited to participate in the
              conference.
