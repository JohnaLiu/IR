Abstract    :
              The objective of this study is to determine the mechanism responsible for the
              formation and perpetuation of large and conspicuous rifts and gradients often
              visible in satellite observations of otherwise uniform stratus and
              stratocumulus cloud decks.  A fully instrumented Twin Otter aircraft operated
              by the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS)
              will measure cloud and aerosol properties in and around the cloud-free regions.
               The data will be analyzed with the purpose of producing a physical model of
              the marine boundary layer that explains the formation and longevity of the
              rifts.  Flights will be conducted from Monterey, California.  Results of the
              study will be valuable for modeling aerosol and warm cloud processes,
              understanding the radiative properties of maritime clouds, and for
              interpretation of satellite data.  The project is supported as a collaboration
              between Dr. Albrecht and Drs. Haflidi Jonsson and Philip Durkee at the Naval
              Postgraduate School.
