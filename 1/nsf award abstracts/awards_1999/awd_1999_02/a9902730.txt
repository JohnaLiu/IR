Plate tectonics theory is compatible with major historic
              rearrangements of the continental crust around the surface of the earth,
              including occasional subcontinental assembly that includes most of the
              continental crust in one large landmass.  Recent evidence for a neoproterozoic
              global plate assembly has led to general acceptance of a major reorganization
              of land masses, but the geometry, timing, and mechanism of assembly are
              controversial.  This project is designed to provide crustal formulation and
              assembly data from an area at the heart of the West Gondwana supercontinent,
              now located in southwestern Brazil.  Results of this structural and age-dating
              study are expected to resolve several key issues concerning neoproterozoic
              tectonism that will be of considerable utility in understanding crustal groups
              and supercontinental assembly.
