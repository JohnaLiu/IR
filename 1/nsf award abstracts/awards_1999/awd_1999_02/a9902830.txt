Thewissen
The origin of cetaceans was marked by a number of dramatic
              changes in a whole array of organ systems, and this process is one of the best
              documented examples of major morphological change in the mammalian fossil
              record.  This grant studies evolutionary changes in the oldest, most basal
              cetaceans.  These whales, pakicetids, and are found only in freshwater deposits
              of northwestern India and Pakistan.  This project will investigate the
              paleobiology of pakicetids by testing a suite of hypotheses relating to organ
              system change and its context.  Data will be gathered from paleontological,
              geochemical, and paleomagnetic samples collected in Eocene deposits in northern
              Pakistan and these data will address questions concerning the phylogeny,
              locomotion, hearing, habitat, and trophic level of early cetaceans.
