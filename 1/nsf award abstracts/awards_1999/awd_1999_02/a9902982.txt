Abstract    :
              This proposal (Issues in Diversity:  A Synthesis of the Literature Relevant to
              Mathematics Classrooms Which Promote Understanding) seeks to improve research
              in mathematics education by introducing concepts related to diversity into the
              national debate on mathematics education reform.  The proposal sets out to
              conduct a literature review of mathematics education and diversity drawing upon
              literatures in a diverse set of areas including language and literacy,
              discourse and communication, cultural anthropology, sociology and multicultural
              education.  Fifteen members of an Advisory Panel will advise the PIs (including
              Carol Lee at Northwestern University) on pertinent articles to review, will
              give a series of lectures on diversity issues, and will work with the PIs to
              disseminate the findings arising from the various discussions and archival
              research syntheses.
