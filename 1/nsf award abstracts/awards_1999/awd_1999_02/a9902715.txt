This project involves collecting and study of Early Paleozoic
              brachiopods from numerous localities in Siberia and Central Asia with the
              collaboration of colleagues from Russia and Pakistan.  It is a continuation of 
              work started in eastern Asia that was supported by the National Geographic
              Society. The preparation and description of these diverse brachiopod faunas
              will considerably advance our possibilities for understanding Ordovician,
              Silurian and earlier Devonian biogeographic relations and Early Paleozoic
              paleogeography and continental plate relations in this vast geographic
              region.
