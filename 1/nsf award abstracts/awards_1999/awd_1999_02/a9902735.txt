In young, tectonically active areas extensive
              modeling, constrained by a strong database of geological and geophysical
              parameters, has been used to identify orogenic processes and develop detailed
              geologic histories.  This Project is to apply this tactic to the Oligocene to
              recent history of New Zealand.  New Zealand offers a complex and active
              tectonic regime, and extensive data sets exist.  Results will attempt to match
              the resent structures, crustal thickness and elevation in New Zealand, and test
              the hypothesis that South Island may be a "steady state assembly line" for
              mountain.  Results are expected to illuminate the major parameters involved in
              the various tectonic interactions underway in New Zealand.
