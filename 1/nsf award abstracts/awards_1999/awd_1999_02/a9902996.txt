The underlying objective of this project is to advance the
              understanding of the interactions between various manganese oxide minerals and
              redox active, environmentally important aqueous metals, specifically cobalt and
              chromium.  The specific goals in this study are: to characterize (for the first
              time) the atomic and electronic surface structure of certain manganese oxides
              (manganite, hollandite and pyrolusite) using scanning tunneling microscopy and
              spectroscopy; to describe redox interactions (including oxidation/reduction,
              sorption/desorption, and dissolution processes) between several manganese
              oxides (manganite, hollandite, pyrolusite, and birnessite) and aqueous Co(II)
              and Cr(III) using principally fluid-cell atomic force microscopy, Auger and
              X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, and wet-chemical techniques, as well as
              scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy; and to develop new models for
              these interactions which combine our observations and assessments with the
              excellent store of information already available for many of these aqueous
              metal - mineral interactions.  The research performed in this project will
              allow us to address previously unresolved issues concerning environmentally
              important, redox-mediated mineral-water interface reactions.  Such issues
              include surface heterogeneity, various temporal aspects, the role of
              near-surface absorption and diffusion, and specific structural, chemical, and
              physical factors that control aqueous metal oxidation efficiencies.
