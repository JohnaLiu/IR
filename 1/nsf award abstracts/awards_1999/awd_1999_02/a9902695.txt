Abstract    :
              This project will study factors controlling carbon flux from two tundra types
              that are largely differentiated on the basis of the underlying soil type:
              acidic vs. non-acidic.  The factors leading to flux of carbon from each tundra
              type will be determined in order to examine the role of climate on landscape
              vegetation and subsequent carbon release or sequestration.  A combination of
              field, laboratory, and modeling studies will be preformed to examine the
              factors controlling carbon flux in each tundra soil type.  A model will be
              developed to look at possible future scenarios for warmer climates so that the
              role global warming in the Arctic may be assessed.  The study is critical for
              understanding climate impacts on tundra composition and concomitant carbon flux
              on a regional scale.  Current understanding of tundra soil effects on carbon
              flux are limited to only one soil type in spite of the prevalence of the other
              type as well.
