This exploratory effort
              is focused on the development of a high-speed DNA gene sequencing device.  The
              sequencer is based on electrophoretically pulling single-stranded DNA through a
              nanopore 1-3 nm in diameter.  As the individual nucleotides traverse the
              nanopore, they block, and therefore, modulate the current through the pore. 
              The magnitude of the current modulation is a function of the chemical
              composition of the nucleotide base, i.e., base sequences may be determined by
              their characteristic current signatures.  The key aspect of this exploratory
              effort is the feasibility fabrication of the nanopore by anodic dissolution of
              silicon in HF, e.e., porous silicon.  The nanopores will be active component in
              an integral microdevice design to electrically address the nanopore with sense
              electrodes and data acquisition circuitry.  DNA transport and detection through
              these pores will be demonstrated.
