Abstract    :
              This grant would enable the annual International Conference on Cognitive and
              Neural Systems to continue on May 24-27, 2000 and in May, 2001.  The conference
              focuses on the two general themes:  How Does the Brain Control Behavior?  and
              How Can Technology Enable Biological Intelligence?  The conference would also
              emphasize Learning and Intelligent Systems.  Many conferences are covering
              cognitive or neurobiological data.  A few conferences are covering cognitive or
              neurological models, but not both.  Yet other conferences are covering
              artificial neural networks and other neuromorphic applications .  The Cognitive
              and Neural Systems conference is unique in covering both cognitive and neural
              experiments and models, as well as a range of intelligent applications, and
              doing so within a conference program with a single program track.  The meeting
              was prepared to do this because this is precisely what the CNS graduate program
              at Boston Universitiy was created to do.  The conference will include invited
              tutorials and lectures, and contributed lectures and posters by experts on the
              biology and technology of how the brain and other intelligent systems adapt to
              a changing world.  The conference is aimed at researchers and students of
              computational neuroscience, connectionists cognitive science, artificial neural
              networks, neuromorphic engineering, and artificial intelligence.
