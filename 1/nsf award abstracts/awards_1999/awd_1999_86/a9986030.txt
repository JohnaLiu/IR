Abstract    :
              Hierarchical databases were standard thirty years ago, but have been completely
              supplanted by relational databases since, in spite of hierarchy remaining the
              most common way in which we organize information in other spheres. The goal of
              this research project is to re-evaluate hierarchical databases in the light of
              the progress made in database technology. The thesis is that relational
              databases supplanted hierarchical databases not because flat relations provided
              a superior organization of the data, but rather on account of other crucial
              benefits relational technology provided, namely the separation of data
              organization from application logic and the notion of a declarative query
              language. The approach in this project is to begin with LDAP (Lightweight
              Directory Access Protocol) as a rudimentary hierarchical database, and to
              extend it to provide full-fledged database functionality. The results of this
              project will demonstrate the feasibility and value of building a hierarchical
              database as a far more flexible and scalable structure than the relational
              databases that are prevalent today.
