Abstract    :
              This proposal describes research to search for evidence of a masive neutron
              event that has been postulated to have occured in the Paleo-Indian era.  The
              preliminary observed anomalies are suggested to be explained by a global cosmic
              event involving both micrometeorites and massive neutron irradiation.  The
              postulate is based on preliminary measurements of the relative abundances of
              235, 238U and 239Pu in archaelogically obtained artifacts.  In this work, it is
              porposed that core samples be collected at Michigan sites with soil undisturbed
              over archeological times.  The samples would then be studied my microscope
              (looking for micrometereoritical evidence) and by radioanalysis at LBNL (by
              profiling the amount of Uranium and Plutonium as a function of depth).  It is
              claimed that this would be the first complete radioprofile in North America and
              would provide a baseline measurement about cosmic-induced radioactivity. 
              Establishing a relation between recurrent cosmic events and mass extinction
              would affect a number of scientific fields.
