Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funding to support 40 students of high ability and
              financial need with a $2,500 scholarship award per year for two years to pursue
              studies in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEM). The objective
              of the program is to provide academic opportunities to these students, coming
              from low-income families, who otherwise might not be able to achieve these
              goals, to provide an improved education with academic support courses, and
              improve their retention rate by lowering their employment load. 

A committee
              of key personnel from the CSEM departments at California State University,
              Bakersfield (CSUB) will overlook this program and develop the academic support
              structure, which is necessary to provide encouragement to the students as they
              move towards graduation in their chosen fields or towards transfer to
              Engineering School.
