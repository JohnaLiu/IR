Abstract    :
              This project will generate data on alkenone unsaturation (as an indicator of sea
              surface temperature) and benthic 18 O (as an indicator of ice volume) in
              north/south transects of sediment cores from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans
              spanning intervals of the late and middle Pleistocene.  The goal is to compare
              the spectral relations of SST, ice volume and surface radiation from orbital
              variations under different climate regimes.
