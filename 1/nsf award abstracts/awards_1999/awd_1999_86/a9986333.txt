The PI's propose to create novel nanostructured ceramic
              composites which mimic the structure of pseudolamellar (parallel-fibered) bone.
               These composites will have enhanced toughness and high strength due to the
              arrangement of nanocrystalline ceramic particles within an ordered collagen
              matrix.  Such materials will have specific applications as bone-graft
              substitutes for repair of critical size osseous defects.  In addition, the
              regulation of properties through control of nanostructure will demonstrate a
              general strategy for the development of polymer-ceramic composites for
              structural applications.
