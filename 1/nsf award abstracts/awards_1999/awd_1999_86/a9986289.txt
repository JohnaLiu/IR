Abstract    :
              The overall goal of the proposed research is to create surfaces with a custom,
              nanoscale-imprinted 2-D structure-function relationship. We propose to template
              2-D chemical and charge patterns onto Langmuir monolayers at the air/water
              interface using large protein or non-enveloped virus particles adsorbed from
              the aqueous subphase. We propose to preserve thus created patterns by 2-D
              cross-linking and/or transfer of the monolayer to a suitable solid substrate.
              Furthermore, we propose to test the transferred film for the imprinted memory
              effect by measuring its specificity towards binding of the original templating
              species.   

The specific aims of the research are to show that:   
  
(1)
              lateral reorganization in a multi-component monolayer is induced locally by
              binding of a protein or viral particles from the solution subphase onto the
              monolayer,   

(2) induced local molecular imprints can be preserved by 2-D
              cross-linking and/or transfer of the monolayer to a solid substrate, and  
              

(3) molecular imprints can be (re-)used for specific recognition of the
              original templating particle. 

The proposed research will provide a physical
              picture of the processes responsible for template induction, preservation, and
              specificity through direct, quantitative analysis of local template structure
              and template affinity distribution. The formation of adsorbate-specific
              patterns, or imprints, in monolayers opens the possibility to control the
              material surface design and prepare functional nanosystems that will, when
              placed in a new biological environment, preferentially interact with the
              original templating species.
