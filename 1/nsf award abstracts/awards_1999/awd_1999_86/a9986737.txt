              ABSTRACT

OCE-9986737

In this study, the principal investigator will
              prepare and analyze the global ocean chlorophyll-a fields derived from four
              different satellite ocean color sensors - the Coastal Zone Color Scanner
              (CZCS), the Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (OCTS), the Polarization and
              Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances sensor (POLDER), and the Sea Wide
              Field Sensor (SeaWiFS).  The overall objective is to assess and implement
              strategies for scaling these satellite data and models to seasonal, annual, and
              interannual time scales and to regional and global spatial scales", one of the
              primary goals of the Synthesis and Modeling Project of the U.S. Joint Global
              Ocean Flux Study (U.S.JGOFS).  The subobjectives are:  (1) to put the sensor
              imagery on a common global grid at 0.25 degree resolution and at roughly weekly
              temporal resolution; (2) to do the same at monthly resolution; (3) to compare
              the fields;  (4) to select one or more ocean basins for more detailed
              comparisons of satellite-derived chlorophyll-a spatial and temporal
              variability; and (5) to create satellite chlorophyll-a time series for large
              ocean regions.  The principal investigator will work with other ocean
              scientists to assure that they are aware of the remote sensing chlorophyll-a
              databases available to them as well as the strengths and limitations of those
              databases.
