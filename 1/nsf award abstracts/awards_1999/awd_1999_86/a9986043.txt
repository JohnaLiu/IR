              Instrumentation: CONFIGURABLE OFF-THE SHELF MULTITHREADED EXPERIMENTAL TESTBED
              (COMET)

The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
              University of Delaware will purchase FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)
              design boards, a Beowulf cluster of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) PC's and
              necessary accessories such as an oscilloscope.  The FPGA units will form the
              Multithreaded Operator for Of-the shelf Nodes (MOON), which will be used for
              prototyping multithreading enhancements to COTS-based machines.  The PC cluster
              will provide a baseline for comparing the performance of enhanced and
              non-enhanced clusters.  The combination of the MOON cards and the cluster will
              form COMET.  The test equipment will permit the development of a custom
              interconnect between the MOON board, and will be used for observing and
              debugging high-speed signals.

This equipment will be used to test the
              thesis, supported by previous simulations, that a fine-grain multithreading
              model supporting both regular and irregular applications can be implemented on
              COTS systems if a small amount of custom hardware is used to support the
              operations specific to the multithreading model.  The Moon would provide a
              flexible and multi-faceted prototyping system for verifying these results in
              real system, and for supporting other, more advanced multithreading models,
              which are specific to ongoing research projects.
