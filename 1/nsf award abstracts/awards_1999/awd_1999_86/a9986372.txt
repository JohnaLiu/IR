Michigan State University is revising the "Connected
              Mathematics Project (CMP)" materials designed for middle school students.  In
              preparation for the revision, critical reviews of the first-edition materials
              are being sought from mathematicians, teachers, technology experts and
              education researchers.  Additionally, student achievement data is being
              collected to assess the depth of understanding and proficiency with fractions,
              decimals, percents and integers that students are developing.  The author team
              uses this input and the experience gained from implementation of the first
              edition to revise the student texts, teacher resource materials, assessment
              materials and implementation materials.  Materials for the professional
              development of teachers are also being developed.  Prior to publication, every
              unit is to be critically reviewed by a mathematician, two other authors and
              five experienced teachers.
