              Instrumentation: Network Computing Testbed for Interactive Visualization,
              Multimedia, and Metacomputing  

The Department of Computer and Information
              Science at the Ohio State University will purchase a network computing testbed
              (consisting of a set of Quad SMP Pentium systems, Gigabit Ethernet and Myrinet
              interconnects for intra-cluster communication, ATM interconnect for
              intra-cluster and WAN connectivity, a RAID File system, a set of 3D accelerator
              boards, and a video wall), which will be dedicated to support research in
              computer and information science and engineering.  The equipment will be used
              for several research projects, including in particular:

Scalable
              Communication and Synchronization Support on SMP Clusters for
              Metacomputing.

A High Performance Image-Based Warehouse Across Heterogeneous
              Environment

Parallel Visualization and Display of Tera-scale Data
              

Multimedia Processing and Networking on SMP Clusters
