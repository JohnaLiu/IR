Abstract    :
              (31) This project enables talented but financially disadvantaged students to
              pursue an undergraduate degree in computer science on a full-time basis.
              Special emphasis is placed on the recruitment of two classes of students
              underrepresented in computer science, namely, women and ethnic minorities, with
              particular emphasis placed on Native Americans. A collaborative partnership
              between the Department of Computer Science at the university, Minnesota's
              tribal college and several northeastern community colleges, and the regional
              computer industry supports this endeavor. The project results in an
              infrastructure that attracts talented students in northeastern Minnesota and
              prepares them for careers in computer science. Although this project centers on
              computer science, the model to be implemented is applicable to any area of
              science and engineering. The infrastructure emphasizes academic preparation in
              computer science, encourages student achievement, and provides scholarships,
              mentoring programs, transition programs, and opportunities for internships and
              collaborative research with Computer Science faculty. The project focuses on
              the retention of students in the program, ensuring their continued academic
              success, and professional placement on receipt of the baccalaureate.
