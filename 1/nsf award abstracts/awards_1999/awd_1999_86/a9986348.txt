Abstract

Cutting and pasting DNA strands using the tip of a
              computer-controlled Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) as a robot is proposed. DNA
              robotics is a step towards the development of cell surgery, which is the long
              term goal of the work. It is envisaged programmable nanometer-scale robots (or
              larger devices with nanoscopic end effectors) interacting with cell components
              so as to repair them. Surgery on single cells would be of scientific interest
              in itself, since it would provide unprecedented capabilities for experimental
              studies of cell function and behavior. It also would be of great clinical
              interest if one could use cells' natural reproductive mechanisms to generate
              large numbers of correctly-functioning cells from a robotically-manipulated
              prototype.  If nanorobots were mass-produced so that swarms of them could be
              deployed to treat a patient.

The research with focus on recognizing sites in
              a DNA strand in vitro, and it modifying it by cutting and glueing. This project
              is highly interdisciplinary, and could not be successfully undertaken without
              the infrastructure of people, know-how and equipment provided by USC's
              Laboratory for Molecular Robotics. Faculty, postdocs and students from various
              departments have been collaborating effectively for several years, and all the
              necessary facilities are available.
