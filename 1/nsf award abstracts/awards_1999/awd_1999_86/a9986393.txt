Abstract    :
              This project is to explore the potential use of nanogels for incorporation of
              oppositely charged low molecular mass molecules and proteins.  Self-assembly of
              nanogel particles with surfactants and proteins is to be characterized.  A
              result of this project is to be a new class of functional nanosystems as
              potential carriers 
for biologically active compounds.
