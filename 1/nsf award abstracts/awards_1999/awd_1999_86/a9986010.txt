CISE Research
              Instrumentation: High-Speed Motion Acquisition

The Departments of Computer
              Science and Mechanical Engineering will purchase 2 high-speed multi-camera
              setups, a RAID videodisk, and 2 Pentium PC's and an animation software package.
               This equipment will be dedicated to the support of research in computer and
              information sciences and engineering.  The equipment will be used for several
              research areas including, in particular, projects addressing:

   Anterior
              Cruciate Ligament-Functional Biocmechanics
   Human Motion Models for Tracking
              and Activity Interpretation
   3D Motion Acquisition for the Stanford
              Immersive Television Project
   Animation of realistic and believable
              characters

The general thrust of these efforts is to develop high-quality
              acquisition and analysis techniques of human movements.
