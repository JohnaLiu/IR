Abstract    :
              The proposed NSF Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships
              Program (NSF 99-121) at Enterprise State Junior College has as its primary goal
              to deliver a project designed to inspire motivation in academically talented
              program participants to complete a college core curriculum and graduate with
              degrees in computer science, engineering, or mathematics. The goal is for each
              participant to enter and succeed in these programs of postsecondary education
              at the two-year college level. These student given the financial assistance and
              opportunity to study in these fields, are graduating with the two-year terminal
              degree in these areas, and/or are transfer to four-year colleges or
              universities and complete their degrees in one of these three programs. 

The
              NSF Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships Program is
              achieving ten objectives: (1) to recruit, with emphasis on minorities and
              women, 50 computer science, engineering, or mathematics students and evaluate
              their eligibility requirements for receiving scholarships from this program;
              (2) to conduct a student orientation for participants; (3) to assess the
              academic, educational and communication skills of 100% of selected participants
              and prepare an Individual Educational Plan each; (4) to advise 100% of the
              program participants to enroll and to continue in courses in their majors and
              secure an articulation agreement with a senior university, if transferring; (5)
              to provide instruction, tutoring, mentoring and other support services to 100%
              of participants, resulting in 70% achieving a minimum 2.5 grade point average
              each term; (6) to administer the ACT ASSET placement test to 100% of the
              program participants with preparatory course work required if necessary; (7) to
              provide academic and support services to 100% of project participants resulting
              in 80% of the scholarship recipients being retained in the program until
              graduation and/or transfer; (8) to graduate 75% of NSF Computer Science,
              Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships Program in the top 30% of their
              graduating class; (9) to have program participants intending to transfer
              complete the application process to a minimum of three universities or
              four-year colleges, resulting in 85% of them being admitted and declaring the
              appropriate major at a four-year college or university; and, (10) to conduct
              formative and summative evaluations throughout the project period, and annual
              follow-up on 100% of NSF Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics
              Scholarships Program students placed in jobs or transferring to senior level
              institutions; the follow-up will show that 70% of all students placed completed
              their two-year and /or four year degree program within normal time for their
              program.
