Abstract    :
              This project conducts theoretical and experimental research in an area of
              applied mechanism design, i.e., contracting solutions to externality problems.
              Many economic problems such as the prisoner's dilemma, the tragedy of the
              commons, and free riding on a public good have the property that there is a
              unique efficient outcome but the Nash equilibrium outcomes are inefficient. We
              propose a theoretical investigation of when types of simple pre-play contracts,
              such as "matching contributions," can emerge as an endogenous mechanisms and
              resolve the inefficiency. This will help to predict in which economic
              environments individuals will reach an efficient outcome, and what type of
              legal and informational requirements are necessary to do so.
