The principle investigator proposes to study
              the meter to kilometer scale turbulence that occurs in the E region in order to
              answer a number of longstanding questions about the electrodynamics of this
              important region of the atmosphere.  Previous research by the PI has helped
              further understanding of the dynamics of this region through a combination of
              kinetic simulations, theory, and close evaluation of observational data.  This
              research will lead to a more complete description of electrojet dynamics and
              explain a number of measurements which have long puzzled aeronomers.  Further,
              it will provide opportunities to train a number of students, both graduate and
              undergraduate, and a post-doctoral researcher in the geosciences.
