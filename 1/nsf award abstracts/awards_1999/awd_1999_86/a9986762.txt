Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

OCE-9986762


In this project investigators at Texas A & M
              University will analyze optical data from almost forty cruises made during the
              U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (U.S.JGOFS) and the World Ocean Circulation
              Experiment to compile a computerized database of particulate organic carbon
              measurements.  These data will be made available to the scientific community
              for the purpose of modeling various aspects of the ocean carbon cycle and for
              evaluating the output of existing ocean carbon models.  The research team also
              plans to compare these data with backscattering data obtained via
              earth-observing satellites in order to produce a global assessment of the
              particulate organic carbon field in the ocean using satellite observations.
