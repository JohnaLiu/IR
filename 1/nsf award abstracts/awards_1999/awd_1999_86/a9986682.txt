Abstract    :
              This GOALI project focuses on in-situ, real-time studies of complex oxide thin
              film composition, structure, and properties to be used to optimize film quality
              and to develop film formation models that optimize desired film properties.  A
              unique process and characterization system combining spectroscopic ellipsometry
              and low energy ion scattering, together with a multi target ion beam sputter
              deposition system for film growth is being completed.  This GOALI project
              involving systems development requires not only the diverse scientific talents
              provided by the University of North Carolina and James Madison University (an
              undergraduate institution) and Argonne National laboratories, but also
              industrial participation for the industrial hardware implementation
              phase.

Oxide films with both complex compositions and structures are being
              considered for the next generation electronic and optical devices.  Among the
              classes materials currently being emphasized are highly optimized thin films of
              superconductors, high dielectric constant dielectrics, ferroelectrics and
              piezoelectrics.  Training students for job opportunities in these areas is
              regarded as a high priority by industry.
