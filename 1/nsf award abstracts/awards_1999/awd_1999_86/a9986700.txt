              Duda 9986700

Funds are provided to deploy 8 isobaric Shearmeter floats in the
              Guiana Basin and track these for 10 months.  The floats will measure the
              velocity shear and temperature difference across the height of the floats, 10
              m, as well as the mean temperature and pressure at the depth of the float. 
              This information will be used to infer the time variability of diapycnal mixing
              at the depth of the floats.  The floats will be deployed on 3 pressure surfaces
              (4000 db, 3500 db, and 3000 db) over rough topography and at the two deeper
              levels over smooth topography.  The aim of the study is to improve
              understanding of diapycnal mixing under varying environmental conditions.  The
              project will collaborate with the Guiana Abyssal Gyre Experiment (GAGE) and the
              Meridional Overturning Experiment (MOVE).
