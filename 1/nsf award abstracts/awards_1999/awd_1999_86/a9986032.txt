Instrumentation Grant
              for Research in Parallel and Distributed Computing

The Parallel and
              Distributed Computing Laboratory at the University of Georgia, established in
              1998 is dedicated to making parallel computing simple, portable, and efficient.
               The activities of the laboratory include designing and implementing efficient
              parallel algorithms, developing highly configurable environments for the
              monitoring, visualization, and interactive steering of distributed programs,
              and developing lower-level systems that transparently and dynamically determine
              how to distribute data across processors.  Currently research in the laboratory
              is primarily done on networks of commodity uniprocessor workstations.  The
              attractive price/performance ration of small, bus-based multiprocessors
              relative to uniprocessors makes it likely that two-and four-way multiprocessors
              will be commonplace within a few years.  Still, to create large parallel
              machines, these multiprocessors will be networked together to create a hybrid
              (both shared-and distributed-memory) machine.  This poses interesting problems,
              including (1) should the machine be treated as distributed or both shared and
              distributed. (2) How do we make full use of such machines and (3) how can a
              user monitor and control program on such machines?  The Department of computer
              Science at the University of Georgia seeks funds to purchase eight
              Pentium-based multiprocessors with four processors each.  A 100Mb/s Ethernet
              and an SGI fronted to serve as a console for visualization and interactive
              control.  This equipment will be used by three projects.
