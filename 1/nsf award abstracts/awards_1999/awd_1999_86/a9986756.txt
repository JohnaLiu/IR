This conference "Structure and Mechanism of Membrane
              Transport Proteins"
Is the annual symposium of the Society for General
              Physiologists and will be held at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole,
              September 7-9, 2000.  The meeting will address the recent confluence of
              high-resolution molecular structures with functional mechanistic analyses of
              membrane transporters: ion channels, primary active transport pumps, and
              secondary transporters.  The meeting was organized in response to the
              appearance in the past two years of novel structures of membrane transporters,
              an immensely exciting development for the transport field.  The meeting will
              bring together scientists working on the front lines of membrane transport
              mechanisms with the structural biologists who are cracking the problem of
              structure determination for integral membrane transport proteins.
