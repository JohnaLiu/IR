Abstract    :
              Johnson
The normal development of vertebrate organisms requires the careful
              orchestration of events at the molecular level.  As a result, factors that
              regulate gene expression play critical roles in biological processes such as
              cellular specification, morphogenesis, and growth. These factors, known as
              transcriptional regulators, have been grouped together into families based on
              their similarities in structure and function, and several members of the
              helix-loop-helix (HLH) family are known to be required for mammalian
              development. HLH factors have been shown to affect brain, eye, and neuronal
              development, normal pancreatic functioning, macrophage differentiation, and
              skeletal muscle development.  This project lays the foundation for further
              investigation into the exact role of HLH factors in developmental regulation. 
              By using the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, as a model system, this project
              will involve (1) the identification of all of the HLH factors in C. elegans
              through database searches of the C. elegans  genome, (2) the determination of
              the biological function of a small subset of predicted HLH factors through
              dsRNA interference assays in wild type animals and in animals carrying reporter
              constructs, and (3) the determination of the expression pattern of those
              factors through in situ hybridization studies. The completion of the planning
              stage of the project will provide preliminary data needed to develop a
              detailed, mechanistic and molecular characterization of HLH factors that
              regulate a specific developmental process.  This work will ultimately lead to a
              biochemical and genetical analysis of the interactions between tissue-specific
              transcription factors during cellular specification.
