Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports the research of Professor John F. Hartwig at  Yale University.  The
              project seeks to uncover unusual reactions and fundamental principles in the
              chemistry of metal-boryl and borane complexes.  In particular, a process has
              been discovered in which an alkane reacts with a borane reagent to provide
              linear, terminal alkylboronate esters.  Synthetic and  mechanistic studies of
              this process will be pursued. Polyhydrides and labile alkane complexes will be
              used to develop catalytic functionalization of alkanes. By varying the
              substituents on the boryl ligand the effect of Lewis acidity and sigma basicity
              of the boryl ligand on the alkane chemistry will be assessed. 

Organoboranes
              are among the most versatile synthetic intermediates in chemistry because they
              can be converted to a variety of functionalized molecules. These are useful in
              molecular recognition, as enzyme inhibitors, as neutron capture agents for
              chemotherapy, and as materials that emit blue light. This project will develop
              new routes to these species and explore their chemical properties with respect
              to their ability to induce reactions or normally unreactive carbon-hydrogen
              bonds.
