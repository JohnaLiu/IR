Cowan, John
"The Age, Formation, & Evolution of the Elements in the
              Oldest Stars"
AST-9986974

This project investigates the age, formation and
              evolution of radioactive elements as a means of estimating the ages of the
              oldest stars known.  The PI will use recent improvements in nuclear reaction
              and decay rates to derive expected abundances for radioactive elements in
              low-metallicity stars, particularly thorium, uranium and the s- and r-process
              elements.  The abundance patterns determined for real stars will be compared
              with these new nucleosynthesis calculations for late stages of stellar
              evolution.  The results are likely to provide hard limits on the ages for our
              Galaxy and the Universe.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF
              program for Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
