CISE Research Instrumentation:
              System Support for Scalable, Fault-Tolerant Computing and Service on PC
              Clusters

A high-end PC cluster is the crucial computing infrastructure for
              research in the recently established Distributed Computing Laboratory (DISCO
              Lab) in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University.  The
              requested cluster consists of 8 quad-processor PCs, a 16-port Alteon Gb/s
              Ethernet LAN with layer 4 switching capabilities and a 16 NICs, and a 16-port
              Myrinet Gb/s LAN with 8 NICs.  This cluster will support research in several
              projects that jointly, are intended to improve the state-of-the-art in cluster
              computing, moving towards the realization of a robust and efficient distributed
              computing environment for clusters of PCs.  In particular, this proposal
              describes four projects: (i) developing a robust software distributed
              shared-memory environment to support emerging cluster applications, (ii)
              building system support for efficient global utilization of cluster resources
              (iii) exploring the construction of highly available operating systems, and
              (iv) implementing distributed applications such as data mining, scalable
              servers, and interactive continuous media applications and system mechanisms
              and policies to support them efficiently on clusters.
