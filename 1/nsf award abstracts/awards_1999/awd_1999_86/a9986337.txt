Abstract    :
              Laser postionization methods are used to detect and identify neutral species
              desorbing from surfaces bombarded with energetic ions in this research project
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  Professor Nicholas 
              Winograd's group at the Pennsylvania State University is investigating the
              basic processes of ion induced desorption and the dynamics of matrix assisted
              desorption and ionization of species from molecular surfaces.  The research
              focusses on the use of these methods for the compositional and structural
              characterization of organic, polymeric, and biological surfaces.  Both
              fundamental understanding and method development are goals of this research
              project.  Experimental measurements are combined with state of the art
              computational studies of the trajectories of the desorbed ions, to provide a
              more complete understanding of the ion induced desorption process. 

The
              structural characterization of molecular surfaces is essential to developing an
              understanding of the properties of materials ranging from polymeric surfaces to
              biological membranes.  The goal of this research project at the Pennsylvania
              State University is to develop the basic understanding that is needed to
              implement ion desorption mass spectrometry and ion imaging methods for the
              characterization of these important material surfaces.  A combination of
              fundamental research and method development characterizes this project.
