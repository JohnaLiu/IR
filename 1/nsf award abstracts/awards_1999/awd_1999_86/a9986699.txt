Abstract    :
              The triple photoionization of Li is studied experimentally using  synchrotron
              radiation.  The issue is to explore the Wannier threshold laws governing the
              three electron continuum.  Other photoionization studies of a number of atoms
              and molecules are proposed which will be carried out by light sources here in
              the US and abroad.
