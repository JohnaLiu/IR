Whereas considerable research has been devoted to the
              study of individual preferences, both from empirical and theoretical
              standpoints, the evolution of preferences over time has been given only scant
              attention.  The proposed research focuses on this question.  Various classes of
              preference relations (total orders, partial orders, semiorders, biorders, etc.)
              are regarded as special cases of the abstract concept of a "medium", i.e., a
              particular kind of semigroup of transformations on a set of states.  The
              research will develop the algebraic and stochastic aspects of media theory, and
              will apply the results to substantial data, such as the evolution of opinions
              regarding candidates in an important election.

The study of opinions and
              their evolution over time is a natural concern in a democratic country.  It is
              important to develop scientific tools capable of faithfully interpreting the
              judgements expressed by the members of a community regarding critical issues. 
              The aim of the research is to make such tools not only available, but also easy
              to use.  The results will provide, among other benefits, more accurate
              techniques for the analysis of opinion polls.
