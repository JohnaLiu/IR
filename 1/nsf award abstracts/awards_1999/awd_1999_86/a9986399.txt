Abstract    :
              
The distribution of Rare Earth Elements (REEs) depends on the redox behavior
              of the environment. Therefore, past oceanographic conditions might be
              elucidated by studying the REE content of foraminifera in deep sea sediments.
              This has proven to be a difficult analytical task however because this set of
              elements is prone to contamination, and it is difficult to clean the foram
              shells to assure artifact-free interpretation. This work will utilize a newly
              developed flow-through leaching technique which hopefully will solve this
              difficult analytical problem.  The technique will utilize automated ion
              chromatography interfaced to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer
              (ICPMS).
