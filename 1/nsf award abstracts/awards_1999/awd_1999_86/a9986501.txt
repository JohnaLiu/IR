Abstract    :
              This investigation surveys local-level activists in the Democratic and
              Republican parties, in each of the eleven southern states, through a mail
              questionnaire.  The project complements a similar survey, the Southern
              Grassroots Activists project conducted in 1991.  By collecting similar data in
              2001, the investigators produce a data set that is of great interest to
              scholars interested in political parties and southern politics.

The research
              is organized in a manner similar to the 1991 project.  The investigators are
              responsible for:  1) overall project management and coordination; 2) the
              construction and production of the questionnaire; 3) the coding and processing
              of the data; 4) preparation of the codebook and the data set for dissemination;
              and, 5) editing three volumes that represent the immediate published work from
              the project.  The research team also includes state investigators in each of
              the eleven states who:  A) construct the sampling frames; B) conduct the mail
              surveys of party activists; C) collect related contextual data; and, D) analyze
              the data and contribute chapters to the three edited volumes.  The research
              team for this project includes many of the individuals who were involved in the
              1991 study.

While the project would produce a data set suitable for a
              variety of uses by the scholarly community, two major theoretical concerns
              guide the research:  a) investigating the nature of and relationship between
              inter-party and intra-party conflict; and b) investigating the organizational
              development and change that has taken place in both parties in the region. 
              Both concerns are related to the work done by the 1991 project, but this
              project goes well beyond the original study in its investigation of these two
              areas.  Being able to compare activists at two points in time gives us
              substantial leverage over a variety of research questions.

This study and
              the data are of use to other scholars interested in this topic.
