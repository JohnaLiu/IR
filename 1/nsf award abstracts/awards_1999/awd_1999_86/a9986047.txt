Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will
              develop an improved understanding of electrothermal vaporization (ETV). The
              project, led by Professor James Holcombe of the University of Texas at Austin
              will lead to improved ETV that will be used as a sample introduction system for
              inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses. Direct
              performance improvements will result in multi-element analyses from a single
              vaporization, a multiplexed system for increased throughput, and optimized
              sample transport.  Also, fundamental studies using transmission electron
              microscopy (TEM), high energy electron diffraction (HEED) as well as Monte
              Carlo modeling methods will characterize and determine the importance of
              parameters that control relative ionization/ion transport efficiency of
              analytes. Improvements in ultratrace level analysis of will result from  this
              research 

This project will develop improvements in  ultratrace analysis by
              improving the sample introduction system for inductively coupled plasma-mass
              spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses.  This will increase the ability to detect trace
              impurities in environmental and other samples.
