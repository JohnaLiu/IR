Abstract    :
              The pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain, receives one of the
              highest blood flows of any organ and its capillaries have unique properties
              that facilitate the exchange of substances between hormone-producing cells and
              the circulation. One growth factor, named vascular endothelial growth factor
              (VEGF), maintains the integrity of the vasculature, stimulates growth of new
              blood vessels and affects vascular permeability.  Little is known which
              pituitary cell type produces VEGF, how its production is regulated, whether
              there is a constant remodeling of the pituitary capillaries and what are the
              mechanisms that control permeability, thereby affecting the rate of hormone
              release.  The first aim will identify the pituitary cell types that produce
              VEGF as well as peripheral and brain-derived hormones that control its
              synthesis. The second aim will determine whether locally-produced VEGF binds to
              nearby capillaries, inducing them to form gaps through which hormones and other
              molecules can be exchanged. 

The pituitary is the master endocrine gland
              which regulates growth, reproduction and metabolism.  By incorporating
              knowledge gained from other vascular systems, together with the use of
              state-of-the-art cellular and molecular techniques, this research will generate
              new information on the physiological regulation and proper function of the
              pituitary gland and will provide an attractive training environment for a new
              generation of scientists.
