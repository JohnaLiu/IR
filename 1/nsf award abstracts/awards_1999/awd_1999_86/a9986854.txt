"Design" is an aspect of the science standards with which
              middle school teachers have little experience, and where the professional
              development need is acute.  "Science by Design" takes this need as its starting
              point. Its focus is to upgrade the content and pedagogical knowledge of science
              teachers' knowledge in design-based science.  The primary approach is to create
              eight videotaped vignettes of design in action based on exemplary design-based
              curricula.  They will illustrate exemplary teachers and are based on prototypic
              design curricula developed in the United States and in Britain.  The vignettes
              can be utilized in professional development meetings to engage teachers in
              reflective talk.  Beyond videos, the project will produce supporting CD-ROM and
              paper-based professional development materials that provide commentary by
              internationally known engineering design and technology experts on the design
              process, the culture of design, and pitfalls one can expect in teaching design
              in classrooms.  To integrate design activities into their classrooms
              successfully, teachers engage in activities that help them acquire expert
              knowledge in using design-based science to challenge students.  That knowledge
              is anchored in exemplary curriculum materials and on prototypic demonstrations.
               In turn, these teachers then help their students to acquire scientific
              expertise by constructing scientific knowledge through insights provided by the
              design process.
