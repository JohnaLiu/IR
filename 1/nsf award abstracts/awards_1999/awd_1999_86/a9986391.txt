Abstract    :
              Understanding the process of cell-fate determination is fundamental to
              understanding the ontogeny of an organism.  The long term goal of this project
              is to understand how cell-fate decisions are made and coordinated on the
              developing plant epidermis.  During the process of Arabidopsis leaf
              development, plant protodermal cells must pass through a limited number of
              switch points on the way to a mature tissue system.  One of those switches
              determines whether a cell will become a trichome (hair) cell.  In Arabidopsis
              thaliana, genetic studies indicate important roles for TTG1, GL1 and GL3 in
              regulating this cell-fate decision.
	Recent preliminary work has determined
              that GL3 encodes a basic-Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) myc-type protein with homology
              to the anthocyanin regulator, R, from maize.  Much like R overexpression, GL3
              overexpression leads to supernumerary trichome production in wild type plants
              and it will suppress mutations in TTG1, a WD40 repeat containing protein. 
              However, unlike R, GL3 is a weak suppressor of the trichome defect indicating
              that GL3 normally requires TTG1 for full functionality.  Also like R, GL3 will
              interact with GL1, a myb-type protein, in transgenic plants overexpressing
              both.  Yeast 2-hybrid studies indicate that GL3 interacts with GL1 through its
              amino region outside of the bHLH domain and that GL3 interacts with TTG1
              through a separate amino region domain. However, GL1 does not interact with
              TTG1.  GL3 can also homodimerize and heterodimerize with other bHLH proteins
              through the bHLH region.
	In order to test hypotheses about how
              protein-protein interactions uncovered in the 2-hybrid analysis may mediate the
              regulation of GL3 by TTG1, further work will focus on defining the expression
              patterns and subcellular locations of TTG1 and GL3 in wild type and mutant
              plants.
	While the ttg1-1 and gl1-1 mutations are almost completely devoid of
              trichomes, the gl3 mutations make fewer trichomes than wild type that are less
              well developed.  In addition to GL3, there is at least one other highly
              homologous bHLH gene in Arabidopsis that is able to suppress ttg1 when
              overexpressed and make the same interactions as GL3.  Genetic experiments will
              be employed to try to determine whether GL3 is a partially redundant locus or
              that the gl3 mutations are not null.
	The understanding of how cell-fate
              decisions are regulated is fundamental to the understanding of development in
              general and the present studies will add to the rapidly expanding
              knowledge-base in this area.
