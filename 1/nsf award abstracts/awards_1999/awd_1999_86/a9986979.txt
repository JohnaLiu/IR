Abstract    :
              This project is a  scholarship program for students seeking degrees in Applied
              Mathematics, Mathematics, Computer Science and all fields of Engineering. The
              university has academically strong, accredited degree programs in these areas
              and thus can provide high quality training to students who can gain access to
              it.  This campus has an enormous demand for mathematics and engineering
              scholarship money which it cannot come close to meeting. At the same time, they
              have several programs in place aimed at assisting students who fall into
              categories underrepresented in these fields but they are severely limited
              financially. The NSF scholarship program substantially improves the financial
              situation of many of these students.
