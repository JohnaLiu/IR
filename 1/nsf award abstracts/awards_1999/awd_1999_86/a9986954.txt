The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that
              astrocytes dynamically modulate synaptic transmission within the CNS. A
              conditional knockout of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5),
              a receptor subtype known to modulate synaptic transmission in the hippocampus,
              will be made.  This receptor subtype is known to be important in the
              development of long term potentiation (LTP), a process thought to be involved
              in learning and memory. To accomplish this, the Cre/loxP system that enables
              gene knockout in a cellular and temporally-restricted manner will be
              used.

Astrocytes comprise about 50% of the mammalian brain and their
              processes ensheathe most neuronal synapses.  Historically, astrocytes generally
              have been considered to be passive cells primarily involved in maintaining an
              environment conducive for neuronal function.  However, recent studies indicate
              that astrocytes in situ not only exhibit neurotransmitter receptors but also
              release neurotransmitters in a calcium-dependent manner. Several laboratories,
              including our own, have reported that astrocytes in situ respond to
              synaptically released neurotransmitter.  Further, most neurotransmitters known
              to modulate synaptic efficacy activate astrocytic receptors in the same
              synaptic field. Importantly, a large percentage of the different
              neurotransmitters released in brain are involved in modulating synaptic
              transmission. The picture emerging is that astrocytes exhibit properties that
              would enable them to actively participate in synaptic transmission and play an
              important role in modulating synaptic transmission.  A definitive demonstration
              that astrocytes in situ actively modulate synaptic transmission via a
              receptor-dependent process would markedly change our view of neurotransmission
              within brain.
