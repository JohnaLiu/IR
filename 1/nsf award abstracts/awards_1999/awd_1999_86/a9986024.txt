CISE Research Instrumentation:
              System Support for Mobile and Embedded Workloads

This proposal seeks funding
              to deploy a wireless infrastructure in the Computer Science Department at Duke
              University.  

The requested infrastructure will be used as a testbed for our
              research.  The individual research results will be combined to provide a
              coherent system for the deployment of mobile and embedded applications.  A goal
              of this research is to evaluate the success of the individual system components
              by demonstrating the viability of the disaster recovery application, in effect
              approximating next generation environments using currently available
              technology.    In addition to these research results, the requested
              infrastructure will aid the department's continuing efforts into education and
              outreach.  The equipment will serve as the basis of a project-oriented course
              to develop applications and system support for the infrastructure and will also
              serve as the basis for summer internship projects in Duke's continuing outreach
              efforts to underrepresented groups.
