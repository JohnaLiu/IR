Abstract    :
              The Computer Science program seeks $154,000 from the Computer Science,
              Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship Program for academic years 2000 and
              2001 to provide scholarships for 30 high-achieving Computer Science students
              and to support the implementation of a formal student-support system for all
              Computer Science students in a project whose goals are: 
To improve the
              education of Computer Science students; 
To increase the retention of Computer
              Science students; 
To improve Computer Science students' preparation for
              employment or graduate school; 
To strengthen the Computer Science program's
              ties to business and industry sectors. 

To attain these goals, the Project
              Director will work with a Task Force to identify and recruit high-achieving,
              low-income students and implement plans to support students through the use of
              cohorts, mentors, and an internship program.  The scholarships will relieve
              students of some of the burden of funding their education and thereby provide
              them more time and energy to focus on a rigorous and challenging course of
              study.  Class cohorts mentored by upper-level scholarship recipients will
              provide students a support group to whom they can turn for assistance.  Faculty
              advisors will serve as mentors and provide students guidance with regard to
              academic issues or performance, including but not limited to, focus,
              motivation, communication skills, or career decisions. The support system will
              help assure that students remain "on track" and complete degrees in a timely
              manner. The Internship Program will assist students in understanding workplace
              needs and in strengthening the links between the University and business and
              industry.
