The departments of
              Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of California,
              Santa Barbara will purchase the following infrastructure equipment:  an SGI
              2100 multimedia server with three client SFI 02 workstations to manage, process
              and stream multimedia data onto a wireless local area network with several PC's
              on the backbone Ethernet and mobile computers (laptop computers and handheld
              devices); an MPEG-2 encoder from Optivision, still and video cameras as input
              devices, and high resolution monitors and a color laser printer for display and
              presentation.    This equipment will be dedicated to support research in
              computer and information science and engineering with the main focus on
              computational multimedia research related to multimedia signal processing,
              databases, networking and communications.  The equipment will be used by
              several interrelated research projects.  These projects include: clustering,
              indexing, and data mining in high dimensional feature spaces; scalable audio
              and video over IP and wireless networks; data warehousing in mobile
              environments; and shared multimedia objects in mobile environments.
