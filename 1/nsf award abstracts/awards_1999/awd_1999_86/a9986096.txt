Abstract    :
              The molecular mechanism of interference (the reduction of the rate of  crossing
              over between  some chromosomes) is not known.  It has been suggested that the
              meiotic synaptonemal complex (SC) is involved in mediating interference. 
              Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanism of interference might be
              gained by investigating the yeast S. cerevisiae SC. This project will examine
              the dynamics of SC formation in wild type and ndt80 mutant cells and identify
              the proteins and genes encoding these proteins.  SC will be labeled using a
              functional, fluorescent ZIP1-GFP hybrid protein constructed in the principal
              investigator's laboratory.  The structure and dynamics of fluorescent SC will
              be examined using optical sections and fluorescent cinema-microscopy. 
              Fluorescent SC will be purified and proteins contained in these structures
              extracted and identified by tandem mass spectroscopy.  Genes corresponding to
              each gene product will be identified and ultimately mutated so their role in SC
              formation, crossover interference and other aspects of meiotic recombination
              and pairing can be tested.
