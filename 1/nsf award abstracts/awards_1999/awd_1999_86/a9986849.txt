Abstract    :
              This project is focused on the preservation, conservation, and improvement of
              the bat collection in the Department of Mammalogy at the American Museum of
              Natural History.  The bat collection at the AMNH exceeds 60,000 specimens, and
              is one of the largest and most important components of the mammal collection. 
              The entire dry collection (skins, skulls, skeletons) is housed in old cabinets,
              specimens are overcrowded in both drawers and cases, and many osteological
              preparations are stored in vials that are too small to safely hold them.  The
              institution has provided a new centralized facility, including a large room and
              adjacent hallway; this support will provide new storage cases, drawers, vials,
              and conservation of the collection.  Verification of bat specimen records in
              the mammalogy collection database, which will take place at the time of
              recuration and movement of the collection, will contribute to database accuracy
              and help provide improved information services to the scientific research
              community.
