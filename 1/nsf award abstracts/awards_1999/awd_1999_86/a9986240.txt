Abstract    :
              

Three studies will be conducted to examine when investigator bias affects
              the accuracy of eyewitness identification and the behavior that affects
              accuracy.  Study One involves a simulation of an eyewitness identification,
              with manipulation of the administrator's knowledge.  Study Two examines verbal
              and non-verbal behaviors that might influence the witness to choose the
              suspect.  The third study considers the witnesses perceptions of potentially
              biasing administrative behavior.  Findings  are expected to be of interest to
              the psychological and legal communities, and to have significant practical
              implications for the design of police lineups, suggesting what safeguards may
              help to ensure effective, accurate, identifications.
