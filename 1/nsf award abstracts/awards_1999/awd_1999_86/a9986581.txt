Abstract    :
              The International Society for Risk Analysis (SRA) plans to hold a series of
              World Congresses on Risk Analysis during the 21st century.  The goal of the
              Congresses will be to foster the creation and communication of integrated and
              interdisciplinary knowledge for risk analysis in developed and developing
              countries.  The theme for the First World Congress is "Risk and Governance,"
              reflecting the worldwide trend toward making better use of risk-oriented
              concepts in public decision making.  SRA's efforts are expected to build on the
              ongoing risk-oriented efforts in various countries as well as the efforts of
              international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation
              and Development, the World Bank, the World Health Organization, and the
              European Commission.

Groundwork for these World Congresses will be
              established at an initial World Symposium on Risk Analysis in June of 2000. 
              The overall objective of the Symposium is to develop an intellectual and
              operational foundation for the subsequent World Congresses.  Leaders in the
              risk analysis field from around the world will be invited by an SRA organizing
              Committee to examine the state of knowledge in various topics.  Symposium
              participants will be responsible for developing: (1) a set of concise written
              statements of the state of the field in various sub-areas; and (2) a directory
              of contacts and organizations around the world who are interested in risk
              analysis and should be approached for interest and participation in the World
              Congresses.

SRA seeks partial financial support from NSF for the World
              Symposium.
