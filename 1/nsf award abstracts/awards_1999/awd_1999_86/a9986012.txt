              Instrumentation: A Specialized Computing Environment for Distributed and
              Virtual Design and Manufacturing.

The University of Maryland will create a
              specialized computing environment for distributed and virtual design and
              manufacturing.  This facility will support research in computer and information
              science sand engineering.  The University of Maryland will purchase two
              graphics workstations, two NT-based servers, and the necessary software for
              developing the facility.  The computing environment will be dedicated to
              several on-going projects on distributed and virtual design and manufacturing. 
              These projects will yield specific contributions in areas related to computing
              and information systems.  With this facility, the investigators can install and
              integrate our approaches, share data across various projects effectively, and
              test our results more thoroughly.  Thus we can study and solve the
              computational challenges that will occur as manufacturers develop advanced,
              information-based product realization processes
