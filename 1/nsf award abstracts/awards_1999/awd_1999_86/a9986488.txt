              Nanostructured Biocomposites for Use as Novel Films and Coatings 


This
              exploratory project investigates the fabrication and applications of
              nanostructured composite films containing both organic and inorganic
              components, specifically films consisting of a silica matrix and containing
              collagen and fibronectin.  The films are synthesized at a liquid-liquid
              interface, and surfactants are used to promote self-assembly and nanostructures
              with useful properties.  

Three applications of the new types of films will
              be tested.  Nanoporous silica-collagen films are expected to have good thermal
              stability and mechanical strength.  They will be tested as protective coatings
              to prevent moisture damage of organic electroluminescent display devices.
              Fibronectin modification of collagen-silica composites will be tested as a
              source of stable molecular sieves, and the pore sizes will be controlled to
              provide membranes that can filter viruses from bioprocess streams.  Also, the
              ability of fibronectin tethers will be exploited in microcarriers for cell
              cultures containing anchorage-dependent cells.  Success in achieving novel
              properties with these unique composites can lead to a wide variety of
              applications.
