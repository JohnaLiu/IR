CIRCADIAN LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY:
              ROLE OF THE MEDIAL PREOPTIC  AREA

Extended recordings of the spontaneous
              running (locomotor) activity of
mammals reveal a robust circadian pattern,
              i.e., during the daily 24-hour
cycle there is a period where the animal is
              very active and a period of
inactivity. This circadian pattern of locomotor
              activity is under the
control of a circadian clock located within the central
              nervous system in
a region known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus  (SCN). The
              timing activity 
of the clock is synchronized by the environmental light-dark
              cycle. 
Destruction of the clock abolishes the circadian rhythm in locomotor
              activity, 
which becomes asynchronous.  It is not known, however,
how the
              clock organizes the spontaneous locomotor activity into a circadian
pattern.
              Dr. Patrickson will determine the role of the medial preoptic
area of the
              hypothalamus in the circadian organization of locomotor activity 
by inducing
              electrolytic lesions within this region. Also, the
role of light-dark cycle on
              the temporal organization of  locomotor activity
will be determined. The
              results from this study will provide an insight in
to the possible mechanisms
              involved in the generation of circadian rhythms.
In addition, the study of
              chronobiology in regards to sleep regulation is 
an enigmatic area of
              neurobiology that clearly merits further investigation.
