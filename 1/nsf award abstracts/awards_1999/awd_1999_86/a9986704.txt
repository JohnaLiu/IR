Abstract    :
              This research project explores the synthesis and properties of sterol-based
              ionophores.  A series of conjugates is proposed which will be used to test
              several hypotheses, including the efficacy of long polyether moieties in thick
              membranes and the possibility of matching the sterol moiety to a particular
              membrane-bound sterol composition.  The long-range goal of this program is to
              generate lead compounds for a new class of antibiotics by rational design.  In
              the undergraduate teaching lab, experiments will be carried out involving the
              characterization of a new class of cross-linked polystyrene resins, which are
              expected to bond bile acids via covalent attachments under physiological
              conditions.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program continues to support the research and teaching activities of Professor
              Steven L. Regen of Lehigh University.  Professor Regen's research efforts
              center on the design of molecules that act in cell membranes in ways that are
              similar to several important antibiotics.  The molecules that are being
              designed will aid in understanding how these antiobiotics work, and may result
              in new antibiotics for clinical use.  In addition, Professor Regen has designed
              an undergraduate organic laboratory curriculum whereby students participate in
              experiments studying a type of cholesterol-binding polymer.
