In this proposal, new approaches towards the
              development of future hybrid bio-electronic devices and systems are proposed.
              The main theme is to use the hybridization and specificity of DNA
              oligonucleotides to result in the assembly of useful silicon devices. Novel
              silicon-in-insulator and selective epitaxial processing techniques will be used
              to fabricate silicon based active (diodes and transistors) devices. These
              devices will then be 'released' from their host substrate into a surrounding
              liquid medium. Single stranded DNA molecules will be attached at specific
              locations on these devices. Meanwhile, a substrate will be prepared with 2-D
              (or 3-D) interconnect layers. These layers will also be functionalized with
              short single stranded oligonucleotides. The free-floating active devices will
              be released onto the patterned/functionalized substrate along with
              oligonucleotides, which will complementarily bind and connect the two molecules
              on the substrate and the device. Using thermal energy, these silicon devices
              will then self-assemble onto the interconnect layers, as dictated by the
              hybridization of the complementary strands of DNA.
