Abstract    :
              Lovelace, Richard
"Disk and Wind Accretion to Magnetized Neutron
              Stars"
AST-9986936

Dr. Lovelace is performing 2- and 3-dimensional
              simulations of disk and wind accretion of material onto rotating magnetized
              stars and  developing  the associated analytic theory.  The models apply to a
              range of astrophysical situations where accretion is occurring, such as binary
              star systems where there are inclined rotating stars, magnetized neutron stars,
              fast stellar winds.  In addition, the effects of direct accretion, magnetic
              inhibition of accretion, viscosity, and the so-called 'propeller mechanism' are
              incorporated into the models and compared to observations.  This project
              involves a strong collaboration with colleagues in Russia, via co-PI
              Romanova.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Stellar
              Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA) and the NSF International Program for the
              Baltic States, Bulgaria, Poland, & Independent States of the Former Soviet
              Union (INT).
