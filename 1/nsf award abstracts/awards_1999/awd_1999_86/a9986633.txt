Abstract    :
              Water constitutes 60% of human body weight, and control of normal ion and water
              balance by the cardiovascular-renal system is extremely important for our
              health.  An excess of body salt and water causes edema and hypertension,
              whereas fluid loss evokes cardiovascular malfunction, leading to hypertension
              and shock.  Using a unique bird model, Dr. Nishimura will determine biochemical
              and molecular properties of the water channel in the kidney and examine how the
              kidney conserves or excretes water through this gate to maintain body fluid
              balance.  She intends to 1) clone aquaporin, a water channel protein, using
              molecular techniques; 2) study its cellular localization and function using a
              Xenopus oocyte expression system; and 3) examine its control by hormones.  Only
              avian and mammalian kidneys can concentrate urine, and bird kidneys possess
              both primitive and more advanced anatomical/functional features; thus, the bird
              model is useful for answering fundamental questions about the mechanisms of
              water balance.  Such studies will elucidate the phylogenetic modulation of
              water channels during adaptation of animals from aquatic to terrestrial
              environments and help us understand the mechanisms working in humans in health
              and disease.
