Abstract    :
              This award will support  a study using tree rings to monitor past variations in
              large-scale atmospheric circulation features such as El Nino/Southern
              Oscillation (ENSO).  The study will use classic dendrochronological methods to
              exactly date annual tree-ring time series, and then will use modern numerical
              methods for data-quality control, chronology computations, and paleoclimate
              reconstructions.  The project will sample trees to fill data gaps in the
              ENSO-sensitive areas of Mexico and the southwestern United States, and will
              develop climatically sensitive tree ring chronologies in ENSO-teleconnected
              areas in Florida and southern Africa.  It will also explore the
              dendroclimatological potential of indigenous tree species in Costa Rica.
