Abstract    :
              This project, which is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program
              focusses on increasing the understanding of detailed molecular dynamics of
              chemical reactions that occur on solid surfaces.  This project, conducted by
              Dr. Andrew Bocarsly and his group at Princeton University is composed of four
              interrelated sub-projects.  The first sub-project examines the internal state
              distribution of the product of platinum catalyzed oxidization  reactions. 
              Sub-project 2 uses scanning tunneling microscopy in conjunction with ab initio
              calculations to explore the detailed dynamics of the dissociation of CO on the
              Fe(100) surface.  In the third sub-project, the effect of internal energy on
              the probability of dissociative chemisorption of methane on the Pt(111) surface
              is probed. The final sub-project examines the interaction of polyatomic organic
              ions with hydrocarbon covered surfaces in order to obtain mechanistic
              information about the ion-surface reactions that occur.  

The research in
              this proposal will result in a deeper understanding of elementary chemical
              processes that occur on solid surfaces.  Such information will improve our
              knowledge of a number of  important technological processes such as
              heterogeneous catalysis and the manufacture of electronic devices.
