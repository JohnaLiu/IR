	The long-term goal of this research project is to gain
              understanding of how oligodendrocytes (and Schwann cells) myelinate axons. 
              Realizing that none of the proteins involved in the early recognition and
              assembly stages of myelination were unknown, a strategy was developed to
              identify such proteins through isolation of complementary DNA molecules that
              represent messenger RNAs located at sites where myelin sheaths assemble. 
              Studies of the developmental expression patterns of some of these mRNAs (over
              80 were identified) showed that they fell into two developmental groups.  One
              group was not strongly expressed until myelination was well under way
              (postnatal day 10 in rat).  A second group, nearly equal in number to the first
              group, was expressed earlier and had higher expression in tissues with smaller
              myelinated fibers.  With techniques used to identify these mRNAs, studies will
              be conducted to identify a third group of mRNAs, those expressed preferentially
              at times that oligodendrocyte processes first contact the axons they will
              myelinate.  Once these mRNAs are identified, studies will be conducted to
              locate the sites where mRNAs and proteins are expressed in the developing
              nervous system to insure that the proteins are indeed important for early
              stages of myelination. 
	The myelinated nervous system evolved in a common
              ancestor of all jawed vertebrates, including cartilaginous and teleost fishes,
              amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.  This development required recruitment
              of proteins that allowed myelination to take place in the common ancestor. 
              Comparative studies between rats and sharks are planned and will be used to
              help us understand how the myelinated nervous system originated.
