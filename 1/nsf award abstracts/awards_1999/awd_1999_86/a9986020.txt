              Research

The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue
              University will acquire four Sun Ultra Enterprise 450 quad-processor servers
              plus Myrinet interconnections for research in computer and information science
              and engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research projects,
              including in particular:
  
 Speculative Distributed Shared Memory


              Latency-Reducing Compiler Techniques for Distributed Shared Memory,

 Studies
              of large-scale Applications for Symmetric Multiprocessor Clusters


              Multiplex:  Future Billion-Transistor Microarchitectures

The new equipment
              will provide a testbed platform for fine-grain software distributed shared
              memory (DSM) to implement and evaluate speculative coherent DSM architectures
              and serve as a target for a compiler.  In addition, the cluster and individual
              servers will also be used in single-user mode to perform unperturbed
              measurements of our large-scale applications and will allow single-user access
              to individual SMPs without inhibiting long-running multi-user
              applications.

The servers will provide the required memory and processing
              power as well as memory bandwidth to perform the memory-and computer-intensive
              simulations of the Multiplex architecture. The new equipment will deliver high
              simulation throughput rates by running many simulations concurrently. 

The
              cluster and individual servers will provide the high memory bandwidth, large
              aggregate memory and processing power required to run detailed, large-scale
              parallel simulations for the speculative DSM research .
