Abstract    :
              This project will focus on statistical testing of a function's curvature in
              common econometric models. The research will provide practitioners with a
              simple method for testing linearity, concavity, and/or convexity in situations
              where the shape of the relationship between variables may have important
              consequences for the empirical results. The test statistics, which are based on
              a simple idea related to pair-wise slopes in the data, do not require
              parametric specification (or estimation) of the function of interest. Unlike
              many nonparametric methods, the test statistics do not require the choice of
              bandwidths or other smoothing parameters. The tests can be applied in a variety
              of econometric models of interest, including the nonparametric regression
              model, the semilinear regression model, the single-index model, and
              fixed-effects models. Throughout the course of the project, computer routines
              will be clearly written and documented so that they may be made publicly
              available to researchers.
