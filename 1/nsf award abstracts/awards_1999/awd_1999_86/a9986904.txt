Abstract    :
              George H. Jones

This conference will explore the reasons for current levels
              of participation and levels of success of African American and other minority
              scientists in obtaining research funding from the National Science Foundation
              Directorate for Biological Sciences.  Beginning as well as established
              investigators will participate and will be asked to discuss questions such as: 
              What institutional support is or could be provided to grant applicants to
              enhance their success?  What more can the National Science Foundation
              Directorate for Biological Sciences do to increase the numbers of applications
              from members of under-represented groups and to facilitate their full
              participation?
