              ABSTRACT

OCE-9986727

Although the fields of organic geochemistry and
              biogeochemistry have advanced significantly through studies of stable isotope
              distributions and exchange, the isotopes of hydrogen have not received a level
              of research attention commensurate with the abundance of hydrogen in organic
              compounds.  In this project, the principal investigator will develop
              instrumentation and new research techniques to study processes affecting the
              distribution of hydrogen isotopes in natural organic molecules.  By study of
              compound-specific distributions of common hydrogen and deuterium, he expects to
              disentangle the processes responsible for isotopic fractionation during
              decomposition and to follow initial plant lipids through decomposition and
              accumulation in marine sediments and food chains.  A variety of source plants
              would be included in the study.
