Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to determine whether the aero-sol-gel (ASG)
              process can be used to produce nano-structured, mixed-oxide powders for
              catalysis applications.  This exploratory project is aimed at demonstrating use
              of ASG mixed oxides as epoxidation catalysts in simple, liquid-state reactions
              of olefins.  Amorphous titania-silica and vanadium oxide-silica catalysts will
              be synthesized; similar catalysts have already been produced by a solution
              sol-gel process.  With aerosols, two normally immiscible chemical components
              can be forced into the confinement of a droplet by co-condensation of vapor
              streams, and processing under ambient conditions is feasible.  Manipulation of
              primary particle size, specific surface area, bulk density, and aggregate size
              as well as composition is anticipated.  Mixed oxides will be characterized in
              terms of titania content through mass spectroscopy.  Catalysts will be
              characterized by infrared analysis to estimate the presence of
              titanium-oxygen-silicon bonding.  Kinetic studies will be based on the
              well-characterized epoxidation of octene.  Informal collaboration with Goodyear
              Chemical is planned.  If successful, this work could lead to a new method for
              producing solid catalysts by an inexpensive route.
