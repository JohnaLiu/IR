Abstract    :
              This project entitled "Fluorocarbon and Peptide Film Growth from Polyatomic Ion
              Beams" is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.   The
              work, by the research group headed by Dr. Luke Hanley at the University of
              Illinois - Chicago, will examine the use of covalently bound, polyatomic ion
              beams, of the size 4-100 atoms, for the growth of smooth and nanotextured thin
              films.  The ion beams permit the controlled transfer of chemical functionality
              to a surface.  There are two related studies included in the project.  (1)
              Studies will be performed on the growth of fluorocarbon (FC) films on polymers
              and silicon surfaces.  Second, peptide ion beams will be used to grow
              biomolecular thin films on polymers.    AFM and XPS will be used to
              characterize the films.  Both studies seek to determine how polyatomic ions
              affect film growth on individual particle surfaces with an emphasis on
              understanding film growth from plasmas.

This research is of relatively high
              risk but will have a significant impact on the fundamental understanding of
              surface chemistry.  In particular, it will provide details of the mechanisms of
              the interactions of ions with surfaces.  The ion beams will be both mass and
              energy selected.  Fluorocarbon films can have protective, protein resistant,
              gas permeable and/or optical properties which have application in the areas of
              biomaterials, optics, sensors and electronics.  The results of this research
              will be of interest to industry, national labs and academics working in the
              area of surface science.
