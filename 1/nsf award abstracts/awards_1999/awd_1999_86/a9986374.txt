Abstract    :
              The detailed mechanism of the interaction of state-selected ions with solid
              surfaces is the focus of this research project supported by the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program.  Professor Dennis  Jacobs and his colleagues at the
              University of Notre Dame use state-selected scattering of ion beams from well
              characterized surfaces, coupled with state-specific detection of the scattered
              ion products, to determine the microscopic mechanisms of ion-surface
              interactions.  Mechanisms of charge transfer, ion fragmentation, and atom
              abstraction during the surface collision are addressed.  The dissociative
              neutralization of hydrogen molecule ion colliding with Al(111), the
              interactions of HBr+ with the Si(100) surface, and alkali-atom abstraction in
              the collision of NH3+ with alkali dosed metal surfaces are the specific systems
              chosen for study.  Information from these studies is useful in understanding
              reactive ion etching, atmospheric ion chemistry, and spacecraft dynamics.

In
              order to develop a complete understanding of the interaction of ions with
              surfaces, detailed state specific dynamic information is needed.  This research
              project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on
              obtaining this sort of information.  The fundamental research carried out in
              Professor Jacobs' laboratory at Notre Dame, addresses the microscopic
              mechanisms of charge exchange, fragmentation, and atom abstraction when ions
              collide with surfaces.  This information is useful in applications ranging from
              semiconductor processing to sattelite dynamics.
