Abstract    :
              Smith, Horace
"RR Lyrae Stars & the Oosterhoff Dichotomy"
AST-9986943

Dr.
              Smith proposes to investigate the reasons why two groups of RR Lyrae stars
              exist among globular clusters (the so-called "Oosterhoff Dichotomy").  Such
              stars are the primary distance standard for Population II stars and clusters. 
              The proposed work will therefore contribute directly to elucidating the nature
              of the accelerating universe.  A photometric and spectroscopic program will be
              undertaken in order to determine the physical parameters such as metallicity
              that are suspected to correlate with Oosterhoff's group membership.  In
              addition to this main focus, Dr. Smith will also examine the modulation of the
              shape and amplitude of RR Lyrae light curves (Blazhko effect).
