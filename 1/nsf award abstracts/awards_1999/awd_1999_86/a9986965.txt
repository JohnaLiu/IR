              ABSTRACT

Branch, David
"Direct Analysis of Supernova
              Spectra"
AST-9986965

Dr. Branch is using a suite of efficient,
              parameterized spectrum-synthesis codes to extract information from the observed
              spectra of supernovae.  The immediate goal is to determine the composition,
              density and velocity structure of supernovae ejecta and the associated
              circumstellar material.  This information will be incorporated into a
              web-accessible database on supernovae.  The results provide constraints on
              nuclear-hydrodynamic models of supernova explosions, and help to provide
              physically self-consistent, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium calculations of
              the emergent spectra of the models.  Dr. Branch is also carrying out several
              related studies:  (1) Monte Carlo studies of the effects of extinction by
              interstellar dust on the observed brightness and color of supernovae and of
              gamma-ray bursts; (2) Monte Carlo simulations of the distribution on the sky of
              gamma rays from radioactive 26Al; and  (3) the determination of the luminosity
              distributions of supernovae.
