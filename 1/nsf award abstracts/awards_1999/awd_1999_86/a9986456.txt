Abstract    :
              Investigations of heat and mass transport, and of the range of thermal and
              chemical environments present at seafloor vent sites, require that extimates be
              made of transport properties, including permeability, porosity, and porosity
              structure.  The goal of this research is to constrain the transport properties
              of deposits from this environment using samples recovered from the Mothra
              hydrothermal field on the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, and
              samples recovered from severa other vent sites.  Permeability, porosity, and
              thermal conductivity will e determined on these samples in the Laboratory.
