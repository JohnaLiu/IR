The project collects data on decisions made by
              top college and university administrators over the last 35 years and the
              priorities of current top administrators on academic curricula and programs.  
              Data will be collected from three top officials (presidents, provosts, and
              directors of institutional research) at each of 345 institutions.  The
              institutions will be selected through a stratified random sampling procedure in
              which chances of selection are higher for the higher-ranking institutions. 
              This new data will be combined with selected variables drawn from 21 existing
              data sets to form an institutional data archive.  For a majority of the
              enrollment and financial variables, time series data will be included at
              five-year intervals beginning in 1967-68.  Most curricular and programmatic
              variables will also be collected at more than one point in time.  These time
              series will open the way for quantitative studies of institutional change over
              a 30-year period.

These data will be used to investigate five issues.  Three
              of these questions concern important systemwide changes that occurred during
              the period.  What are the extent and forms: (1) of movement toward professional
              programs and away from traditional liberal arts and sciences; (2) of movement
              toward interdisciplinary programs; (3) of increasing managerial influence over
              educational policies and priorities?  The data will also to be used to provide
              a clearer understanding of the structure of the higher education system,
              including (4) the effects of structural location on the curricular and
              budgetary behavior of institutions; and (5) the sources of competitive
              advantage and disadvantage during period.

 The data set will be disseminated
              via CD-ROMs and made available to researchers and policy makers through the
              University of Michigan's Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social
              Research.  The data has the potential to serve as the basis for ongoing
              research on the changing structure of the American higher education system.
