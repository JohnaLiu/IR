Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a group at the University of California Los
              Angeles to work on (a) the CMS experiment currently being built for running at
              the CERN Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, and (b) the HERA-B experiment
              currently taking data at the DESY Laboratory in Hamburg, Germany.
	The CMS
              experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)  will investigate
              proton-proton interactions at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV.  The physics
              program includes probing for quark and lepton substructure and new heavy gauge
              bosons, electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of mass, properties of
              top-quark production and decay, CP-violation and other rare phenomena in
              B-meson decay and the search for supersymmetric particles and other phenomena
              beyond the Standard Model.  The UCLA group will focus its efforts on the
              "higher-level" trigger and data acquisition (DAQ) areas.  In addition, they
              will prepare for the CMS low-intensity B-physics running which will be a major
              component in early LHC running and will later be important for b-jet tagging of
              more exotic states.
	The objective of the HERA-B experiment is the discovery
              and study of CP-violation and other topics in B-meson decay.  HERA-B is a
              "fixed-target" experiment in the forward direction at the HERA proton storage
              ring that uses wire targets in the halo of the stored beam and a silicon
              microvertex detector inside the vacuum pipe.  The primary goal is measurement
              of the CP-violation parameter, sin(2b), for the decay Bd  J/Y KS comparable to
              that of an electron-positron "b-factory".  They expect to measure 400 such
              events by the summer of 2000.
