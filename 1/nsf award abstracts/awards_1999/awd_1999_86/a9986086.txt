ABSTRACT

This award is for the partial support of a conference
              in the field of Partial Differential Equations. The conference will address
              problems in the areas of: Dispersive Equations, Free Boundary Value Problems,
              Fully Nonlinear Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, Geometric Partial
              Differential Equations and their connections with Harmonic Analysis. All these
              areas are currently in the stage of significant development motivated by new
              ideas and new applications. The conference will be held right before the
              special session of the AMS, allowing the organizers to attract leading
              researchers in the field and many young investigators. The conference will
              definitely have a significant impact on the development of the field and will
              be beneficial to the mathematical community. I strongly recommend the award.
