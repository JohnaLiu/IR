The design and construction of a sensitive high-speed
              infrared photon-counting photometer for astronomy is proposed.  The sensor is
              an edge-illuminated solid-state photomultiplier (EISSPM) detector.

This
              instrument system will enable new studies not possible with prevous detectors. 
              These include:  pulsar emission mechanisms., searches for yung pulsars in the
              galactic plane and a variety of a periodic high-speed variability of
              astrophysical sources.

The instrument system will satisfy these
              requirements:  sub-microsecond time response to as high as 1 Mega hz,
              broad-band sensitivity of 1 to 5 microns, high quantum efficiency (40%), and
              photon counting performance.  This instrument package will interface with
              several existing telescopes to produce high quality, important scientific data.
