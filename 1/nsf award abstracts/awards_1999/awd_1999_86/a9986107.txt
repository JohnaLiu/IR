Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              a 'Self-Sensing Active Control Foil Bearing' (SSACFB).  Through the use of a
              stack of piezoelectric ceramic elements attached at the lower side of foil
              elements, the load on the foil element can be determined from the voltage
              generated by the piezoelectric elements.  At the same time, the piezoelectric
              stack also acts as an actuator to push/pull the foil element from the shaft to
              increase the loading capacity of the bearing and/or to ensure lift-off at low
              shaft rotational speeds.  The novelty of the concept is in elimination of the
              sensing system, the integration of sensing and control in a single unit, and
              the active control of the bearing to provide long-life, lower power loss, and
              larger loading capacity.  In addition, elastic bed and diamond-like coatings on
              the foil element will be addressed in this proposal.  Phase I found the
              self-sensing and controllability in this bearing to be feasible.  Construction
              and testing of a fully instrumented, prototype self-sensing controllable foil
              bearing will be performed in Phase II.

Potential commercial applications are
              planned in the $1.5 billion bearing market, which is growing presently at about
              11% annually with moderate growth forecasted in the future.  The SSACFB
              technology is aimed at commercial needs for oilless high-speed controllable
              bearings.  Successful development of SSACFB will impact high speed bearing
              applications, especially in the aerospace/aeronautic and other high speed
              precision manufacturing industries.
