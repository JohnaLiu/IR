Abstract    :
              The initial objective of this research project is to develop methods to deposit
              single protein molecules on Si(100) surfaces at specific sites.  Two approaches
              will be tested as part of this feasibility study.  First, a biopolymer stamping
              method will be tested in which non-volatile, high molecular weight molecules
              are positioned onto silicon substrates in ultrahigh vacuum.  The second
              approach will involve incubating a protein solution with a surface that has
              been nanopattemed with one or more affinity ligands.  When combined with
              feedback-controlled lithography, both methods have the potential to deliver
              single biopolymers to an exact location.  Electronic characterization of
              individual Heme proteins bound to the silicon surface will be performed by
              newly developed dI/dV mapping in conjunction with scanning tunneling
              microscopy.
