Abstract

The objective of
              this project is to determine the feasibility of using two-dimensional DNA
              crystals as a scaffolding for the self-assembly of linear arrays of metallic
              nanoparticles.  Gold-modified oligonucleotides will be patterned into 2D DNA
              crystals using the base sequence design procedure previously demonstrated in
              our team.  Nanoparticles with 1.4 nm diameter Au cores will be covalently
              attached to hairpin oligonucleotides, which are then assembled into the DNA
              crystal.  A variety of conjugation chemistries will be examined to covalently
              attach gold nanoparticles with high attachment yield.  The reaction schemes
              will result in a variety of tether lengths between the Au and the DNA, and the
              impact of this length on the spatial arrangement of the nanoparticles within
              the array will be investigated as well.  The goal is to minimize unwanted
              interactions between the Au particles and the DNA while optimizing precision of
              particle spatial orientation.  The 2D DNA crystals will be examined by scanning
              probe microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to investigate basic
              scientific issues concerning 1) interaction between the nanogold and DNA, 2)
              distortion of the 2D DNA crystal due to nanogold, 3) yield of the particle
              arrays, and 4) precision of the alignment.

If successful, the capability to
              pattern nanometer scale Au particles with nanoscale precision in two dimensions
              by using DNA crystals in this way would provide an enabling technology for
              single electron circuitry, which could extend electronics far beyond the limits
              of conventional technology.  This approach could also open up possibilities for
              other types of nanoelectronic circuitry based on the precise assembly of
              molecules and other nanoscale objects.
