The Internet provides a new
              domain of human experience.  Estimates of
the growth rate of penetration of
              the Internet among the population
shows that its use is growing faster than
              previous innovations
(telephones, radio, and television) that have already
              become nearly
universal in industrialized nations.  The majority of the
              U.S.
population will soon be using the Internet for communication,
              commercial
transactions, and entertainment. The Internet also provides an
              exciting
new medium for the conduct of behavioral research.  By means of
              Internet
research, it is now possible to accomplish in a few weeks what used
              to
require six months or a year.  Because the World Wide Web makes
available
              an extremely heterogeneous, international sample, it becomes
possible to
              examine the generality of laboratory research to demographic
groups that have
              rarely been studied in previous research.  This allows
one to investigate if
              conclusions from laboratory research are unique to
college sophomores tested
              in university labs or if they have external
validity to a larger population
              tested under more naturalistic
conditions.
	Are the cognitive processes used
              by the general population on the
Internet the same as those used by students
              in university laboratories? 
There are two aspects to this question that need
              to be distinguished. 
The first is that the people tested are different, so
              any difference in
results may be due to differences in education, age, wealth,
              or other
demographic differences among the groups tested.  The second aspect
              is
that the Internet medium itself may itself induce different modes
              of
thought, reasoning, judgment, and decision-making.  This research
explore
              these questions.
This is a proposal to continue and expand an on-going program
              of
research on the Internet.  In addition to experiments on judgment
              and
decision-making on the Internet with 6,000 participants, I propose
to
              conduct surveys of behavioral scientists about the Internet and to
create
              tools that will make it easier for students and newcomers to
Internet research
              to adapt their studies to this new medium. By
comparing lab and Web studies,
              the validity of both procedures can be
tested.  By comparing the results for
              different demographic groups, it
is possible to examine the linkage between
              such characteristics and
research findings. If behavioral research conducted
              via the Internet
lives up to its potential, then the process of facilitating
              the transfer
of such research to the Internet can result in acceleration of
              the
scientific enterprise.
