Abstract    :
              The proposed research will focus on the timing and terms of the agreement in
              corporate bankruptcy reorganizations of large, publicly held firms under
              Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The analysis will consist of two parts.
              In the first part, the process of corporate bankruptcy reorganizations will be
              modeled as a multilateral model sequential bargaining. In the second part, the
              bargaining model will be estimated using U.S. data. The estimates will be used
              to conduct policy experiments. For example, the effects of a variety of
              institutional features of U.S. Bankruptcy Code on the outcome of Chapter 11
              bankruptcies will be evaluated. The funds requested in this proposal will be
              used to collect data that are necessary to carry out the empirical analysis.
