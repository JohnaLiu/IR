Abstract    :
              This project will develop a formal model-based approach to the indirect
              estimation of migration that combines information from several geographical
              areas, time periods, and data sources to produce estimates of a certain
              variable on the basis of data that might be indirectly related to its value or
              that may be out of date.  To do so this project will draw on work carried out
              in four areas: indirect estimation methods in demography, spatial interaction
              modeling in geography, model-based approaches to the analysis of missing data
              in statistics, and the mathematical representation of regularities in the age
              profiles of migration rates.  It then will apply its particular formal
              model-based synthesis of these contributions to indirectly estimate the
              interregional migration flow data reported by the past four U.S. decennial
              censuses, and it will assess its approach to indirect estimation by considering
              the adequacy with which that approach "predicts" the past observed flows using
              only very limited data.

Although indirect estimation techniques have been
              applied fruitfully in studies of mortality and fertility, they have not been
              developed as systematically and formally for the analysis of migration flows. 
              Yet, with the future elimination of the "long form" questionnaire from the
              decennial censuses and its replacement by a much smaller continuous monthly
              sampling survey, students of territorial mobility often will find it necessary
              to deal with inadequate, missing, or possibly inaccurate sample data on
              migration by adopting such methods of estimation. This project will address
              that problem and will provide a formal methodology for carrying out such
              estimation efforts.
