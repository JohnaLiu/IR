Dr. Robert Byer of Leland Stanford
              University will investigate the suitability of using silicon micro circuit
              technology (developed for the LIGO project) for adaptive optics (A/O) actuators
              for white-light, diffraction-limited image formation across a wide field of
              view at a large ground-based astronomical telescope.

Details of the
              engineering construction of the A/O will be examined such as membrane
              thickness, actuator spacing, electrostatic pad size.  A new tpe of driver
              circuit which would eliminate the need for many high voltage operational
              amplifiers will be introduced to reduce cost and simplify the mirror
              device.
