              Instrumentation: A Multidisciplinary Design Testbed of Research and
              Education

The design problems of the next century will require mixing
              diverse disciplines and computational tools in order to deliver new information
              services and physical products.  The Department of Mathematics and Computer
              Science at Drexel University will address these challenges by building a design
              testbed that connects facilities and researchers engaged in diverse but
              complementary research projects; most importantly: (1) collaborative
              engineering design (2) intelligent mobile robot design (3) software design
              recovery (4) design of symbolic and scientific Problem Solving Environments. 
              This testbed for education and research on multi-disciplinary design problems
              will consist of a gigabit network backbone (1 gigabit switch, gigabit Ethernet
              cards), shared computing resources (1 Sun compute server, 1 Sun disk server, 1
              Sag Electronics RAID, 5 SGI workstations, 2 Dell workstations) and mobile robot
              experimentation materials (8 Lego kits, 1 Nomad Super Scout II).
