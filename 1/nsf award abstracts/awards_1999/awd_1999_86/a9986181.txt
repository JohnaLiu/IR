Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis of conformationally biased peptide
              models.  Substituted aminocaproic acid (Aca) linkers containing a variety of
              substitution patterns and useful for the formation of beta-turns will be
              prepared.  A series of gamma-turn mimetics will also be prepared and
              conformational properties of the compounds will be studied using NMR, IR, CD
              and X-ray crystallography.  Also, solid-state synthetic methods will be
              developed for the preparation of small turn libraries.  The work will provide
              synthetic chemists with the tools needed to perform systematic manipulation of
              local peptide structure.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Jeffrey Aube of the
              Department of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Kansas.   Professor Aube
              will focus his work on the synthesis of substituted aminocaproic acid linkers
              and related molecules with the goal of containing peptides into particular
              conformations.   The properties of the resulting peptidomimetics can mimic
              those of biologically important peptides and thus could have impact in the
              pharmaceutical industry.
