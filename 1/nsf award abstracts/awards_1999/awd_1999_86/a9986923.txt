Abstract    :
               Through the NSF Computer Science, Engineering and Math Scholarship program
              Mercy College is providing, each year, 15 talented, economically disadvantaged
              Computer Science majors, with the opportunity to pursue full time study towards
              their degree program.  Mercy College is a Hispanic Serving Institution with a
              student body consisting of mainly first-generation college students, who are
              heads-of-households, often economically disadvantaged and juggling occupations
              with the pursuit of higher education.  Through this program Mercy College is
              providing talented, economically disadvantaged students with scholarship
              support enabling them to lessen dependence on work to complete degree programs
              in computer science.  The project is also achieving a secondary goal of
              increasing the number of students, underrepresented in computer science, that
              complete degree programs in this area and pursue graduate education in this
              field.
