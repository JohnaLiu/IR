The project is designed to address two pressing needs of
              professional development in elementary science education.  First teachers need
              better preparation in science; second they need preparation in understanding
              students' scientific thinking.  Both are essential in meeting the objectives in
              recent state and national standards for science education, especially those of
              promoting student inquiry.

The proposal is to develop a volume of written
              and video case studies as materials to be used to promote teachers' substantive
              investigation of student inquiry in science.  This development will take place
              in collaboration with a group of 24 elementary school teachers whom the PIs
              will recruit directly from local schools.  The PIs will work with these
              teachers over three years in month-long summer institutes and in two-hour,
              bi-weekly meetings during the school years.   The meetings will integrate
              teacher study of physics with their study of students' reasoning in physics. 
              The summer institutes will include adaptations of existing introductory courses
              in the areas of force and motion and electricity and magnetism.

The final
              project will be a collection of case studies selected from what the teachers
              produce and organized to illustrate a progression of sophistication in student
              inquiry.  The expectation is that the materials will be useful for preservice
              teachers as well as for experienced inservice teachers, including those
              developing applications for NBPTS certification.
