This proposal seeks to exploit the vast effort in protein
              crystal growth technology in the formation of mesoporous films.  The use of
              these bio-crystals in x-ray crystallography requires essentially perfectly
              ordered samples, with long-range periodicity extending up to ~1 millimeter. 
              Protein crystallographers have been successful in growing these samples for
              more than 1000 different proteins.  Once grown, such crystals can be used as
              templates for a range of different materials, by adapting the templating
              techniques which have been demonstrated in colloidal crystals or surfactants. 
              This will lead to the formation of nearly ideal ordered mesoporous materials,
              in a planar format suitable for optical applications.  These materials will be
              excellent candidates for x-ray photonic band gap systems.
