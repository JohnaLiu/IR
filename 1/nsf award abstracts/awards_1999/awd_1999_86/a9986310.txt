Abstract    :
              9986310

This project will extend the work of quality control and basic
              analysis 
of radiocarbon data collected as part of the WOCE program, presently
              
being performed for data from the Pacific, to the Indian and Atlantic
              
Oceans.  The intent is to provide a usable database of global 
radiocarbon
              distribution to the general ocean science community and to 
begin to apply
              this in an attempt to address a variety of physical 
questions associated with
              ventilation, mixing and transport in the ocean, 
particularly in the deep
              ocean.
