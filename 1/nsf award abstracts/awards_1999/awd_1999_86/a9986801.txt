This is a comparative study of aging in natural populations
              of guppies based on individually mark as many as 2,000 guppies each from two
              populations.  One population is from an environment where they naturally
              experience low mortality rates, so that they have high life expectancies.  The
              other population was recently introduced from a high mortality rate environment
              to a low mortality rate environment, where differences in mortality rate are
              caused by differences in the predators that guppies co-occur with.  This second
              population has already evolved to some extent in response to the lower
              mortality rates in the new environment.  A recently developed statistical test
              will determine if there is an acceleration in mortality rates in the oldest age
              classes of guppies and hence if there are differences among these two
              populations in the rate of acceleration of mortality rate, i.e., senescence. 
              Theory predicts that there should be differences in the rate of senescence in
              these two populations.
	
The broader goal is to determine why animals age
              from an evolutionary perspective.  While hundreds of investigators are studying
              aging, very few are considering why we see differences among populations or
              species in the rate of aging, even though a theory predicting why such
              differences evolve was proposed over 40 years ago.  This study tests these
              predictions.
