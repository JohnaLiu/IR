"Project Inquiry" will improve the science literacy of all
              elementary students' grades 3-8 in Berkeley County School District (BCSD) and
              Charleston County School District (CCSD) in the low country of South Carolina.
              This five year, Local Systemic Change (LSC) project will provide all teachers
              (640 BCSD and 728 CCSD) grades 3-8, with at least 135 hours of professional
              development.  The school district will support professional development for
              grades K-2 teachers by using Eisenhower, state and local funds. Inquiry-based
              curriculum materials,  (Full  Option Science System and Science and Technology
              for Children),  teaching strategies, and assessment will promote content
              knowledge that is consistent with the SC Science Frameworks and the National
              Science Education Standards and will move both districts significantly closer
              to full implementation of standards-based science teaching.  Materials Resource
              Centers already established in both districts will provide a systematic way to
              distribute hands-on science materials to all classrooms.  Faculty from higher
              education institutions such as the Medical University of South Carolina, the
              College of Charleston, The Citadel Charleston Southern University and Trident
              Technical College will play a role in supporting the professional development
              activities and serving on a Steering Committee.  Business partners such as
              Bayer, DuPont, Santee Cooper and BP/Amoco will also provide expertise in
              science.
