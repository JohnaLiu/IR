Abstract    :
              (99), (21), (31), (59) The university is spearheading an endowment campaign
              entitled 'Students First' with a goal of raising $10 million for scholarship
              support.  As part of this campaign, the College of Natural Sciences is using
              funds from the National Science Foundation to fund forty scholarships per year
              for the next two years. These scholarships are being awarded to juniors and
              seniors majoring in mathematics, computer science and industrial technology who
              plan to graduate within two years. 

The College of Natural Sciences strives
              to recruit and retain academically talented, low-income students by offering
              student support services as well as financial assistance. Forty National
              Science Foundation scholarships of $2,500  are available to students each year
              for two years. In addition, money is used to strengthen the infrastructure of
              the university in order to offer further support to scholarship
              recipients.

An application process for selecting scholarship recipients is
              based on academic achievement, financial need, full time status as a student,
              and date of expected graduation. Student progress is evaluated based on a
              system that is already in place at the university.  Measurable outcomes relate
              to student proficiency, grade point average, retention, and career placement
              upon graduation.
