Churchwell, Edward
"Massive Star Formation: Problems Ripe for
              Progress"
AST-9986548

An investigation of several key problems in massive
              star formation is proposed.  The earliest stages of star formation are obscured
              and it is therefore difficult to observationally constrain theories for the
              process.  The PI will use the methyl cyanide line emission as a probe to
              determine the physical state of circumstellar gas.  Molecular and far infrared
              observations will be used to construct and constrain models for the spectral
              energy distributions for each region of massive star formation.  In addition,
              attempts will be made to detect and image the distribution of shocked gas very
              near the massive forming stars.  The purpose of this part of the project is to
              empirically test the two competing notions of how massive stars in clusters
              form, i.e. by accretion or by stellar mergers.
Funding for this project was
              provided by the NSF program for Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
