The power of educational technologies is brought into science
              education for grades 5-8 by creating science materials that use easily
              implemented electronic technology.  The project is structured to increase our
              understanding of how teachers at the middle school level can incorporate
              electronic technology and whether their students learn mathematics and science
              concepts more effectively through the use of the technology.  The materials
              address two important science standards at the middle school level:  force and
              motion, and transfer of energy.  The units are constructed to enhance or
              replace modules in other curricula.  They support data collection and analysis,
              integration of mathematics, understanding changes and modeling.  Measurements
              are made using inexpensive, but sensitive, probeware connected to handheld
              computers.  The Pedagogica software adds scaffolding, guided inquiry and
              student assessment to the probeware.  Student learning of complex relationships
              can be facilitated by the use of probeware.  Models and simulations allow
              students to explore behavior that is difficult to understand by traditional
              means.  Teacher support materials encourage teachers change practice for a few
              weeks.
