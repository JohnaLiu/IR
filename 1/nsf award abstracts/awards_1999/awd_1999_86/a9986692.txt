Abstract    :
              Discharge plasmas at or near atmospheric pressures provide a fertile environment
              for the experimental study of collisions and radiative processes dominated by
              step-wise processes and by three-body collisions.  Two approaches have been
              developed for the generation and maintenance of stable atmospheric-pressure
              discharge plasmas.  One utilizes a hollow cathode discharge concept; the second
              is based on a modified dielectric barrier discharge.  These two devices will be
              used to carry out a comprehensive series of cw and time-resolved optical
              measurements aimed at elucidating the fundamental collisional and radiative
              processes in plasmas composed of pure neon and in neon/hydrogen, neon/nitrogen,
              and neon/oxygen mixtures.
