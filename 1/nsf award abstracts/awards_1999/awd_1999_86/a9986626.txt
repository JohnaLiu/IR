One of the frontiers of materials science is the ability to
              organize materials into two or three dimensional functional structures on a
              nanometer to micrometer length scale.  Lithographic approaches to the
              arrangement of such structures was the basis for technological advancement in
              the past two decades.  New developments which utilize methods such as self
              assembly, surface modification, printing, transfer, and etching on the
              molecular to nanoscale level have introduced a number or innovative approaches
              to the systematic formation of periodic structures that go beyond traditional
              lithographic methods.  The tools of interest for building and directing the
              construction of such structures include physical, chemical, biochemical,
              intermolecular, ionic and surface interactions.  The objective of this
              symposium is to explore the many approaches to the production of patterned or
              periodic structures in two and three dimensions that are under investigation in
              industrial and academic laboratories.  A focus will be place on new and unique
              methods, which may utilize a range of materials and processing techniques. 
              Final applications for these approaches range from electro-optics and photonics
              to biosensors or MEMS technology.

This conference will offer opportunity for
              young investigators and graduate students to present their work, and develop
              contacts which might prove critical in their professional lives.  Funding will
              be particularly targeted toward such young investigators, including those
              amongst the invited speakers.
