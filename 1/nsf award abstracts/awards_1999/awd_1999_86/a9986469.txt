In September 1993, Georgia instituted its then unique
              lottery-funded college scholarship program called HOPE ("Helping Outstanding
              Pupils Educationally"). The scholarship pays the entire tuition, fees and book
              expenses of Georgia citizens who attend state universities and a
              comparably-valued fixed payment to Georgians attending in-state private
              institutions. Since its inception, over $750 million of HOPE scholarship aid
              has been distributed to over 420,000 students. The program's popularity has led
              other states to adopt similar proposals, and President Clinton designated
              Georgia's HOPE Scholarship as the model for the federal HOPE tuition tax
              credit. The defining issue of the 1998 Alabama and South Carolina gubernatorial
              elections was whether to institute a Georgia style scholarship.  Students
              qualify for HOPE entirely on the basis of merit and there are no income
              restrictions. To become eligible, a high-school student must graduate with a
              "B" average. Once in college, the student must maintain a "B" average with a
              minimum number of credits to retain the award. These features, along with its
              overall size and scope, make Georgia's HOPE Scholarship one of the most
              important educational reforms in recent decades. HOPE fits into the national
              trend of offering increasing shares of merit-based aid and therefore affords a
              unique opportunity to learn how merit-based financial aid programs impact
              higher education.

The project provides a rigorous empirical analysis of
              three questions about HOPE that focus on behavioral responses to the
              scholarship: How does HOPE affect decisions to enroll in college? How does
              losing HOPE change postsecondary outcomes? How has HOPE changed students'
              behaviors during their college careers? Each issue introduces many important
              policy implications.
