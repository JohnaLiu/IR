Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, focusses on the development of a powerful method for real space
              surface crystallography of technologically important semiconductor surfaces. 
              Combining experimental measurements of scattered ion angular distributions with
              careful ion trajectory simulations, Professor J. Wayne  Rabalais and his group
              at the University of Houston have developed a unique surface structural tool. 
              This tool is applied to the determination of the structure of compound
              semiconductor surfaces, and to surfaces terminated by hydrogen, where other
              structural tools are ineffective.  The understanding obtained from these
              studies provides important information for the design of semiconductor devices
              and processing conditions.  

In order to utilize semiconductor materials in
              modern electronic devices, detailed knowledge of the surface structure of the
              material is essential.  This research project, being carried out at the
              University of Houston with support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              program, is focussed on the development of ion scattering methods which can
              provide this information accurately.  By combining measurements of scattered
              ion angular distributions with the computed trajectories expected for
              particular surface structures, detailed structural information becomes
              available.  This information can then be applied to the design of semiconductor
              devices and processes.
