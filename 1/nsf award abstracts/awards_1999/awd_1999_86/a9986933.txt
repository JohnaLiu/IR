Abstract    :
              (99), (35), (59) Horry-Georgetown and York Technical Colleges are comprehensive,
              two-year Associate Degree granting institutions in the sixteen-member South
              Carolina Technical and Comprehensive Education System. Each institution enrolls
              approximately 3,500 curricula students, with Horry-Georgetown enrolling over
              325 students in the targeted curricula and York enrolling almost 250. At both
              institutions, over 50% of their enrollment receives PELL or other Federally
              subsidized support. 

Each institution has nationally recognized advanced
              computer and engineering technology curricula that have a specific need (1) to
              assist academically prepared students to complete their two-year degree in the
              prescribed time. All of the participating programs are academically strenuous
              and require a full summer semester between the freshman and sophomore years.
              However, as community colleges with predominantly local/regional enrollments,
              many students to need to work during the summer. Through the implementation of
              the CSEMS grant, the Colleges are identifying up to forty (40) students of
              academic merit who are at risk of not completing their degree requirements due
              to financial need, and to support and insure their graduation.
