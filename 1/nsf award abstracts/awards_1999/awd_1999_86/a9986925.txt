The introduction of genomic technologies to
              elucidate gene function and regulation promises to unleash a flood of new
              information about plant development and metabolism.  RNA profiling is one such
              technology, which allows molecular biologists to study gene expression on a
              genomic scale.  By immobilizing thousands of DNA sequences onto a single chip
              or array, the PI can monitor mRNA levels for thousands of genes at a time.  The
              goal of this proposal is to develop sequence-specific arrays of a select group
              of regulatory genes for expression analysis in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. 
              These arrays will be used to identify genes that regulate flower and fruit
              development and that control rapid metabolic responses to inorganic nutrients
              in plants.
