This work forms part of the larger
              WOCE AIMS program.  Funds are provided for water mass analysis using data sets
              collected by during the WOCE Indian Ocean Experiment along line I1, a zonal
              line of stations near 10 N.  Comparisons with historical data will be used to
              determine how representative this line and products derived from it are. 
              Satellite data, sea surface temperatures and sea level anomalies, will be used
              to estimate heat budgets for the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal.  Time series of
              transport across section I1 will also be estimated using satellite data and
              model output.  It is anticipated that this effort will produce a first
              important step in understanding the ocean's role in monsoon interannual
              variability.
