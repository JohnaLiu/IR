Abstract    :
              Calcitonin is a phylogenetically ancient hormone that is produced by the
              parafollicular C-cells of the thyroid gland in mammals and the ultimobranchial
              gland of all jawed non-mammalian vertebrates.  Despite over 35 years of active
              research and recent use of calcitonin as a therapeutic drug for osteopathic
              diseases, little is known about the definitive role of this enigimatic hormone
              in vertebrate physiology.  The present study will characterize the
              relationships between three processes and calcitonin bioactivity in the
              Atlantic stingray (Dasyatis sabina), a well-studied elasmobranch species. 
              Along with histologic observations on the activity of the ultimobranchial
              gland, these indicators of calcitonin bioactivity will be correlated with
              embryogenic, developmental, and reproductive events in embryonic, neonatal, and
              reproductively active male and female D. sabina.  Preliminary information
              derived from this Minority Research Planning Study will be used to develop a
              focused research plan for identifying the definitive role of calcitonin in
              elasmobranch fishes, the oldest extant vertebrate group to possess this
              hormonal system.
