Abstract    :
              With this renewal proposal the Organic and macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the ongoing work of Dr. Kendall N. Houk in the Department of Chemistry
              at the University of California, Los Angeles.   The work is aimed at developing
              a general theory of organic reactivity in organic chemistry, biochemistry, and
              materials science - using theoretical methods complemented by experimental
              studies carried out in Dr. Houk's laboratories or those of collaborators.  The
              research provides valuable experience for undergraduate, graduate, and
              postdoctoral students.

The research proposed covers a wide range of areas
              including: pericyclic reactions (both those involving diradical pathways, and
              antibody catalysis), the femptochemistry of norbornadiene and
              1,4-cyclohexadiene, the properties of schizo-aromatics and other organic
              electronic materials, and the effects of vinyl and phenyl substituents on Cope
              rearrangements.
