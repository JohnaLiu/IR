              Instrumentation:  Cluster Computing for Knowledge Discovery in Diverse Data
              Sets

The Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of
              Minnesota will purchase the following equipment which will be dedicated to
              support research in computer and information science and engineering.  The
              requested instrumentation consists of 10 dual processor Dell 410 workstations
              with a total of 10GB of main memory, a CISCO Catalyst 4000 Gigabit switch, and
              a Hitachi 5750 E RAID system with a total of 360GB storage.  This equipment
              will be used to form a computer cluster suited for data-and compute-intensive
              applications.

The equipment will be primarily used by four research projects
              which address research problems in the area of knowledge discovery, including
              in particular:  data mining of genomic and scientific data sets, spatial data
              mining, next-generation recommender systems, and bid evaluation in multi-agent
              contracting.  For several of these projects, the currently available equipment
              are either inadequate or obsolete for supporting their core needs.  For other
              projects, the availability of this equipment will make a significant increment
              to their capabilities.  The collective needs of these projects are for a
              tightly-coupled, high-performance, large-memory cluster of computers with a
              high-performance high-capacity storage server attached to it.
