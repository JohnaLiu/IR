Abstract

The
              development of a new biologically-inspired approach to construct spatially
              complex quantum dot heterostructures is proposed. Using combinatorial peptide
              evolution, peptides will be identified that select for and bind to specific
              nanocrystal substrates, such as magnetic and semiconductor quantum dots
              synthesized in solution. The peptides will direct the spatial organization of
              the nanocrystals, which will function as electronic "building blocks," into
              quantum dot heterostructures. Laterally and vertically organized
              semiconductor-magnet quantum dot heterostructures will be
              self-assembled.

The goal is to assemble superlattice heterostructures using
              evolutionarily engineered peptides and nanocrystals to demonstrate the
              nanometer-scale hierarchical control routinely exhibited by living
              systems.

The potential uses of these materials are in next generation
              electronic devices, or hybrid biomolecular systems.
