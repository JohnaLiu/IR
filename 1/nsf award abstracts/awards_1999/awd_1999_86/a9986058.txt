Proposal Title: Nonlinear Magnetohydrodynamic Wave
              Coupling and Dissipation in the Solar Corona

Principal Investigator: Yung

The investigator will examine the
              possibility that the solar corona is heated by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves
              excited at the photosphere. The main effort is to concentrate on numerical
              investigation of inhomogeneous background effects on wave propagation and
              dissipation, using a sequence of idealized models that are nonetheless
              significant advances over previous work. Idealizations to be studied include a
              model of transverse gradients, a model of longitudinal gradients, and a model
              of curvature effects. . Critical processes involve the development of thin
              layers where the variables have high gradients, and nonlinear processes that
              exchange energy among modes and among the fundamental and harmonics. The
              project consists of basic numerical experimentation with a goal of elucidating
              properties and evaluating existing models of the corona and the energy and
              heating budgets associated with its fluctuations.
