This project is a long-term study of a coral reef system. The
              project goals are: 1) to extend the detailed long-term monitoring of ecological
              communities of corals and algae on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, which has
              been carried on continuously over the past 36 years, the longest such study on
              any coral reef; 2) to analyze spatial patterns and dynamics of corals and algae
              at several scales, from mm to kilometers, both during the course of
              colonization of patches (opened by disturbances) and after most of the surface
              has become crowded by many colonies; and 3) to build mathematical models and
              computer simulations of the dynamics of these populations and communities of
              corals and algae that include:  an investigation of past and present conditions
              on future changes;  characterizations of  temporal and spatial dynamics; and
              tests of  hypotheses about the consequences of these dynamics to the community.
              The models also will be used to assess the degree to which community structure
              and dynamics may or may not be influenced by details of spatial relationships
              and interactions.

The significance of this proposed research are: a
              extension of the general knowledge of how natural communities of corals and
              algae are assembled and structured in the face of changes in their environment
              over extended periods of time; a revelation of some of the mechanisms that link
              the environment with these community changes, and how both vary over short and
              long time periods and between small and larger spatial scales; and  an increase
              in our ability to predict the effect of environmental changes, including those
              caused by human activity, on these natural communities.
