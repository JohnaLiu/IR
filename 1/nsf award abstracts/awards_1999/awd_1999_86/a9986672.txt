Abstract    :
              Numerical simulations employing the COMMAS and MM5 models are employed for
              investigating convective phenomena in the atmosphere, with special emphasis on
              phenomena with internally or externally generated boundaries.  The research
              includes the following topics:

(1) convective initiation along
              drylines;
(2) the importance of fronts, outflow boundaries, cloud boundaries,
              and the low-level jet in the Chicago flood of July 17-18, 1996;
(3) dynamics
              and thermodynamics of storm interactions with low-level boundaries;
(4) the
              tornado outbreak of April 19, 1996, in Illinois and adjacent states.

Results
              of these studies provide fundamental insight on atmospheric circulation systems
              and guidance for forecasting severe weather events.
