                Investigation of a New Compressed Representation of Boolean Functions

    
              The goal of the proposed project is to advance the state of the
     art in
              symbolic model checking by investigating the properties of
     a new
              compressed representation of Boolean functions, called
     CFLOBDDs, which
              are an alternative to the now-standard Ordered
     Binary Decision Diagrams
              (OBDDs).  CFLOBDDs share many of the
     good properties of OBDDs, but can
              lead to data structures of
     drastically smaller size -- exponentially
              smaller than OBDDs, in
     fact.  That is, an OBDD is a data structure that
              -- in the best
     case -- yields an exponential reduction in the size of
              the
     representation of a Boolean function (i.e., compared with the
    
              size of the decision tree for the function).  In contrast, a
     CFLOBDD --
              again, in the best case -- yields a doubly exponential
     reduction in the
              size of the representation of a Boolean
     function.  Although not every
              Boolean function has such a highly
     compressed representation, the project
              with see how far this
     idea can be pushed.  The hope is that
              doubly-exponential compression 
     is a tool that would (a) permit
              verification to be performed much 
     faster, and (b) allow much larger
              verification problems to be attacked 
     than has heretofore been
              possible.
