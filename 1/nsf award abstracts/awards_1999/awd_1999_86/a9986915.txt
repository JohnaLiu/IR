Ignace, Richard
"Probing Circumstellar Envelopes with Gravitational
              Microlensing"
AST-9986915

In this project a theoretical basis and
              observational methodology will be developed for interpreting stellar
              gravitational microlensing events that are discovered in the course of ongoing
              monitoring campaigns.  Such events in principle can be used to 'gravitationally
              image' otherwise unresolvable stellar photospheric and circumstellar structures
              when an invisible but massive object passes between the observer and a
              background star.  Current microlensing techniques are useful only by assuming
              normal symmetrical stellar photospheres.  The PIs will extend the technique to
              include microlensing events that involve red giant stars.  The latter have
              highly asymmetrical atmospheric structure, winds, and variations in envelope
              size, velocity and density.  The technique developed also may be useful in
              categorizing lensing events in the nuclei of other nearby normal galaxies such
              as M31 and active galactic nuclei.
Funding for this project was provided by
              the NSF program for Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
