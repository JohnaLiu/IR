Abstract    :
              This proposed research involves the generation of high-resolution,
              precisely-dated tree-ring chronologies from data-sparse subantarctic regions,
              including Tasmania, New Zealand and southern South America. Such records are
              essential for developing a network of Southern Hemisphere paleoclimatic data
              comparable to that which already exists for the Northern Hemisphere. The
              proponents are utilizing the subantarctic chronologies in modeling and
              reconstruction of indices of temperature and atmosphere-ocean circulation for
              the Southern Hemisphere extratropical latitudes. Specific objectives include:
              (1) to develop additional ring-width and maximum latewood density chronologies
              to improve our existing network for subantarctic forest sites; (2) to extend
              selected tree-ring records and reconstructions further back in time using
              living and subfossil wood material; (3) to continue to model and reconstruct
              temperature, precipitation and circulation indices for subantarctic latitudes;
              and (4) to produce chronologies from several additional tree species.
