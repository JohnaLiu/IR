Abstract    :
              Dr. Barnes will undertake an extensive survey of nearby stellar clusters whose
              goal is to determine the dependence of rotation rate on stellar mass and age. 
              The rotation periods will be determined for solar-type stars in carefully
              selected clusters with ages ranging from 300 million years  to 1 billion years
              using photometric observations with a precision of better than one percent. 
              The observational results will be compared to models for the rotational
              evolution of stars, not only with respect to age and mass, but also to other
              properties such as the degree of interaction between stars and their
              circumstellar disks.  This project is likely to provide new insight into the
              role of magnetic disk locking between slow and fast rotation zones, the
              incidence of solid versus differential rotation, and magnetic saturation. 
              These issues directly contribute to our understanding of the interplay between
              the Sun's rotation and activity level. Funding for this project is provided by
              the NSF program for Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
