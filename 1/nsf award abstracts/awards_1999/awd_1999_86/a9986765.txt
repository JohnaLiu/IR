Abstract    :
              The JGOFS program is designed to understand the biological and chemical
              processes that move carbon from the ocean's surface to it's interior and
              bottom.  It's focus has been the euphotic zone, the region where carbon dioxide
              is reduced to organic carbon as part of the photosynthetic process.  Data have
              been collected in the sub-euphotic zone, but there has been no concerted effort
              to relate the processes affecting carbon distributions there, either
              remineralization or fluxes to the benthos.  For this project, the PIs will
              develop a more detailed understanding of carbon flows below the euphotic zone,
              incorporating the role of organisms into biological models.  The model results
              will describe carbon flows between different groups of animals and bacteria. 
              Preliminary models suggest that the timing and magnitude of seasonal
              productivity can dramatically affect the amount of material that passes through
              on its way to the ocean bottom.  The study areas include the sites of the JGOFS
              field programs, starting with that of the North Atlantic Bloom Experiment.  The
              focus on the 100 - 1000 m depth region is important because large amounts of
              organic matter enter as particles settling out of the euphotic zone, but only
              small amounts exit by falling through the bottom.  The project results should
              stimulate further studies of the sub-euphotic zone by highlighting the
              important processes determining the fate of oceanic primary production as well
              as by exposing crucial areas of ignorance.  The results also will help the
              development of better global models of the carbon cycle.  This approach should
              be applicable to future JGOFS studies, particularly those concerned with the
              fate of organic matter.
