Abstract    :
              This project will examine the relationships between calcite solubility, water
              temperature, Mg/Ca and oxygen isotopic ratios in planktic foraminifera. 
              Individual specimens from 6 depth transects in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans
              will be analyzed for geochemical variables and for size-normalized mass,
              concentrating on core tops but including some comparison with samples from the
              last glacial maximum.  The effect of different cleaning techniques upon
              geochemistry will also be examined, and exploratory work witll be done on the
              use of electron microprobe, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption
              spectroscopy to identify the mineralogy of Mg incorporation.
