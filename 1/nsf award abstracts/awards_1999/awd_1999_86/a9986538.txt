NANOSCALE:  Engineered Alpha Helices for Pore-Transport
              Regulation

This exploratory project investigates the fabrication and
              efficacy of nanostructured block-copolymer membranes containing helical
              polymers.  The objective is to mimic biological systems in order to achieve
              high transport selectivity for biological solutes.

Various polymeric
              microstuctures that form helices with varying degrees of hydrophobicity will be
              synthesized and assembled in planar phospholipid monolayers and in vesicular
              membranes.  The ability of the various structures will be probed to determine
              their ability to control solute transport through the membranes according the
              hydrophobicity  of the helix periphery and the resulting pore sizes.  Transport
              measurements are being done with radioactive and fluorescent solutes.
