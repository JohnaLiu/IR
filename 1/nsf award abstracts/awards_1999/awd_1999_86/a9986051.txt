              Instrumentation: Augmented Reality and Interactive Distributed Physical
              Modeling

The schools of Optics and Computer Science at the University of
              Central Florida will purchase Silicon Graphics computers that will be dedicated
              to support research in computer and information science and engineering.  The
              equipment will be used for several projects, including in particular:

1.
              Augmented Reality
Build a framework for augmented reality visualization.  The
              framework includes the development of 3D displays, including head-mounted
              devices; quantitative assessment methods for accuracy and precision of 3D
              rendered depth; physically based models of motion of virtual objects;
              registration methods for real and virtual objects; and statistical texture
              synthesis.

2. A Framework for Distributed Physical Modeling at Interactive
              Speed
Extend the framework developed previously for distributed physical
              modeling to study the effective utilization of non-homogeneous machine clusters
              and to provide data at interactive-speed to augmented and virtual reality
              systems.

3. Dynamic Environmental Features in Virtual Worlds 
Develop
              algorithms for the dynamic generation of vegetation in virtual worlds.  This
              will require the design of new level of detail management algorithms and
              lightweight communication protocols to maintain functionally.
