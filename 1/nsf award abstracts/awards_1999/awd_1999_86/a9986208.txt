Abstract    :
              This USC-ISI award supports work on a Collaborative Simulation for Education and
              Research (CONSER) project.  The CONSER system involves development of
              infrastructure that addresses two purposes: (a) support for research activities
              in the development and evaluation of networking protocols, and (b) teaching in
              the areas of networking protocols and networking concepts.  Based on a
              collaborative simulation environment, CONSER is intended to aid understanding
              of protocol behavior in complex operational environments, over a range of
              traffic conditions, and on a variety of media.  The system will involve
              simulation and visualization support intended to aid researcher and student
              understanding, thus 
providing benefits in both research and teaching
              settings.  Based on ns and nam, the work is expected to be well received by the
              research community and industry.
