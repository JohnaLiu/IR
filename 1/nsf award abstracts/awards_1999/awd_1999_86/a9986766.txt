              ABSTRACT

OCE-9986766

In this project, investigators at the Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution will compile published and unpublished sediment trap
              flux data from the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (U.S.JGOFS) and other
              sources to refine current estimates of regional and global fluxes and
              remineralization of biogenic (organic carbon, aragonite, opal, nitrogen, and
              phosphorous) and lithogenic particulate material input to the ocean interior. 
              They will construct synoptic maps of biogenic and lithogenic fluxes to the
              ocean interior, document systematic regional variations of particle composition
              and flux, evaluate the degree of organic remineralization and nutrient
              regeneration in the upper 1 km of the water column, and estimate recycling
              below 1 kilometer depth.  Additionally they make new measurements on the Th-230
              and Pa-231 content in archived trap particulate samples to correct for
              variations in the collection efficiencies of sediment traps of different
              design.   They will also document the relative importance of various planktonic
              species in the flux of particulate carbonate and silica, estimate the extent of
              recycling of material in surface sediments on the seafloor, and compare fluxes
              of and assess links between lithogenic particles in the water column and
              atmospheric dust input to the ocean.
