Abstract    :
              Martin Grubele of the University of Illinois at Urbana is supported by a grant
              from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his work on
              vibrational energy flow in organic molecules.  This involves (1) the extension
              of his theoretical models to include methanol, pyrrole, acetonitrile, ketene
              and thiophosgene, (2) experimental tests using systems such as CH2CO,
              halogenated thioformaldehydes and benzopyranthione, (3) experimental control of
              vibrational energy flow (IVR) using laser/molecule interactions and (4)
              modeling of IVR.  The experiments will be carried out using stimulated emission
              pumping of expanding molecular beams with ultra fast pump/probe spectroscopy. 
              The theoretical work will be carried out by MFD and SUR computational
              techniques developed by the PI and others.

The studies will further
              understanding of how vibrational energy moves around complex organic molecules
              by exciting an expanding beam of molecules by stimulated emission or ultrafast
              laser pumping.  This will be theoretically modeled using large scale ab initio
              RRKM based theory.  The laser pumping will also be used to slow down the rate
              of energy transfer, thus initiating the first stage of controlling chemical
              reactions.  This has important implications to photochemistry.
