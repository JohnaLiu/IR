Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              novel photonic ModeRouting networks containing many nodes for monitoring and
              controlling the structural health and function of complex systems.  Each node
              is, in general, a microsystem that combines sensing, computing, and actuating
              functions.  The microsystems may contain many Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems
              (MEMS) with aggregate data rates approaching gigabits-per-second.  This
              research addresses the enormous challenge for interrogating, activating, and
              controlling all microdevices through a high-capacity interconnection system. 
              Wire-based and wireless approaches cannot handle such data rates.  Further
              problems include operation in electrically noisy and potentially explosive
              environments.  The innovative IFOS solution offers high-efficiency, ultra-high
              capacity, electromagnetic-interference-immunity, electrical-passivity, and
              expendability.  Phase II will optimize, fabricate, and test several MEMS array
              nodes, MEMS fiber interfacing, and PhotoPowering, as well as design and build
              an expandable, ModeRouting network of MEMS nodes.   

Commercial applications
              of the IFOS photonically-interconnected MEMS array networks include civil,
              mechanical, aerospace, chemical, and marine engineering, particularly
              monitoring and control of programmable structures by microsensors and
              microactuators for mechanical systems, electrical power plants, automobiles,
              materials processing, and medicine.
