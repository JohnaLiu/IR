Abstract    :
              This action provides funds for  the LIGO Visitors Program at the Laser
              Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The LIGO Visitors Program
              supports visitors to the LIGO Laboratories, at all levels and ranks, who wish
              to become involved in the science and techniques associated with the detection
              of gravitational waves with interferometric techniques.  Visitors contribute
              their accumulated skills and abilities to enhance the performance of the LIGO
              team. 

The LIGO Laboratory Visitors Program is oriented towards activities
              at the LIGO Observatories at Hanford, WA, and Livingston, LA as well as at the
              Caltech or MIT LIGO Laboratories. The program has three parts: short term
              visits as short as one month; long term visits of six months or more; and
              international exchanges between the scientists from the VIRGO project in Europe
              and LIGO.

A agreement between the CNRS (Centre Nationale de Recherche
              Scientifique - France) and the National Science Foundation was implemented to
              fund an exchange program between VIRGO and LIGO for a three-year period. There
              is a mutual exchange of scientists and engineers associated with both projects.
               Each year, three group leaders, either from the LIGO Laboratory or the LIGO
              science community at large, visit VIRGO for about four days, and four working
              scientists associated with LIGO visit VIRGO for a minimum stay of at least two
              weeks. Similarly, VIRGO will send its scientists and engineers to visit LIGO
              sites.
