Abstract    :
              This project will upgrade and reorganize the paleontology collections at the San
              Diego Museum of Natural History.  The collections comprise over a million
              specimens of fossil vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants collected primarily
              from Mesozoic through Cenozoic sites in Southern California, and northern Baja
              California, Mexico.  Since 1994, the paleontology collections have grown an
              average of 8% per year, and as a result the collection has outgrown its current
              space.  Many items are stored in overcrowded conditions in individual specimen
              drawers, on open shelving, and on case tops.  Databasing is incomplete.  A move
              to a new space has made it possible to reorganize the collection and make
              feasible complete computerization and databasing.  The computerized collections
              will be made available in a fully searchable, web-accessible database.
