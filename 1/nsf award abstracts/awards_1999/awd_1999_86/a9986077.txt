Abstract    :
              The global environment contains many natural and synthetic compounds that can
              mimic the effects of estrogens and other reproductive hormones.  These
              compounds have the potential to adversely affect reproductive development and
              function in humans, wildlife and domestic animals. Previously, the PIs found a
              startling 16-fold difference among strains of laboratory mouse in their
              sensitivity to endocrine disruption. The resistance is proposed to have evolved
              inadvertently, while the strains were being selected for large litter size in
              the presence of estrogenic compounds. This project will characterize the
              physiological mechanisms mediating genetic variation in susceptibility to
              endocrine disruption by estrogenic agents in laboratory and wild strains of
              mice.  The proposed work will also help determine the suitability of animal
              models for detecting endocrine disruption by estrogenic agents, and is designed
              to enhance the development of more sensitive bioassays for detecting endocrine
              disruption.
