Abstract    :
              This is an application for a planning grant of $10,000 to join and existing NSF
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Pharmaceutical Processing,
              established at Purdue University with an affiliated site at the University of
              Connecticut.  This application is from four faculty members in three
              departments, Pharmaceutics, Food Science and Nutrition, and Chemistry, at the
              University of Minnesota.  This application  stresses the fundamental
              understanding, at the molecular level, the effects of processing on critical
              quality attributes of pharmaceutical products and in minimizing validation
              requirements through improved process monitoring.  The plan is to recruit six
              additional industrial companies to become members of the Center, to prepare a
              descriptive brochure, and to participate fully in the Center's activities.
