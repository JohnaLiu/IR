"'An Unexplored Country': 
              American Sex Research and the Rise of the Survey, 1900-1948"

This research
              project examines the history, methodology, and cultural implications of sex
              research in the United States during the first half of the twentieth century.
              The author of one 1920s sex survey referred to the field as "an unexplored
              country," but by 1948, when Alfred Kinsey's Sexual Behavior in the Human Male
              brought the survey to the attention of a mass public, more than thirty American
              researchers had produced quantitative studies of human sexual behavior. This
              study will focus on several key questions: Who conducted sex research before
              Kinsey, and from what motives? How did they define their topics and choose
              their subjects? What methodological and cultural debates did sex researchers
              engage in, and how did their work relate to other kinds of enquiry into human
              behavior? Who read sex surveys, and how were they received and used by their
              audiences? Particular attention will be paid to the sex survey, which quickly
              emerged as the approach of most sex researchers: what accounts for its rapid
              spread and epistemological supremacy?

The investigators will examine
              published and unpublished sex surveys and the archives of significant sex
              researchers and funding institutions and will place them in scientific,
              historical, statistical and cultural context. The resulting work, which will
              illuminate the development of the field of sex research, will be of interest
              not only to historians of science and social science and to sex researchers,
              but also to a general readership.
