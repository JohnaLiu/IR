Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop an on-line flow cytometry system.  A
              sorting flow cytometer will be interfaced to a bioreactor.  The interface will
              allow automatic sampling and staining of the cells.  The primary application of
              the on-line flow cytometry system will be on monitoring culture physiology at
              the single-cell level.  Specifically, experiments will be carried out to
              determine single cell glucose uptake rates for E. coli, the fraction of S.
              cerevisae cells undergoing mitosis and, finally, for the isolation of E. coli
              transport mutants.
