The proposed project, "The Earth Puzzle," is a series
              of four (4) modules that focus on teaching core concepts in Earth science for
              9th grade students.  The modules are based in case studies of real problems
              using real data.  The problems will involve global scale investigations to
              provide a framework for understanding local case studies.  Topics addressed by
              students include weather and climate change, natural hazards mitigation, and
              changing Earth systems.  The materials will incorporate geographic information
              systems (GIS) technology to facilitate data visualization, manipulation and
              analysis.  Special attention will be given to integrating mathematics and
              geography into the curriculum.  Assessment and evaluation studies will focus in
              whether student knowledge and reasoning skills are improved by the in-depth
              activities of the proposed materials.
