Huggins, Patrick
"Circumstellar Matter: Neutral Shells & Planetary
              Nebula Formation"
AST-9986159

This project continues the PI's study of
              neutral envelopes of the planetary nebula stage of stellar evolution.  The
              proposed work will include several new areas of investigation:  (1) the shaping
              of planetary nebulae by jets;  (2) episodic mass loss and chemical changes; 
              (3)  globule and knot formation in the ejecta; and (4) circumstellar envelope
              evolution.  The results will contribute substantially to improving our
              understanding of the latest stages of stellar evolution and how matter
              ultimately is returned to the interstellar medium.  The models that are
              developed will be extensively compared to ground- and space-based
              multiwavelength observations.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF
              program for Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
