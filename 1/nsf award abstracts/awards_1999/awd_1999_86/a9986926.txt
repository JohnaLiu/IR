Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthesis of molecular motors.  The concept of
              energy-driven bond rotation in a preferred direction will be explored using the
              formation of activated carboxyl intermediates and the relief of ring strain.  A
              second test of the concept will rely on photochemical nucleophilc aromatic
              substitution.  

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research of Dr. Bruce P. Branchaud of the Department
              of Chemistry at the University of Oregon.  Professor Branchaud will focus his
              work on the systematic study of the design, synthesis and evaluation of
              molecules which should be capable of acting as single-molecule motors. The main
              objective of the current project will be to test the concept for controlled
              energy-driven rotation about C-C bonds in a preferred direction.  In the
              future, the research could lead to broader impact in the preparation of working
              single-molecule motor-driven devices.  The field of the project is one that
              should spark the imaginations of students and provide them with excellent
              training.
