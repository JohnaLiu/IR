Abstract    :
              Power management as one of the major challenges in integrated circuit (IC)
              design that will be faced beyond 2006. This project is aimed at power
              management using micro-scale heat-removal devices that can be integrated with
              functional logic in dense, high-performance ICs. An evaluation of heat-removal
              microstructures such as an array of micro heat pipes is being carried out. An
              on-chip heat-removal architecture using micro heat pipes is being investigated,
              and computer-aided design tools for automatic insertion of heat spreaders are
              being developed. It is expected that this research will lead to a synthesis
              environment in which design primitives for heat removal will be integrated with
              functional primitives such as gates, latches, and standard cells.
