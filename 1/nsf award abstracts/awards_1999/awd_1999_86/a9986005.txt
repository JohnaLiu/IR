Abstract    :
              This is a project to measure total cross sections for excitation and ionization
              resulting from scattering of electrons off atoms in an excited state.   Within
              a gas discharge the net effects of these processes can be larger than the
              effects of the corresponding processes out of the ground state level.  
              Measurements will focus on the four rare gas atoms, neon, argon, krypton, and
              xenon.   The use of two complementary apparatuses will make it possible to
              carry out the measurements over a wide energy range and for many different
              final levels.   Results of the measurements will enrich the basic understanding
              of electron impact processes and provide fundamental information needed for new
              technological advances.
