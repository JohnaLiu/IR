Dr. Lai is conducting a theoretical and computational
              study of orbiting gas around accreting high gravity objects such as neutron
              stars.  Special emphasis is placed on achieving a physical understanding of how
              strong magnetic fields drive the warping of an accretion disk, its precession
              and any resonances that develop.  The problem is approached from several
              fronts: (1) basic calculations of the magnetic forces and torques for realistic
              magnetic field - disk geometry;  (2) analytic and numerical modeling of the
              dynamics of warped precessing disks; and (3) comparison of the computed models
              to the observed spin evolution, oscillations and super-orbital variability of
              X-ray binaries.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for
              Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
