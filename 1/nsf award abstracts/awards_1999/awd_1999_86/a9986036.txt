The objective of this research is to develop a novel
              approach to membrane protein structural characterization by solid state NMR
              without the need for resonance assignments. This is due to the recent
              observation of resonance patterns in PISEMA (15N-1H dipolar - 15N chemical
              shift) spectra.  By a combination of uniform 15N labeling and amino acid
              specific labeling, both the tilt and rotational orientation of transmembrane
              helices can be obtained. While this represents an exciting development for
              obtaining an early structural image, a combination of distance and assigned
              orientational constraints will still be important for gleaning the full
              potential from the solid state NMR-derived constraints. The optimal utilization
              of these constraints is being aided by a detailed mathematical analysis of
              helices and helical bundles. Through refinement against all of the structural
              constraints and the CHARMM energy, it is possible to achieve a very high
              resolution structure. Cross-validation will be used to assess the relative
              weights in the experimental and energetic parameters for these refinements.
