Abstract    :
              This SGER award is for the determination of the research needs for a national
              Data Collection Center (DCC) that will serve the Interagency Education Research
              Initiative (IERI) data collection, aggregation, and dissemination needs to
              implement the long term goals of the IERI.  These goals include fostering
              innovative research on technology driven scalable and sustainable education
              interventions.  The planning grant will conduct meta-evaluations of the all the
              research and evaluation designs for the IERI projects with the intent of
              developing a service that will enable the results to be both disseminated and
              used by other researchers. The planning grant will involve the IERI principle
              investigators in addition to a National Advisory Committee. The results of this
              planning grant will be used to define the research requirements for a DCC to
              serve the goals of the IERI. These requirements will be used in any future
              competition for a national DCC.
