Abstract    :
              Many molecules have been described that stimulate or guide axons, but less is
              known about the molecules that cause axons to stop and form specialized
              synaptic contacts.  This project focuses on a postsynaptic molecule,
              commissureless (comm), that has such a function and is required for synapse
              formation at the neuromuscular junction of Drosophila.  The proposed
              experiments will determine whether comm works autonomously and whether it acts
              by regulating the endocytic resurfacing of postsynaptic cells.  Since comm
              appears to be one of the major coordinators of neuromuscular junction, further
              characterization of its mechanism of action will enhance our knowledge of
              synaptogenesis.
