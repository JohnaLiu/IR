Funding is provided for participation in
              a process study (GASEX 20001) designed to understanding the air-sea fluxes of
              carbon dioxide (CO2) in the eastern Equatorial pacific, a region of relatively
              low winds and strong source of CO2. This region offers a strong contrast with
              North Atlantic (high winds, large sink ofCo2) that was studied in 1998. The
              emphasis of the study is on using direct flux estimates to investigate the
              processes limiting or enhancing gas exchange. The in-situ will be extrapolated
              to remote sensing.
