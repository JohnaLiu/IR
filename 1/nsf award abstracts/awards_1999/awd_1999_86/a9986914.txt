Abstract    :
              (99), (31), (21), (59), (35) The college is located in an area which has seen an
              influx of minority immigration over the last decade. In addition, the area's
              technology-driven manufacturing base and the need for a well-educated workforce
              are on the increase. To enable and expand the participation of the area
              population in higher education, the college is initiating a scholarship project
              for low-income, academically talented students seeking the high-tech skills for
              today's workplace. Recruitment efforts concentrate on students from the
              twenty-five school districts in Western Arkansas and two Oklahoma counties that
              make up the college's service area. Efforts target those demographic groups
              currently under-represented on campus as well as students currently enrolled in
              selected disciplines.

Full-time students intent on completing associate
              degrees in engineering, mathematics, computer science, and computer technology
              receive up to $2500 per year in financial aid. Recipients also benefit from a
              project design that seeks to increase retention from recruitment to graduation
              or placement by providing dedicated services that focus on mastering skills and
              features customized advising, mentoring, and work based experiences.

This
              project is designed to improve education for students by teaching critical
              thinking, time management, note taking, teamwork, listening and speaking
              skills, as well as technical writing and other academic skills. Recipients also
              strengthen relationships with area businesses by participating in various
              workplace experiences designed to increase their insight into the world of work
              and promote professional development.
