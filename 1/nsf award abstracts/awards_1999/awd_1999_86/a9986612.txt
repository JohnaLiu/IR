This project builds on the earlier funded Mosaic Study and
              proposes to maintain the focus that relates instructional practice to student
              achievement in mathematics and science programs, but extends the research in
              several ways.  

1. The project will focus primarily on middle school
              classrooms.

2. It will follow students over a three-year period to permit
              longitudinal analyses of the relationships     between achievement and
              instructional practice.

3. Measures of teaching practices will be expanded
              to include interviews, classroom observations, inspection of artifacts, etc. 
              This will allow exploration of teacher content knowledge and broader aspects of
              the     systemic initiatives that are directly related to teaching and
              learning.

4. The project will involve a closer examination of student
              achievement by exploring the degree to which        selected assessment
              subscores are or are not sensitive to the reforms.

5. Three to five sites
              will be identified for participation in the study.

6. The new analytic
              techniques developed by this project will be useful to researchers and
              practitioners as     they evaluate future programs.
