              Abstract

This project will focus on the relationship of affinely-invariant
              measures to
certain problems in harmonic analysis. Drury observed that affine
              arclength
appears to be the natural measure to use when considering averaging
              and Fourier
restriction operators associated with certain curves. More
              recently, the PI has
obtained certain uniform results along these lines for
              curves in two dimensions
and for surfaces in higher dimensions. He intends to
              continue these
investigations and also to consider some questions of an
              integral-geometric
nature. The latter stem from the concept of affine
              dimension, an analog of
Hausdorff dimension which also takes into account a
              set's curvature.

The averaging operators considered in this project belong
              to a class of smoothing
operators which play an important role in the study of
              physical processes like
wave motion and heat propagation. These operators are
              also related to the Radon
transforms which appear in tomography. Similar
              operators are important in signal
analysis and communications theory. The
              Fourier restriction operators considered
here are part of the theory of
              Fourier analysis. Their study contributes to the
general understanding of the
              Fourier transform, a tool which is vital to
applications of mathematics
              ranging from electrical engineering and
communications theory through fluid
              dynamics.
