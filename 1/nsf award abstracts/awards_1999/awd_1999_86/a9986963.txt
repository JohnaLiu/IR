Abstract    :
              (99), (31), (59) The United States is currently facing a shortage of engineers
              and computer scientists, a shortage which is growing worse as colleges and
              universities continue to graduate an insufficient number of these professionals
              each year. Even more disturbing is the severe underrepresentation of women and
              minorities in engineering and computer science. In order to maintain the United
              States' role as a technological leader, it is essential that we strive to
              include more diverse perspectives in these fields. To this end, the university
              is increasing the number of women and minorities who complete degree programs
              in engineering and computer science at community colleges as well as at the
              bachelor's and master's levels.  Scholarships are offered to exceptional
              students with financial need, targeting recruitment strategies to increase the
              number of underrepresented minorities in these fields. These students are being
              provided with a strong support infrastructure which ensures that they have the
              resources they need to graduate and to find rewarding careers in engineering
              and computer science.  This program provides immediate benefits to students at
              the university and at partnering community colleges and also benefits
              underrepresented students nationwide because, through dissemination efforts,
              U.S. in Engineering and Computer Science serves as a model for colleges and
              universities across the country.
