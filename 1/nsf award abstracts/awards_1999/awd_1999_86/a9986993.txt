Abstract    :
              The Program will address the national workforce need to increase substantially
              the number of graduates of associate degree programs in Computer Science,
              Computer Technology, and Engineering Technology fields. Seven objectives will
              guide the Program activities and produce measurable outcomes by the conclusion
              of the project in August 2002: 

1. Improved education of participating
              students by August 2002;
2. Increased participation of underrepresented groups
              in Computer Science, Computer Technology, and Engineering Technology
              disciplines by August 2002;
3. Increased retention of students to degree
              achievement for CSEMS scholars by August 2002;
4. Improved professional
              development and employment/further higher education placement of participating
              students by August 2002; 
5. Strengthened partnerships between university and
              related employment sectors by August 2002; 
6. Institutionalization of
              scholarship best practices by fall 2002; 
7. Support the university's
              strategic priority and applicable strategic goals throughout the duration of
              the program.

The Program will provide educational opportunities to
              financially disadvantaged, academically-talented students through scholarships
              that promote full-time enrollment and Associate in Applied Science degree
              achievement in Computer Science, Computer Technology, and Engineering
              Technology programs of study. The Scholarship Selection Committee will
              designate up to 40 applicants per academic year in the 2000-01 and 2001-02
              academic years to each receive a $2,500 scholarship per academic year.
	
The
              Program will employ a comprehensive plan of targeted student recruitment,
              assessment, orientation, admissions counseling, advisement, academic placement
              and support, mentoring, monitoring and follow-up, internship guidance, and
              employment placement assistance to meet the goal and objectives of the program.
              Groups underrepresented in appropriate fields will receive special
              consideration to promote their participation. 

The significance of this
              project will be to develop a model of effective student recruitment and
              retention that can be delivered through scholarship programs.
