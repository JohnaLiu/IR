              ABSTRACT

OCE-  9986038

The export flux of carbon from the surface ocean to
              the oceanic interior is an important component of the global carbon cycle as it
              reflects the surface primary production of particulate organic matter and the
              environmental processes which affect this production. This project will allow
              the continuation of the Oceanic Flux Program (OFP) which for the past 21 years
              has provided continuous particle flux measurements in the deep Sargasso Sea.
              This provides investigators the opportunity to observe inter-annual and
              seasonal variations in the production of surface particles, and in conjunction
              with the continuous oceanic time-series studies being carried out by the BATS
              site (Bermuda Time-Series), allows inferences to be drawn on how the ocean and
              its biota naturally respond to climate and environmental forcing variability.
