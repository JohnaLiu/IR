Abstract    :
              This project will analyze 31,000 video-camera images taken during several
              cruises in the region of 9 degrees N on the East Pacific Rise.  The project
              will map lava flow morphology and distribution and assess the relation between
              tectonic and magmatic processes via the distribution of fractures and faults. 
              Specific topics to be addressed include (1) the role of channels in
              transporting axial lavas downslope, contributing to the thickening of crustal
              Layer 2A, (2) the generation of Pillow ridges on the eastern flank, (3) the
              effect of effusion rate and seafloor topography upon flow morphology and (4)
              the relation of fault and fissure density to topography, volcanic processes and
              crustal architecture.
