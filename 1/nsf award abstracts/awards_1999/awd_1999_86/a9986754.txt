Rankin, Joanna
"Electrodynamics Through Subbeam Circulation
              Mapping"
AST-9986754

The PI proposes to investigate the hypothesis that
              pulsar subpulses contain structure that gives information on the spatial and
              temporal properties of the emitting region.  Preliminary pseudo-maps of the
              emitting near-polar region have been constructed from pulse data for one pulsar
              (0031-07).  An international collaboration involving collaborators in the U.S.
              and India will provide data on a number of additional pulsars.  The intent is
              to establish whether the widely differing subpulses in other pulsars can be
              interpreted using this technique.  The project will be conducted in
              collaboration with the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, India.
Funding
              for this project was provided by the NSF program for Stellar Astronomy &
              Astrophysics (AST/SAA) and the NSF International Program for Africa, Near East
              & South Asia (INT/India & Nepal).
