Abstract    :
              This project will investigate low energy ion irradiation effects and defect
              interactions in near surface regions of semiconductors with the use of STM,
              grazing incidence x-ray diffuse scattering, and computational modeling. The
              objective of the project is to establish a greater understanding of defect
              reactions near surfaces during low-energy ion implantation. The approach is to
              utilize tunneling microscopy (STM), x-ray scattering (DXS) methods, and
              computational modeling. This combination of experimental techniques will enable
              observation of defects and defect structure developing at the surface as well
              as just below it. Computational modeling will be used to calculate the initial
              damage states of the surface and near-surface region for analysis of the DXS
              data, and as an aid in interpreting the STM data.

The project addresses
              basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high
              potential technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials
              science knowledge at a fundamental level to new understanding and capabilities
              in electronic devices. An important feature of the program is the integration
              of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally
              and technologically significant area.
