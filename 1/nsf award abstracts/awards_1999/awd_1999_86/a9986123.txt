Abstract    :
              Conjugated molecules are promising components of thin film transistors (TFTs)
              and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).  Their performance characteristics
              in these devices are critically dependent on their solid state structure and
              morphology which, in turn, depends on their molecular structure.  In this
              project, conjugated oligomers and molecular packing in a predicted manner will
              be synthesized.  Molecular properties, e.g. ionization potential, electron
              affinity, polarizability, etc., will be fine tuned by synthesizing co-polymers
              or "co-oligomers" using component structures that impart the desired
              characteristics.  A combination of X-ray crystallography and spectroscopy will
              be used to determine the molecular packing and its effect on the optoelectronic
              properties of the new materials.  For TFTs, the optimum packing motif has the
              molecules arranged in closely spaced (3.5A)  -stacks with the axis of the
              stacking direction collinear with the direction of current flow. 
              Langmuir-Blodgett techniques will be used to align the functionalized molecules
              on substrate (electrode) surfaces, and effects of molecular structure and solid
              state packing on the transport properties will be determined.  
These new
              materials will have well defined solid state structures that may give better
              performance in flat panel displays, "smart cards", environmental sensors, and
              related applications involving conjugated polymers and organic solids.
