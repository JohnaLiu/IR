Iron-Oxidizing Bacteria in the Wetland Plant
              Rhizosphere: Characterization of a Novel Microbial Niche

Wetlands are places
              where iron changes form a reduced form (Fe2+) to an oxidized form (Fe3+) in the
              presence of O2.  We know this process occurs around wetland plant roots because
              they often have a rust-colored Fe3+ coating.  Most scientists believe Fe
              oxidation is spontaneous and that it does not involve microorganisms.  However,
              we discovered bacteria on wetland plant roots that oxidize Fe3+ for energy and
              we suspect they control Fe oxidation rates in wetland soils.  We also suspect
              that the Fe coatings that these organisms produce are more available to
              Fe-reducing microbes than those in the bulk soil.  We will use laboratory and
              field experiments to test these hypotheses.  The work is important because Fe
              cycling affects the behavior of several other elements including some
              pollutants.  Of particular interest is the fact that iron cycling may affect
              the amount of methane released from wetlands; methane is a major greenhouse
              gas.
