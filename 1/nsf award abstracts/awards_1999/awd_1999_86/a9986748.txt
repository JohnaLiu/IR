Abstract    :
              This project will address a hypothesized link between export of North Atlantic
              Intermediate Water to the South Atlantic and warming of South Atlantic upper
              waters.  Model predictions indicate that during glacial intervals the reduction
              of NADW export should produce accumulation of upper ocean heat in the South
              Atlantic.  The project will analyze stable isotopes and Cd/Ca in benthic
              foraminifera from a depth transect of cores on the Brazil margin.  Emphasis
              will be upon the last glacial maximum, but exploratory work will also be done
              to determine if there is dateable evidence for rapid events during the earlier
              intervals (Isotope Stages 3-6).
