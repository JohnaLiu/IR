Abstract    :
              This project is to develop new DNA delivery systems based on modular, nano-scale
              assembly concepts, and to use these new materials to examine mechanisms of DNA
              uptake, transport, and expression in cells.  These concepts are inspired by
              certain characteristics of viruses, and are to be reproduced using totally
              
synthetic materials.
