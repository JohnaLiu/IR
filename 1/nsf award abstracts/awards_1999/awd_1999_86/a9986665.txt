Abstract    :
                   The researchers propose to investigate and to demonstrate an optical
              networking technique that offers extremely high performance and flexibility,
              targeting the goals of the Next Generation Internet and beyond. In particular,
              the researchers will study the Optical-Label Switching technique which offers
              the following unique properties:  1) Accommodates signals of any protocol and
              format, 2) Achieves ultra-low latency transport of high burst rate packets, 3)
              Requires no network or packet synchronization, 4) Interoperates with both
              circuit-switched and packet-switched traffic, 5) Automatically detects and
              restores network failures, and 6) Provides on-demand Quality of Service (QoS)
              and priority based differentiated services.
     The proposed effort makes
              comprehensive studies of the Next Generation Internet, and seeks
innovations
              in both hardware and software. Specifically, the researchers will pursue an
              integrated effort of the following research activities: 1) NGI architecture and
              protocol studies, which will design and simulate an optimum network,
              architecture and protocol to transport optical packets over multi-wavelength
              signals, 2)  NGI network control & management (NC&M), and signaling, which will
              pursue efficient and rapid routing of packets while intelligently reflecting
              the network traffic conditions, 3) NGI network element design and optical
              technologies, which will design, simulate, and prototype network elements that
              effectively route packets while resolving packet contentions, and 4) NGI
              Testbed Integration and Demonstration, which will bring network elements and
              NC&M together to implement a testbed and to experimentally demonstrate broad
              aspects of networking research covered in this proposed effort. The designed
              architecture, protocol, and network elements will be put to test at this step
              and the simulation results will be experimentally verified.
