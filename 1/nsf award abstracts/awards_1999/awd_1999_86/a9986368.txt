Abstract    :
              9986368

This is a multi-disciplinary project to examine a variety of
              non-linear
wave processes in the ocean and atmosphere as well as attempting to
              
refine some of the numerical methods used to model the dynamics of
              
geophysical fluids. The former are problems relevant to both atmospheric
              
and oceanic sciences and include baroclinic wave packets, tropical
              
instability waves, and mesoscale (in the atmospheric sense) solitary
              
internal gravity waves.  In addition, the PI will address computational
              
mathematics issues associated with some of the spectral and
              
spectral-element codes used in geophysical problems, particularly 
the
              issues of filtering and compatibility conditions.
