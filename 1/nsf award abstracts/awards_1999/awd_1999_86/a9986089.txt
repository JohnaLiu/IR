Abstract    :
              In collaboration with the Dissertations Online project in Germany,  this project
              will begin a joint effort to facilitate a distributed, multilingual digital
              library of doctoral theses and dissertations and  promote the use of these
              materials to develop courseware and other  knowledge resources for students,
              faculty and researchers. Of  particular relevance is research regarding
              multilingual information  retrieval, metadata, document markup (XML), natural
              language constructs, interoperability protocols, and multimedia capture and 
              presentation. A goal of this research is to create an effective multilingual
              search system originally English/German, but readily extensible to other
              languages, and suggest new means to create and test large-scale, federated,
              multilingual digital libraries.
