Abstract    :
              This project will explore the fabrication and use of micro to nano scale
              ferromagnetic structures, which will be used to isolate and fractionate
              biological objects.  The initial emphasis will be on the interaction of the
              fabricated structures with ferro and superparamagnetic beads which have been
              coated with biologically specific antibodies.  The extremely high magnetic
              field gradients possible with nanofabricated magnetic structures can be used to
              achieve extremely specific cell capture and isolation.  The initial emphasis
              will also be on conventional nickel-based thin film magnetics, although we hope
              to begin fabrication of higher permeability multilayer magnetic materials and
              explore writing magnetic domains directly on engineered magnetic disk surfaces.
