Abstract    :
              This research project is undertaken to guide the construction of new markets on
              the Internet. It will help answer the following questions: Should the order
              flow be accessible only to specialists or to everyone? Should last-second
              orders be penalized? Should only one side of the market (say sellers) post
              price, or both sides? Should automated buyers and sellers be encouraged or
              discouraged? In general, how effective is a new market in quickly leading
              intelligent (but self-interested) traders to efficient transactions and
              encouraging their participation? Three projects will be carried out to answer
              these questions. The first project examines how automated access strategies
              affect Internet congestion. The second project compares the effectiveness of
              alternative market institutions in Internet-like environments. The third
              project compares alternative pricing schemes for Internet access. Four
              complementary methodologies will be employed: 1) theoretical models of market
              equilibrium and transient performance; 2) computer simulations of traders and
              their market interactions; 3) laboratory markets with human traders interacting
              with automated traders; and 4) statistical analysis of recent Internet
              activity.
