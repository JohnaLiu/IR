              ABSTRACT

OCE-9986061

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts at
              Dartmouth will participate in an larger expedition to the Southern Ocean
              (SOFeX) in austral summer of 2001-2002 to study the effects of mesoscale
              fertilization of the water column with iron.   Specifically, these
              investigators will  study the response of stable nitrogen and carbon isotope
              cycling to iron fertilization.  Their goal is to use these isotopes as tracers
              to first determine the magnitude and mechanisms of nitrogen isotopic
              fractionation in response to an episodic iron input and thus to predict what
              kind of paleoceanographic signal would be generated (and preserved in the
              underlying sediments).  Secondly, they will assess the feasibility of using
              stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon as in situ transient tracers of nitrogen
              and carbon transfers in these open-water mesoscale perturbation
              experiments.
