              ABSTRACT

Harrison, Thomas
"Infrared Spectroscopy of Cataclysmic Variables: 
              Using the Peculiar Surface Abundance Patterns Found in Secondary Stars to Trace
              Their Evolutionary History"
AST-9986823

Dr. Harrison will undertake one of
              the first large-scale infrared spectroscopic surveys of cataclysmic variable
              stars.  The primary goal of the project will be to investigate the chemical
              abundances and isotopic ratios of carbon in the secondary stars of these
              rapidly evolving systems.  The observed spectra will be compared to existing
              models for evolved and unevolved stars to determine the current evolutionary
              state and trace the history of each system.  The observational effort will be
              conducted with the facilities at Kitt Peak National Observatory.
Funding for
              this project was provided by the NSF program for Stellar Astronomy &
              Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
