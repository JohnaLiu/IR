Abstract    :
              This project will focus on the ways that shape and size of small crystals affect
              the surface chemistry and consolidation of nanocrystals of certain ionic,
              inorganic materials.  A study of synthetic methods that yield nanocrystals with
              unusual morphologies, and how these morphologies affect intrinsic surface
              adsorption properties and consolidation properties, will be carried out.  In
              addition to adsorption studies, chemical reactivity studies will be obtained
              for selected nano- and microcrystals to compare catalytic processes such as
              methanol synthesis from carbon dioxide and hydrogen over magnesium oxide,
              alcohol dehydrogenation over calcium oxide, and selective hydrogenation of
              dienes over magnesium oxide.

The results of this work will result in new
              synthetic approaches to the discovery and production of moderate to large
              quantities of broad, new classes of porous, inorganic adsorbants and catalysts.
               The control of pore size and pore volume in the consolidated materials will be
              useful in gas separation by diffusion control, and in the important areas of
              catalysis.  These are important areas for training of students since they are
              priority areas within industry that are highly relevant to economic growth that
              will provide excellent job opportunities.
