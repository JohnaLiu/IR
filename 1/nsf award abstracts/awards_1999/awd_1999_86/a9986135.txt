Abstract    :
              Award is for documenting the sequences of reactions, temperatures, and nature
              and chemistry of fluids that are associated with the formation of sepentinite
              during hydrothermal alteration of oceanic peridotite at slow spreading ridges. 
              A principle goal is the quantitative evaluation of imperfectly understood, yet
              is critical for evaluation of global geochemical fluxes, and the influence
              these fluxes and alteration processes have on the physical and chemical
              properties of oceanic lithosphere.  These fluxes also exert fundamental control
              on biotic communities associated with this lithosphere, especially at oceanic
              ridges.  The proposed work involves a comprehensive and this lithosphere,
              expecially at oceanic ridges.  The proposed work involves a comprehensive and
              systematic study of dredged and drilled peridotic exhibiting varying amounts of
              alteration. This study will include detailed mineralogical analysis, including
              analyzing geochemical and isotopic compositions of individual minerals to infer
              bulk sample geochemistry.
