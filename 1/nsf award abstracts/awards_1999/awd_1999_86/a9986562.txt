Poole, Marshall Scott

Although it has been actively
              pursued in numerous disciplines, group research remains fragmented.  Scholars
              in different fields work largely in isolation from each other.  To capitalize
              both on the advances of the past and on the present energy directed to group
              research, it is important to link disparate areas and to foster integrative
              positions.  We propose an extended conference of about 30 group theorists and
              researchers from diverse fields to take stock of the major findings in group
              research and to assess the current status of theory.  To promote constructive
              discussion among the different viewpoints the conference will be structured as
              follows: (1) it will incorporate extended periods of work through electronic
              group conferencing to articulate positions and search for commonalities,
              differences, and insights; and (2) it will utilize a two-stage conference
              structure that asks participants first to develop their preferred theories in
              their own terms and then to develop integrative positions between theories. 
              Expected products include books that integrate existing theory and research
              across fields, an agenda for future work, and development of an approach for
              interdisciplinary groups of scholars to engage in distributed work.
