This proposal outlines a method for electrostatic
              coupling of the charge on macro-molecular chains (e.g., nucleic acids and
              polypeptides) to the flow of electrons from source to drain of a gated
              metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) and proposes to
              explore and demonstrate the method's ability to determine size, charge, and
              base composition by using the gain of the transistor. Two different geometries
              are proposed: the first, a front fluid flow channel device, with a flow channel
              5-20 nm by 1-10 nm in cross-section and placed in between the gate and the
              electron channel of the transistor made on silicon, allows single-electron
              sensitivity and operates with molecular spe-cies that are sub-10 nm in diameter
              when elongated. The second, a back fluid flow channel device, with a flow
              chan-nel
that is 5 nm (and larger) by 40-400 nm in cross-section and placed
              underneath a thin-silicon channel transistor, allows for sensitive measurements
              for molecules that are larger in size.
