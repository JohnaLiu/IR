Abstract    :
              This research involves a modeling study of climate variability in the tropical
              Atlantic sector. The working hypothesis is that climate variability over the
              Atlantic Ocean, and the surrounding land masses, is governed by an interaction
              between internal variability which couples the atmosphere to the ocean and
              external forcing from outside the tropical Atlantic region.  The first part of
              the work will address the specific impact that the remote effects of ENSO have
              on the tropical Atlantic region. The PIs intend to understand how the tropical
              Pacific forcing throughout the ENSO lifecycle impacts the precipitation, winds
              and sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic sector. This work will
              focus on coupled mechanisms by which the tropical Atlantic atmosphere and ocean
              interact to create climate variability. The PIs will examine how these
              mechanisms of internal coupling interact with the external forcing provided by
              ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation. The research will be undertaken using
              atmosphere, ocean, and coupled general circulation models. The work is
              important because it will increase our understanding of climate variability and
              predictability in the tropical Atlantic. This could have important societal
              benefits.
