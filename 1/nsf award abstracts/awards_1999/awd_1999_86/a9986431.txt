Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to produce a self-assembling diode from
              protein.
Demonstration of such a device would be an important first step to
              the development of a new class of biologically-based electronic components,
              ultimately designed to self-assemble into complex nanometer-scale
              devices.



Intermediate tasks toward the development of the first such
              device are proposed as follows. 1) Optimization of the surface residues of the
              metaloprotein pseudoazurin to improve crystallization properties. 2)
              Modification of the protein to covalently cross-link within the crystal to
              provide mechanical stability and to improve intermolecular conduction. 3)
              Characterization of electric conduction properties of the crystal. 4)
              Modification of those properties through addition of an additional metal
              center, chemical modification of the protein, or some combination of these two
              methods. 5) Growth of modified pseudoazurin protein crystals with optimized
              redox and conduction properties,
followed by growth of an additional layer of
              protein differing in those properties. 6) Characterization of the directional
              conduction through the resulting device.
