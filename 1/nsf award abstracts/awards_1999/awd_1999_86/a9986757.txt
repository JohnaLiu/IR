Award is for acquisition of a stable isotope ratio mass
              spectrometer (SIRMS) that will be dedicated to measuring oxygen and carbon
              isotopes of sediment carbonate samples, with a focus on measuring samples from
              Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) and other sediment cores that address
              paleoceanography and paleoclimate problems.  This instrument is needed to
              replace an obsolete, 14-year-old instrument that is limited in throughput and
              sample size requirements, and increasingly inadequate to support the needs of
              an active and growing (in both size and research directions) Earth Systems
              History group at Brown University.  The SIRMS unit to be acquired will likely
              be either a Finnegan MAT252 or a Micromass Optima, with the exact model to be
              determined later.  Either device would be fitted with an auomated sampling
              device for on-line preparation and analysis of CO2 derived from marine
              carbonate sediments.
