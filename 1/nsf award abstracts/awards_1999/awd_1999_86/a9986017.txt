Abstract    :
              Reversible protein phosphorylation is a fundamental regulatory mechanism in
              organisms ranging from prokaryotes to multicellular eukaryotes, and is involved
              in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes.  Protein phosphorylation
              is tightly regulated by several mechanisms that maintain a balance between the
              activities of phosphorylating and dephosphorylating enzymes.  The biological
              functions of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in Arabidopsis will be analyzed
              using mutations that will be isolated in the course of the project.  In
              transgenic plants, wild-type and dominant-defective PP2A-C subunits will be
              expressed under control of inducible promoters.  The effects of expressing
              these PP2A-C alleles will be analyzed both in a wild-type background and in a
              mutant, which exhibits reduced PP2A activity.  A dominant-defective approach
              will be combined with more conventional loss-of-function mutational analysis,
              through PCR-based screens to isolate T-DNA insertion mutations in two of the
              five known Arabidopsis  PP2A-C genes.  Plants carrying dominant-defective or
              null PP2A-C alleles will be examined for visible and conditional phenotypes,
              with particular attention to effects on seedling growth and development.  These
              experiments will investigate the effects of blocking PP2A functions, and will
              identify both specific and shared PP2A functions.  The goal of these studies is
              an improved understanding of the roles of PP2A subunits and their interactions
              in vivo.
