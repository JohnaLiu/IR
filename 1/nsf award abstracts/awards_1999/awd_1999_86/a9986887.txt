Proposal Title: Radioastronomical Studies of Plasmas
              from the Solar Corona to the Orbit of Earth

The investigators will employ
              radioastronomical observations to learn more about the solar corona and the
              solar wind within 0.28 astronomical units of the Sun, a region of space where
              direct measurements have never been made. The main effort is to use radio
              telescopes such as the Very Large Array and the Green Bank Telescope to observe
              distant, astronomical radio sources when they are occulted by the corona and
              the inner solar wind. Plasma characteristics of the corona and solar wind are
              inferred from distortions and modifications of the radio waves, a phenomenon
              generically known as interplanetary scintillation. Faraday rotation data will
              be used to construct and refine a model of the plasma density and magnetic
              field in the outer corona and inner solar wind. Observations will be supported
              by a program of theoretical research to develop models for plasma turbulence in
              this region of space. Effort will be concentrated on simplified theories of
              plasma turbulence, which nonetheless possess sufficient realism to explain the
              main observed features of the solar wind turbulence.
