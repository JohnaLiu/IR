Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop and quantify methods that employ
              differential cell adhesion to isolate cells, with the primary goal being to
              identify cell subpopulations based on the chemistry of their surface receptor. 
              Using three different surfaces (polyacrylamide gels, alkanethiols, or glass
              slides), micropatterned arrays of ligands will be made.  An arrayer will be
              used to make micropatterned surfaces.  The surfaces will be derivatized with
              antigens or avidin, which will allow the surface to capture cells bearing
              antibodies (RBL cells) or Biotin (KG1a cells).  The adhesion will be measured
              by optical videomicroscopy, and the yield and selectivity of the binding, as
              well as the rate constant of cell adhesion, will be measured as a function of
              cell 
surface molecular density, substrate ligand density, recognition
              kinetics and affinity, shear rate, and micropattern geometry.  Both model
              systems (to assess fundamental relationships) and a system of practical
              interest (the isolation of a stem cell line) will be explored.  These
              experiments will be modeled using a 
simulation algorithm that has the
              potential.
