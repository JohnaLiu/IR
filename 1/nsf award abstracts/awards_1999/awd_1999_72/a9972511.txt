Abstract    :
              We have implemented and adapted a cartography and visualization teaching
              laboratory curriculum at the Department of Geography modeled from the Virtual
              Geography Department at the University of Texas, Austin with exercises from
              Kenneth Foote's "The Geographer's Craft", and "Hands-On Human impacts on Land
              Use/Land Cover."  The Cultural Geography curriculum has been revised to include
              the CD-based program structure of Kuby, Harner, & Gober's Human Geography in
              Action.   The creation of this new lab implements the transition from the map
              as end-product to the map as a tool for data inquiry, including exploration,
              interpretation, and evaluation of data through the new cartography curriculum
              Geographic Visualization (GVIS).  Adapting this laboratory will further four
              goals of the department:  1) promote the transformation of the way that
              cartography is taught from manual to digital methods, and from the maps as
              end-product to the map as a tool for exploring geographical information
              visually; 2) transform the geography curriculum (including our geography
              teacher preparation curriculum) because it provides the necessary equipment to
              adapt existing online geography modules in mapping and design applications in a
              Windows NT network promoting faculty development; 3) encourage
              interdisciplinary collaboration on topics in mapping and visualization with
              departments outside of Geography; and 4) adapt and implement presentation modes
              for students preparing presentations for geography courses and student
              conferences.  This computer lab with teaching and visualization tools at
              Humboldt allows us to implement and incorporate online geography modules and
              desktop mapping exercises into coursework and encourages interaction with other
              departments where mapping is central to teaching.
