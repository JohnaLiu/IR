Abstract    :
              In 1994 the University of Florida Department of Chemistry established a new
              accelerated undergraduate course sequence, called Chemtrak, to provide an
              enhanced curriculum for 30-50 high caliber entering freshmen students.  These
              students typically enter with two or more years of high school chemistry and
              are highly motivated and prepared for more advanced material.  With a major
              instrumental emphasis, the syllabus of Chemtrak has evolved into a series of
              spectroscopic measurements involving emission, absorption and fluorescence of
              atoms and molecules.  Major instrumentation includes a variety of
              monochromators, spectrometers, lasers, burner assemblies, and optical
              components available in the department.

This project addresses the
              integration of computer-based spectrometers into the Chemtrak laboratory. The
              design of this laboratory is adapted from the work at Wake Forest University
              (NSF-DUE 9251294) where the modular approach of using computer-based
              spectrometry in the undergraduate curriculum has been proven successful in
              introducing spectrometric practice and theory to undergraduate students. In our
              adaptation of this work, five compact computer-based spectrometers with charge
              coupled device (CCD) detectors and laptop computers are integrated into the
              Chemtrak experimental curriculum. Students can observe the entire spectral
              region from 350-1000 nm and acquire large amounts of data for subsequent
              evaluation on their home computers. The added versatility of these small
              spectrometers permits more experiments to be completed, and more detailed and
              sophisticated measurements to be performed.  This is found to greatly enhance
              the educational impact of this course.
