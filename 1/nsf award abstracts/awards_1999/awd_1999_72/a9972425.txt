Abstract: We consider the
              asymptotic behavior of the geodesic flow and Laplace eigenvalues on manifolds
              of nonpositive curvature with an emphasis on aspects related to metric
              variation.  For example, the billiard ball flow of a rational polygon belongs
              to a natural moduli space of flows, and the system's periodic asymptotic
              behavior can be deduced from knowledge of the moduli space.  Although, the
              geodesic flow and the Laplace spectrum are known to be related via trace
              formulae, physicists have long believed in a more direct relationship provided
              by the `correspondence principle'.  This relationship will be considered in the
              context of the moduli space theory.

The objects under study are models for
              physical systems.  In particular, we consider here the asymptotic behavior of
              particles, both classical and quantum, under varying conditions. The systems we
              consider exhibit a high degree of chaotic behavior as is often the case in the
              real world.  Although these systems are simple abstractions, they represent a
              testing ground for further understanding of real world systems.  Eventual
              'downstream' applications could include high energy physics and cryptography.
