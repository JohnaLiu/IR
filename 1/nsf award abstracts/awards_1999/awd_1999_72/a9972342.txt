Abstract    :
              A graduate like approach is being adapted for upper division molecular biology
              students and a case oriented approach is being adapted at the introductory
              level.  Upper division students work with the Oregon Health Sciences University
              (OHSU) to design appropriate research projects to be conducted in the Concordia
              laboratories.  Specific components are included to enable pre-service teachers
              to adapt course offerings for the courses they will teach in the future.  A
              wide variety of laboratories and courses are affected.  The antecedents for the
              practices being adapted and implemented can be found in: Ahern-Rindell, 1998,
              J. of College Teaching 28, 159-165 and Keefer, 1998, J. of College Teaching 28,
              159-165 as regards the value and implementation guidelines for the
              incorporation of research into the undergraduate curriculum, and Herreid, 1997,
              J. of College Science Teaching 27, 92-94 and Smith, 1987 J. of Experimental
              Education 55, 149-154 as regards the use of case studies in the undergraduate
              classroom.
