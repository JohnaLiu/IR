Abstract    :
              This project develops educational materials, textbook, CD-ROM, and supporting
              documentation for accessible-design learning.  Accessible design conforms to
              standards of accessibility for persons with disabilities.  The learning modules
              supported by these products are to be integrated into existing
              engineering-design courses.  The product is applicable in engineering curricula
              as well as design organizations of industry.  The proof-of-concept includes
              prototype validation in a faculty-student setting as well as an
              industry-training environment.
