Abstract    :
              
A unique natural population of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster will be
              examined to elucidate the roles of a heat-shock protein (Hsp70), its encoding
              genes, and inducible high temperature tolerance in adaptation to natural
              temperature stress. First, natural variation will be described in the five
              Hsp70 genes in Drosophila inhabiting a marked thermal gradient in a small
              canyon. From this information, screens will be developed to assess hsp70
              genotypes in large numbers of flies, and these screens will be used to survey
              genetic variation at hsp70 loci throughout the canyon. Next, the corresponding
              magnitude of Hsp70 protein expression and level of inducible thermotolerance
              will be assessed in the genetic variants, and the relationships among these
              variables determined. Finally, these variables will be related to the climatic
              gradient within the canyon. By exploiting this ideal study system, the proposed
              research will document the action of natural selection on the sequence,
              expression, and phenotype of specific genes, and thus be among the first
              studies to simultaneously examine multiple components of adaptation.
