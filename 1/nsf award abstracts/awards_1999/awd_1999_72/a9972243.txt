TITLE:  Operating System and Middleware Support
              for a 
	Multi-media Systems Area Network

PI: Kamlesh Rath


Multi-media
              appliances are evolving around new serial systems area
network (SSAN)
              standards, e.g. FireWire (IEEE1394) and SerialExpress
(IEEE P3100). These
              provide the band-width needed for networking
multi-media appliances at a very
              low cost compared to current system-bus
and LAN technologies. Operating system
              enhancements for multi-media
appliances on high-bandwidth SSANs can enable
              sharing of processing,
storage and peripheral resources between
              appliances.

The operating system and middleware software in appliances on a
              SSAN
are required to perform the following functions: (i) manage the
              network
and peripheral interface hardware, (ii) provide dynamic
              transaction
based device registration and resource management mechanisms
              for
hot-pluggable devices, (iii) provide automatic buffer management based
on
              application and multi-media data/stream requirements, (iv) provide
one-copy
              user to network interface data transfer mechanism for real-time
data, and (v)
              provide mechanisms for integrated presentation of related
media streams on a
              client.

This research focuses on analysis, design and development of
              dynamic
resource management software for multi-media appliances and
              transport
layer software for SSANs. The operating system enhancements
              and
middleware are being developed on a light-weight real-time kernel using
a
              minimal POSIX compliant sub-set for portability.
