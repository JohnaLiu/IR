Abstract    :
              A chemistry/physics laser laboratory is under development.  Included in this
              laboratory are a nitrogen pumped dye laser, a monochromator, a digital storage
              oscilloscope, a photodetection system, and a gated integrator. Laboratory
              experiences for the undergraduate physics and chemistry curricula support
              courses from introductory physics to advanced optics in physics and in
              chemistry, courses from instrumental analysis to computational chemistry. 
              Through inquiry-based learning, students will explore laser technology
              applications in their field of study.  Typical  activities include the
              examination of excited state lifetimes, phosphorescence, inelastic scattering,
              and selection rules for one and two photon spectroscopy.  Planned laboratory
              experiments are adaptations of those presented at two NSF workshops: "Advanced
              Undergraduate Experiments Using Lasers" and "Recent Advances in Physical
              Chemistry".
