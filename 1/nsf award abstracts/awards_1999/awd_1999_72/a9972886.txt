Drs. Zebker and Tyler will
              use radar observations to study the structure in the icy surfaces of the
              Galilean satellites of Jupiter.  Improvements to both Arecibo and the NASA
              Goldstone Solar System Radar will provide higher resolution images than
              previously available and allow improved constraints on the subsurface structure
              within the crust.  Modeling of coherent backscatter will permit the
              determination of the spatial and depth distributions of cracks, bubbles, and
              inclusions within the lithosphere and constrain models of the surface evolution
              of the moons.
