Abstract    :
              This proof of concept project demonstrates that one can develop a research
              based, problem-solving guidebook for students in a calculus based introductory
              physics course that is acceptable to faculty teaching the course. The project 
              builds on the existing research on the differences between expert and novice
              problem solving.  To accomplish our goal to develop a prototype of educational
              materials for students,  we incorporate information relating to: (1) the
              beliefs of a sample of faculty about student problem solving and (2) the
              difficulty students have solving problems posed by the faculty on examinations.
               The entire project is under the guidance of part of the University of
              Minnesota Physics Education Group with the collaboration of University of
              Minnesota faculty members in physics.   Building on our extensive work with
              cooperative group problem solving pedagogy, the project outcomes are: (1) a
              prototype student problem solving guidebook for the mechanics component of an
              introductory calculus based physics course; (2) a plan for the complete
              development of a comprehensive problem solving guidebook for students and an
              accompanying faculty guide, tested at diverse sites and revised.  The prototype
              student problem solving guide is available through McGraw-Hill either from our
              web site (http://www.physics.umn.edu/groups/physed/) , in our workshops, or
              directly from the publisher.
