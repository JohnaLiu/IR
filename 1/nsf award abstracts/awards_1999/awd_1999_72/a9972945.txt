	This project involves the ethnographic fieldwork of
              anthropologists from the University of Texas studying the experience of poverty
              in the border region between Texas and Mexico.  Two senior anthropologists, a
              post-doctoral and a graduate student researcher will draw a sample of 20
              households in each of two neighborhoods in each of four cities, the regional
              centers of San Antonio Texas and Monterrey, Nuevo Leon and the border cities of
              Brownesville and Matamoros.  Scales representing economic hardship will be
              developed and compared for each place, and detailed economic information about
              income and expenditures will be developed for each household.  The researchers
              will study transborder processes of work and social activity, and assess the
              impact of the US welfare system reforms in light of the experience of Mexican
              families who never were involved with a comparable welfare system. The project
              will compare the poverty situation in each country taking into account the
              differing cultural expectations and resources available to households.  The
              resulting information will be of great value to local planners as well as to
              scholars studying comparable border situations in other regions and
              countries.
