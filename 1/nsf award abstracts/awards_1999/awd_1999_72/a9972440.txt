ABSTRACT:
The proposed research concerns methodology
              for accurate inference based
on likelihoods. Inference about a scalar
              parameter of interest in the
presence of nuisance parameters can be achieved
              by using the signed root
of the likelihood ratio statistic, which has the
              standard normal
distribution asymptotically. In situations where the number of
              nuisance
parameters is large or the sample size is small, the standard
              normal
approximation to the distribution of the signed root can be
              inaccurate.
Considerable progress has been made recently in understanding
              the
statistical properties of the signed root and in constructing
              analytical
modifications to the signed root that improve the accuracy of the
              normal
approximation. Unfortunately, the modifications can be challenging
              to
implement routinely, because they require elusive constructs, such
              as
ancillary statistics, or they involve complicated analytical
calculations,
              such as taking expectations of higher-order derivatives of
the log likelihood
              function. In contrast to the use of analytical
modifications, the proposed
              research focuses on the development of
simulation methods to refine
              distributional approximations. These
parametric-bootstrap techniques are
              attractive for their conceptual
simplicity and very broad applicability.
              However, for the simulation
methods to be valid, they must offer the same
              desirable attributes that
the analytical modifications possess, with regard to
              such key statistical
concepts as ancillarity and large-deviation behavior. A
              crucial component
of the proposed research is to assess the statistical
              qualities of the
simulation methods, particularly compared to those of the
              analytical
modifications.  Other aspects of the proposed research involve
              extending
the simulation methods to models where standard asymptotic
              behavior
fails, such as models involving random effects, and to
              circumstances
where genuine likelihoods are unavailable but pseudo-likelihoods
              can be
devised.
