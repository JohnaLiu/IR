This project will 1) provide a latitudinal and longitudinal
              inventory of Beringian mammals and associated parasites; 2) develop a database
              to asses regional and inter-hemispheric diversity and biogeography; 3) provide
              material to address the conservation, systematics, and evolution of selected
              mammalian hosts and their associated parasites (e.g., epidemiologists).  This
              information will stimulate the interpretation of past (and prediction of
              future) impacts of climate change on this component of biotic diversity.  By
              including a major emphasis on parasites, questions related to the extent and
              timing of host-parasite cospeciation as influenced by the repeated inundation
              of the Bering Land Bridge and separation of the Beringian fauna from other
              continental faunas (e.g. endemism) can be explored.
