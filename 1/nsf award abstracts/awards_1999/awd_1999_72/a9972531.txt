     This award will provide partial support for speakers
              and others at
the 1999 Greater Boston Logic Conference, held at M.I.T., May
              14-16, 1999.
These conferences normally occur on a biennial basis, alternating
              with the
UCLA logic meetings that occur in even-numbered years.  They have
              provided
an opportunity for mathematical logicians from around the world to
              present
the most current results in the field to an appreciative audience of
              their
peers and have been held at M.I.T. every other year for more than a
              decade.
A prominent feature of these conferences has been the high level
              of
participation by students and young postdocs, including women and
              minorities,
and this is again the case for the current year.  Attendance is
              estimated
at one hundred, primarily from the United States, with some
              representation
from Europe.
