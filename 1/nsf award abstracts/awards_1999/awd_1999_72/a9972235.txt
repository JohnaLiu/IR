In a
              mobile ad hoc network, nodes communicate solely via a wireless
medium, without
              any infrastructure such as base stations.  The
topology graph of such a
              network connects two nodes that are within
each other's communication range. 
              The topology can change whenever a
node moves.  Such networks are useful for
              disaster recovery,
search-and-rescue in remote areas, and military operations.
               The
proposed research will develop efficient distributed primitives
              for
mobile ad hoc networks, to perform mutual exclusion, group
communication,
              and leader election.  Existing algorithms for these
problems do not take into
              account all characteristics of ad hoc
networks, such as highly dynamic
              topology, constraints on energy
consumption, and variable transmission error
              rates.  The proposed
research will involve characterization of appropriate
              performance
metrics for evaluating algorithms on ad hoc networks, such as
              energy
consumption and impact of node mobility; design of
              efficient
distributed algorithms for mutual exclusion, leader election,
              and
group communication; performance evaluation of distributed algorithms
for
              ad hoc networks, based on simulations and analytical
              techniques;
proof-of-concept prototype implementation of a distributed
              blackboard
on a small ad hoc network consisting of wireless laptops.
