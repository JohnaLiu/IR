This proposal requests support for an experimental program to
              study the decay of B mesons.  The data will be taken with the CLEO III detector
              at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) collider.  This group contributed
              to the R&D needed to upgrade the CLEO II detector and to the construction of
              the new central drift chamber.  Current physics analyses using CLEO II data
              include (a) B meson decays which proceed through both tree and penguin diagrams
              and thus may violate CP symmetry, e.g. B  K* r, and (b) hadronic modes for b  u
              quark decays or B  D_s n(p) where the D_s meson comes from the materialization
              of a virtual W boson.  The group proposed the following three new physics
              analysis topics: (c) A search for a third generation Goldstone boson that is
              the result of a spontaneously broken symmetry, (d) An inclusive study of B
              decays to D_s and D*_s with special attention to the endpoint of the spectrum
              which can yield information on b  u decay, and (e) Search for the
              semi-inclusive decay B  f X_s, which is a pure penguin diagram
              process.
