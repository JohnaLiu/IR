Abstract    :
              9972257
Laver
     Steel and Laver proved from a very large cardinal, a
              theorem about
a tower of finite left-distributive ( a(bc) = (ab)(ac) )
              algebras.
Laver is studying a family of other finite problems about l.d.
              algebras
and the braid groups, using large cardinal axioms.  He proved
              a
partial solution to the strong Halpern-Lauchli problem on binary
trees,
              under the assumption of a measurable cardinal, and is working
on solving the
              full problem.  In all the above problems it is not
known whether a large
              cardinal is needed.  The project also involves
studying a very large cardinal
              axiom of Woodin that behaves like the
axiom of determinacy on higher
              cardinality versions of the real line.
This axiom is being studied for its own
              interest and for the
possibility of variants of it shedding some light on the
              continuum
hypothesis.  The CH is known to be immune to standard large
              cardinal
axioms, but not necessarily to strong variants.
     Almost all
              theorems in mathematics can be proved from a simple
set of basic principles,
              the Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZFC) axioms for sets.
But, as first discovered by Goedel
              im the 1930's, there are some
statements that can neither be proved nor
              disproved from ZFC.
However, at least for some of these ``undecidable''
              statements there
is hope of their resolution.  Namely, they might be proved
              when one
augments ZFC by ``large cardinal'' axioms, axioms beyond the
              strength
of ZFC, which assert the existence of very large infinite
              numbers.
The undecidable statements are in some cases about finite
              mathematics.
The project involves studying some large cardinal axioms and
              their
potential to solve some well studied open questions in classical
              math.
Since some of these problems are about the finite world, they cannot
be
              ruled out as sources of concrete applications; if this happens, an
area of
              high philosophical interest will also have a striking
practical use.
