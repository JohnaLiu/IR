Abstract    :
              This proof-of-concept EMD project is developing case studies and teaching
              materials to be used by computer science professors to integrate ethics and
              social impact issues into traditional computer science courses.  The project
              builds upon the recommendations of ACM/IEEE Curricula 91 and the NSF-funded
              ImpactCS project, which provided the learning objectives and implementation
              guidelines for integrating ethics and social impact across the computer science
              curriculum. 

A Social Impact Analysis (SIA) Toolkit and two historical case
              studies are being developed as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the efficacy
              of the case study approach to teaching these issues.  These materials are being
              field-tested at the Pi's home institution and three other institutions.  The
              prototype materials are being presented to publishers for future hard-copy
              dissemination in the form of a textbook of case studies, lesson plans, and
              homework activities for students.

Outcomes of the project include a
              prototype website containing the materials, papers presenting the evaluation
              data from the four test sites given at conferences , and the presentation of
              workshops at national conferences as a preliminary dissemination strategy.
