Abstract    :
              This grant will fund the development and construction of specialized operational
              test and calibration sources for liquid scintillation detectors, as well as
              monitoring methods for scintillator properties at several meter pathlengths. 
              The requirements are geared to match those of large scintillator based neutrino
              detectors where radiopurity and security against contamination are of paramount
              importance.

Particular focus is given to developing aspects of a calibration
              and monitoring scheme for the Borexino solar neutrino detector, whose principle
              purpose is to measure the solar Be-7 neutrino flux.  The primary avenue being
              pursued is an internal, encapsulated, radioactive source. The program is
              integrated with other calibration efforts of the Borexino collaboration.
