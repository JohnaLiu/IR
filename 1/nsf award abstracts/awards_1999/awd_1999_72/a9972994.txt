Herringbone calcite, a distinctive calcite cement with
              macroscopic banding and specific crystallographic properties, may derive its
              distinctive morphology from the presence of Fe2+ or Mn2+ in the precipitating
              solution.  Extremely well preserved herringbone calcite present in fissures and
              caves in a Middle Eocene carbonate platform, Egypt, will provide the
              opportunity to test previously proposed models for herringbone calcite
              precipitation based on Archean marine occurrences.  If the conditions promoting
              herringbone calcite precipitation can be constrained, a better understanding of
              ancient ocean chemistry can be developed, and results will lead to insights
              into the fundamental processes controlling calcite crystal morphology.  Thus,
              the research objectives for this project are to morphologically and
              geochemically characterize the Egyptian herringbone
calcite, and to use the
              results to constrain conditions promoting development of the herringbone
              calcite crystal texture.
