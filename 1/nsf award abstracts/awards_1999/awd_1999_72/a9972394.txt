Abstract    :
              This project addresses the current education of engineers in the subjects of
              applied mechanics and materials science. Although these two fields are 
              increasingly linked in the research and industrial communities, this trend has
              not filtered down to the engineering curriculum in most universities. Applied
              mechanics and materials science are often taught by different departments, each
              with vastly different goals, focus, and language; direct relationships between
              these intrinsically connected subjects are infrequently included in course
              material.

This project links these disciplines in the engineering curriculum
              through 1.  a model for integrating currently disparate courses in the typical
              undergraduate engineering curriculum, building on successful preliminary
              results; 2.  courseware for use in engineering courses that takes advantage of
              recent innovations in scientific research and instructional technology; 3. 
              foundation basis for developing, at a future time, graduate curricula that
              based on the integration and synthesis of mechanics and materials; and 4. use
              of the Internet, interactive media, and workshops to bring the two communities
              in instructional academe together in content and effective learning
              methodologies.
