Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department at Macalester College is upgrading a high field NMR
              spectrometer for the purpose of interfacing the instrument to the campus
              network. The goal of this upgrade is to permit students to remotely process
              data from their undergraduate laboratory experiments. The instrument is a
              Gemini 300B 300MHz NMR spectrometer (NSF-ILI grant) and is used in
              student-faculty research effort and in several of undergraduate courses. 

In
              order to promote curricular change, gains from NSF supported projects (NSF-CHE
              8620242 and NSF-USE 9153106) have been adapted in our sophomore level organic
              labs and upper level chemistry labs. Organic chemistry students now have
              greater access to data acquisition and analysis. Upper level adaptations
              include the use of Fuson's curriculum (NSF-USE-9152169) for studying FT NMR in
              our Instrumental Analysis course, which places primary emphasis on activities
              and investigations on the nature of the NMR experiment.  Our Advanced Organic
              Chemistry course provides a suitable backdrop for the introduction of a variety
              of workhorse 2D NMR techniques to our curriculum.  NMR analysis, on combination
              with our recently acquired molecular modeling capability, spawns open-ended
              student laboratory projects for the determination of structure and conformation
              of interesting molecules. Additionally, the works appearing in J. Chem. Ed
              papers of Mills(1996), Midland (1994), and Lee (1996) are adapted with the goal
              of developing new pedagogically interesting examples.  In this venue students
              learn to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules with
              two-dimensional experiments and to study exchange phenomena and the dynamics of
              molecular interactions.
