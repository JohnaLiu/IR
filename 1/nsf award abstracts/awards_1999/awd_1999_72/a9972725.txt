The ecological constraints hypothesis proposes that
              competition and/or habitat saturation promotes the evolution of polygyny
              (multiple queens) in colonies of eusocial insects that have low relatedness
              between nest mates.  To test this hypothesis, this study will compare colonies
              from three field populations of the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile: an
              introduced population with no competition, an introduced population coexisting
              with a major competitor, and a native population.  Ecological data including
              nest characteristics and density of nests will be measured in the field, and
              the genetic variables of queen number and reproductive skew will be measured
              using microsatellite analysis.  Comparing data from the three populations will
              reveal how the ecology, social structure, and degree of polygyny of this
              species changes with different levels of ecological constraint. 

The results
              of this study will expand our traditional view of the evolution of cooperation
              as a process of kin selection by exploring how cooperation can evolve between
              distantly related individuals.  Determining how an important life history trait
              like polygyny varies with ecological factors is the first step to understanding
              the many ways social organisms may be able to adapt to their environment.  The
              significance of this study reaches beyond the scope of eusocial insects.  By
              relating demographic features with internal properties of societies, this study
              tests the underlying forces behind the proximate and ultimate causes of a
              number of evolutionary puzzles including kin conflict in complex societies,
              reproductive skew, communal breeding, and the evolution of social life itself.
