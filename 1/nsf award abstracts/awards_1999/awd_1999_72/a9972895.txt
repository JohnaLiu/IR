              Infrastructure: A Platform for Wide Area Distributed Systems, Networking, and
              Applications Research

Researchers at the University of Washington will
              develop a small-scale prototype of a platform for conducting wide area
              distributed systems and networking experiments.  The platform will consist of
              approximately six physically distributed sites.  Each site will have a rack of
              four PCs to run distributed experiments; these can be loaded with experimental
              operating systems or applications programs. One of the machines will serve as a
              remote system management node to provide authentication, resource management,
              and termination of runaway experiments.   The nodes will be connected by
              UCAID's Abilene Internet2.  This facility will prototype the capability for
              researchers across the country to access this unique experimental facility.
              This platform will be the basis for developing a proposal for a larger platform
              with additional nodes to support research in distributed systems and
              applications.
