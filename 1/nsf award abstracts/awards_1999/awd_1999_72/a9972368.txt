Dependability
              Components for Distributed and Network Systems

Project
              Summary


Motivated by the need for and the opportunities in assuring
              dependability in distributed and network systems, this work investigates the
              use of components whose essential task is 
to satisfy dependability
              properties. These `dependability components' are being shown to be useful, not
              only in systems that are `black-box' (only the interface information is
              
available) or `white-box' (the specification and implementation information
              is available as well), but especially in systems that are `gray-box' (the
              implementation information is lacking).  
Also, methods are being created that
              deal with refinement of systems while preserving dependability properties, that
              add dependability components for achieving system security, and 
that
              automatically synthesize component-based dependable systems. The research aims
              at impacting the scalability of dependable systems.
