Although the theoretical
              importance of parasites on host population dynamics has been well established,
              most models ignore the dynamics of a parasite infections within a host.  The
              importance of parasite population dynamics within a host is generally not
              understood.  This project builds on a basic model of within-host parasite
              population dynamics to evaluate different modes of parasite transmission. The
              very nature of most parasitic infections makes empirical ecological studies of
              host-parasite interactions difficult.  This project links tests of these
              theoretical approaches with a carefully chosen empirical system.  This overall
              approach will lead to an understanding of the role that within-host parasite
              population dynamics play in natural populations.
