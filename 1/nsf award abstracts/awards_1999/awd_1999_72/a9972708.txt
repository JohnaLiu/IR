R-genes in plants determine whether individuals are
              resistant or susceptible to particular strains of disease causing pathogens.
              R-genes tend to be quite variable in natural plant populations, yet the forces
              maintaining this genetic variation are not well understood. One hypothesis is
              that susceptible plants produce more seed than resistant plants under certain
              environmental conditions. In this way, resistance is not always favored and
              both phenotypes are maintained. The experiments detailed in this research test
              the hypothesis that the energetic cost of having a resistance response to a
              pathogen is greater than the benefit the plant receives from stopping pathogen
              growth under some circumstances. If R-gene resistance responses are costly,
              then the level of resistance response may determine whether a resistance
              response has a net benefit or cost. 

In addition, this project will
              investigate whether different levels of resistance response have different
              benefits and costs for the plants. Arabidopsis thaliana infected in the
              greenhouse with its natural pathogen, downy mildew, will be investigated. 
              Plants that differ by the presence/absence of an R-gene but are otherwise
              genetically identical will be compared. In combination with theoretical
              investigations, these experiments will explore whether the level of R-gene
              mediated resistance is an important factor in the coevolutionary interactions
              between A.thaliana and downy mildew.

These experiments will provide
              fundamental knowledge about plant-pathogen coevolutionary interactions. 
              Knowledge about these interactions in natural populations will improve the
              application of pathogen resistance in agricultural plant species.
