     The investigator continues work on the applications
              of
nonlinear dynamics to cell biology and physiology with particular
emphasis
              in neurophysiology.  Specifically, the following problems
are studied: 1. 
              Analysis of synaptic bistability; what is the
dynamic mechanism by which two
              (and more) mutually coupled
neurons can maintain activity in absence of
              inputs?  2.  How does
adaptation enhance the synchronization of excitatorily
              coupled
neural oscillators?  3.  What determines the form and properties
of
              ``lurching'' waves that arise in systems of neurons that are
coupled with
              delays as well as in models of thalamic
oscillations?  4.  What is the effect
              of inhibition and slow
excitatory synapses on the propagation of waves in
              cortical
slices?  5.  How are free and bound actin spatially distributed
in
              the cell; is there any nontrivial spatial dependence on the
length
              distribution of the polymerized molecule?
     The investigator studies how
              mathematical methods can be
used to understand how biological systems work. 
              Specifically, he
is interested in how nerve cells interact with each other
              to
produce activity that is related to behavior.  For example, when a
person
              or animal holds something in short-term memory (like a
phone number) how does
              the relevant group of neurons stay on and
what turns it off?  Mathematical
              models are created and
mathematical techniques are used to study these models
              in order
to suggest new experiments.  During normal and abnormal
              behavior
parts of the nervous system are capable of producing waves that
move
              across regions of the brain.  The investigator is interested
in what factors
              determine the properties of these waves, such as
their speed and shape. 
              Finally, he studies models of the
components inside the cell that are
              responsible for the cell's
shape and how it moves around.
