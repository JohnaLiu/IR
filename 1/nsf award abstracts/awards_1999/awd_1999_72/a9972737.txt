Populations of endangered species are of special concern
              because they typically persist as small populations. Small population size
              heightens the probability of extinction. In addition, theoretical studies
              indicate that small populations accumulate deleterious mutations because
              genetic drift overwhelms the purifying effects of selection, a phenomenon that
              further increases the likelihood of extinction. 

The investigators will
              conduct theoretical studies of genetic drift to determine the accumulation of
              deleterious mutations in populations. Populations of pupfishes in the deserts
              of western Nevada provide an excellent system to test whether extremely small
              populations accumulate significantly more mutations than larger populations.
              One of the populations, that of the Devil's Hole pupfish, has the unfortunate
              distinction of being the smallest vertebrate population. For a series of
              populations of different size, the rates and patterns of mutation accumulation
              will be assessed by comparative analysis of DNA sequences for several
              mitochondrial genes to test the predictions of the theoretical models.

By
              documenting genetic effects of small population size, conservation biologists
              will gain insights into how small populations evolve. Information about the
              relationship between population size and mutation accumulation will advance
              understanding about the influence of evolutionary forces in extinction.
