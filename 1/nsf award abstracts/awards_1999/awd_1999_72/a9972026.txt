The project will improve existing knowledge of land snail
              and slug distributions on the Delmarva (Delaware-Maryland-Virginia) peninsula
              by (1) mapping in 5 km squares giving 64 times more resolution than existing
              maps; (2) documenting locality records; (3) making more collections; and (4)
              documenting introduced species.  The survey will aid workers in the
              conservation, agriculture, and ecology fields.  Collaborating with conservation
              organizations will help them manage rare species.  The project will educate the
              public by involving students, and by disseminating information through museum
              exhibits, on the World Wide Web, and in print.  Expected results include an
              identification guide and atlas showing detailed distributions of Delmarva snail
              and slug species, hundreds of new locality records, and an increase from 100 to
              130 species known from this region including five species new to science.
