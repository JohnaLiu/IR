              Capture, Interpretation and Access

Georgia Tech researchers will perform
              research on systems and application level issues arising from two applications,
              a virtual classroom and perceptual information spaces.  The PI's will perform
              research addressing capture, interpretation, access and delivery of multiple
              media streams.  At the application level, research will address deducing users
              expressions (e.g. focus of interest) and emotions; scaling issues to the campus
              wide level will be explored for the virtual classroom, and the equipment will
              support a research on perceptual processing.  Systems level research will
              examine QoS methods, shared state, metadata, and storage architecture for
              multimedia lectures and other objects.  Middleware and runtime systems will be
              developed for inter-cluster and client server computing as well as to handle
              media streams in a heterogeneous environment.
