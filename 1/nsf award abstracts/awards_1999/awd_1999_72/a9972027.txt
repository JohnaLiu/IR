An intensive inventory of the macrofungi (ie., mushrooms,
              boletes, puffballs, bracket fungi, etc.) of Costa Rica is proposed to document
              the diveristy of noetropical macrofungi.  Preliminary surveys in other areas of
              the country indicate than many undescribed taxa await discovery and that our
              knowledge of Costa Rican macrofungi remains incomplete.  This inventory is
              focusing on six conservation areas:  Guanacaste, Arenal, Amistad Caribe,
              Amistad Pacifico, Tempisque, and Osa.  These data will be integrated into
              datasets being compiled by the investigators and their students, and
              disseminated on the web.  This project will continue training of students and
              parataxonomists in collecting and documenting macrofungi diversity, plus the
              publication of the resulting database and on-line interactive indentification
              system.
