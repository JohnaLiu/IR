This award supports a total of 21 science and engineering
              students as research interns to China over a three-year period beginning in the
              summer and fall of 1999.  The students will participate in collaborative
              projects with Chinese researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
              (MIT) counterpart institutions in Beijing and Shanghai.  Students will be sent
              under the auspices of the MIT International Science and Technology Initiative
              (MISTI).  NSF funding enables MISTI to expand the number and rage of research
              interns.  This support provides an opportunity for promising junior scientists
              and technologists on a research career trajectory to gain exposure to rapidly
              expanding research communities in China.
