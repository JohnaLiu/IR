The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE)
              proposes to continue the ASEE-NSF Visiting Scholars Program, which supports
              visits by highly respected educators to selected engineering colleges.  These
              educators will conduct pairs of two-day regional workshops at up to 10
              engineering schools during a one-year period.  One of the primary goals of the
              program will be to identify some of the most promising new innovations in
              engineering education that have resulted from NSF-supported research and
              transfer this information broadly into the engineering education community. 
              The intent of this activity is to enhance the quality of engineering education
              by conducting faculty workshops which will impart a better understanding of the
              current innovations in teaching and learning methods, curricular content,
              collaborative learning, and assessment outcomes.  Through its network of
              engineering deans and department heads, ASEE will identify schools who will
              host these workshops.  ASEE will produce a brochure about the workshops and
              promote these workshops throughout its nationwide membership.  ASEE will work
              with each host institution to promote the workshops to other nearby
              institutions.  In addition to the institutional visits, ASEE proposes to
              organize a two day national conference which will feature new and innovative
              teaching and earning approaches that have resulted from NSF-supported research
              and provide engineering educators with information and the tools needed to
              enhance their teaching and research.
