Abstract    :
              
The ordered semantic hyper-linking strategy (OSHL) combines propositional
              efficiency, semantics, and equality in one integrated automatic theorem prover
              for first-order logic.  Semantics refers to the meaning of symbols, and
              propositional efficiency refers to efficiency on problems requiring significant
              case analysis.  Few existing provers utilize semantics, and most are not
              propositionally efficient.  The current Prolog implementation will be extended
              in ways that were suggested by a recent paper on the topic.  The prover will
              also be re-implemented in Scheme for greater speed.  In addition, a prover
              combining equality, unification, and propositional efficiency but no semantics
              will be implemented, because semantics may not always be available.  These
              combinations should outperform almost all other provers on a significant class
              of problems.  Techniques capable of effective theorem proving on sets of
              millions of input clauses will also be sought.
