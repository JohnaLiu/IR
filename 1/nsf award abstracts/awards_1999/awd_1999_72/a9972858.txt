Abstract    :
              The award supplements a half salary sabbatical for J. R. Quine to spend a year
              at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, Florida.
               He will immerse himself in the scientific
environment of the laboratory to
              get a better knowledge of the experimental side of the research and will supply
              mathematical expertise in a collaboration with Timothy Cross, Director of
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), on the determination of protein structure
              using solid-state NMR.  The year at NHMFL will provide Quine the opportunity to
              study first hand the theory and experimental techniques of scientific
              disciplines which are not his expertise ... NMR, crystallography, quantum
              mechanics, protein structure.  This will enhance communication between 
              mathematics and the other sciences in the Institute for Molecular Biophysics
              (IMB) at FSU and the NHMFL.  Quine will supervise a mathematics graduate
              student funded on a NSF Research Training Grant through IMB who is writing a
              dissertation on this application of mathematics and working at NHMFL,  and will
              assist other mathematics and IMB students working at NHMFL.  He will develop
              course materials to explain the mathematical questions of concern to the bench
              scientists at NHMFL to mathematics and other IMB students.  The NHMFL provides
              a multidisciplinary environment for researchers,
where many areas of expertise
              are required to reach the scientific goal of structure determination using
              magnetic resonance.   This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office
              of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical
              Sciences (DMS).
