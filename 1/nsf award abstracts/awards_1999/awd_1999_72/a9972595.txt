Fires play an integral role in the vegetation and climate
              dynamics of the boreal forest and contribute significantly to the amount of
              aerosols and gases in the atmosphere both today and in the past. An
              understanding of the interaction between long-term climate changes and fire
              regime is critical to our understanding of how future fire dynamics will be
              effected by climate and vegetation. In order to understand how fire dynamics
              will be affected by future climate change and vegetation changes, it is
              imperative to determine how past climate and vegetation shifts have changed
              past fire regimes. This dissertation research focuses on the prevalence of fire
              in different climate regions and during past climate changes in Western Canada
              and Alaska, in order to determine sensitivity of fire regimes to climate
              changes. The research will reconstruct fossilized charcoal and pollen records
              across modern climate moisture gradients and past climate and vegetation
              changes. This will allow assessment of the importance of fire under these
              different climate and vegetation conditions.
