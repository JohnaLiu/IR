Abstract    :
              This doctoral dissertation research examines the distinct patterns of global
              integration of "second cities" as opposed to global cities, and assesses the
              impact of these integrative patterns on local, second city politics. Recent
              research on globalization and cities assumes rather than demonstrates that
              globalization is a new, historically unique phenomenon which forces unwelcome
              political choices on cities. It also focuses too much on top-tier financial
              metropolises, like New York and London. The researcher will conduct comparative
              case studies of international networks and of local political culture in two
              second cities, Philadelphia (US) and Manchester (UK)-arguably the most
              prominent industrial cities in each country. Each city will be examined in two
              periods, 1880-1910 and 1970-2000. Data sources will include directories of
              corporate ownership, newspapers, records of public and non-profit agencies, and
              interviews with public officials and immigrant leaders. From these, the
              researcher will construct databases of economic and political activity, and
              narratives of shifts in local politics. Results from each city will be compared
              against each other, and also compared as a group with existing literature on
              global cities. The dissertation will contribute to an improved understanding of
              globalization in three ways. Empirically, it extends the literature on
              globalization and cities by considering second cities and their global
              interurban networks. Theoretically, the dissertation combines political
              economic with cultural approaches to globalization. Practically, the study
              advances understanding of globalization's impacts on local politics and notions
              of social membership.
