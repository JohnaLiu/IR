Abstract    :
              
In most species of animals there is a fairly constant relationship in the
              relative sizes of body parts for all individuals.  In some species, however, it
              is the normal condition that some fraction of individuals is disproportionately
              shaped when compared to others in the same species.   These differences in the
              size, and also shape, of body parts occurs in a wide variety of organisms and
              could be controlled by genetic, developmental or ecological factors.   This
              research will examine the importance of such factors in the rapid evolution of
              body shape in the beetle Onthophagus taurus.   Male O. taurus that exceed a
              critical body size develop a pair of spectacular horns on their heads, while
              those smaller than this threshold remain hornless.  Several recently
              established O. taurus populations have diverged dramatically in this critical
              threshold body size.  This project combines ecological and morpholgical
              approaches with studies on the developmental mechanisms that control growth and
              proportionality of body parts. 

Evolutionary changes of mechanisms
              controlling development may play a pivotal role in speciation and the origin of
              biodiversity.   This project will provide important insights into how
              environmental conditions can foster modifications of developmental control
              mechanisms in natural populations.   Such knowledge is crucial for evaluating
              the role of developmental processes in the origin of morphological diversity.
