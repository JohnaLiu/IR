It is well known that the Earth undergoes oscillations
              after large earthquakes.  Recent studies show that the Earth is oscillating
              continuously, even when earthquakes are not occurring--fundamental spheroidal
              modes between 2 and 7 mHz appear to be constantly excited irrespective of
              earthquake occurrence.  The goal of this study is to understand this phenomenon
              and delineate its cause through the use of gravimeter data, broadband
              seismometer data, and barometer data.  Temporal and spatial variations of these
              oscillations will be analysed and their behaviors will be characterized and
              documented.  Possible causes include 1) cumulative effects of small
              earthquakes, 2) atmospheric effects, and 3) slow/silent earthquakes. 
              Preliminary analyses indicates that the first cause cannot produce the signals
              unless a well known seismological relation (the Gutenberg-Richter
              magnitude-frequency relation) is violated, which is not likely.  Therefore,
              this study will focus on the latter two hypotheses, namely atmospheric
              excitation and slow/silent earthquakes.
