This grant is to support the travel expenses of invited
              speakers to a special session on Wireless Technology.  This special session
              will be held in conduction with the 1999 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society
              International Symposium, in Orlando, FL.  About 1000 people attend this meeting
              annually.  Although there will be 10 presentations in this special session, the
              PI requested funds for only five speakers who work in research areas different
              form those normally discussed in this IEEE APS meeting.
