This proposal requests support for a group at Embry-Riddle
              Aeronautical University to work on the mini-BooNE neutrino oscillation search
              experiment at Fermilab.  The question of whether or not neutrinos have mass has
              been long-standing in particle physics, with profound implications for the
              Standard Model of particles and forces and for Cosmology.  Recently, the LSND
              experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Superkamiokande experiment
              in Japan have produced intriguing results with varying degrees of evidence for
              neutrino oscillations.  The existence of neutrino oscillations implies the
              existence of neutrino mass.
