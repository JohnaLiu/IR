This project is designed to inventory the macrofungi of
              Costa Rica, and to document the diversity of neotropical macrofunti to further
              understanding of their biology.  The planned survey of macrofungi will be done
              as part of the National Inventory of Costa Rican Biodiversity being coordinated
              by the Costa Rican Sustainable Biodiversity Development Initiative.  Coninued
              training of students and parataxonomists in techniques of collecting and
              documenting macrofungi diveristy, plus the publication of the resulting
              specimen database and an on-line interactive identification system should make
              further studies of macrofungi sustainable by incountry specialists.  Because
              the macrofungi of most areas of Costa Rica outside of the oadk-dominated
              forests of the central and southern mountain regions have not been inventoried,
              this projec will uncover many taxa previously unknonwn to science.  These data
              will significantly add to knowledge of neotropical mycology and will be
              availabelfor susequent studies on the ecology and systematics.
