The emissions of dust sized mineral particles (<50 micron
              diameter) from susceptible surfaces such as playas, alluvial fans, and washes
              in arid and semi-arid environments remains poorly understood.  Under certain
              wind conditions these surfaces provide a significant source of particulates
              that can result in high background atmospheric dust loadings, or in some cases,
              major dust storms. Dust can be entrained by the shearing force of the wind and
              also ejected from the surface into the air stream by the ballistic impact of
              sand grains moving in saltation.  Models that consider only saltation
              bombardment and an unlimited supply of upwind sediment do not adequately
              explain observed dust emission relationships, data scatter notwithstanding. 
              PIs are proposing a combined portable wind tunnel and tower monitoring field
              study to quantify in situ the horizontal and vertical fluxes of coarse and fine
              particles as a function of wind parameters and surface characteristics. The
              collected database will also allow them to test the performance of three dust
              emission models that have been described in the literature with dust emission
              and surface characterization measurements. This knowledge is essential for
              revising or improving models that describe the emission process.  A model that
              can accurately characterize dust entrainment rates and vertical flux is a
              practical necessity for predicting soil loss due to wind erosion and for
              estimating relative source contributions of mineral aerosols to the
              atmosphere.
