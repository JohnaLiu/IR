Abstract    :
                   The investigator studies the dynamics associated with change
of
              configurations in filaments.  The theory of elastic filaments
is used as a
              paradigm to describe the different types of
instabilities, the
              self-organization of filamentary structures
and the propagation of waves.  The
              investigator considers
generalization of the Kirchhoff model to include the
              effect of
growth (as found in many biological process),
              general
cross-sections (with application to the dynamics of ribbons)
              and
viscous effects and perform a dynamical systems and bifurcation
analysis
              of the equilibrium configurations.  This analysis is
completed by the
              derivation and analysis of amplitude equations
for the behavior of the
              solution close to the instability.  This
project relies on the effective
              combination of different methods
such as perturbation theory, dynamical system
              analysis, amplitude
equations for partial differential equations, and
              numerical
analysis.
     Filamentary structures can be observed in nature at
              all
scales from the microscopic chains of molecules, DNA and
polymers, to the
              macroscopic braided magnetic flux tubes in solar
flares.  One of the central
              problems in filaments is to
understand the possible changes of configurations
              and the
dynamics involved in the changes.  Remarkably, despite
              their
different length scales and microscopic structures, unstable
filaments
              seem to follow universal configurational changes such
as writhing, coiling,
              super-coiling, and looping.  The purpose of
this project is to study the
              dynamics associated with the change
of configurations in filaments.  This will
              provide a better
understanding of universal changes and self-organization
              of
filaments, with applications to DNA configurations, structure of
polymers,
              evolution of biological fibers, and cable kinking.
