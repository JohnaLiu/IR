Abstract    :
              This project addresses growth of heteroepitaxial manganite thin films on lattice
              mismatched substrates to provide pseudomorphic films with controlled levels of
              strain and with controlled morphology to assess the primary influence of strain
              on colossal mag-netoresistance (CMR ). The film growth studies utilize
              Laser-MBE, which combines conventional MBE conditions with pulsed-laser
              deposition. Thrusts of the project are:  to grow fully strained manganite thin
              films with controlled surface mor-phology and low defect concentration using
              Laser-MBE; to control strain in the films by using different substrates and to
              fully characterize the strain; and through study of mag-netic and
              magnetotransport properties to reveal the strain effects on mechanisms of
              magnetotransport properties, the low field magnetoresistance(MR), and the
              magnetic and MR anisotropy of the man-ganite materials. These studies are
              expected to provide new information to better understand the origin of the
              large low field MR in strained ultrathin manganite films, as well as
              electron-lattice coupling, and magnetic and MR anisotropy in manganite films.

The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of
              materials science having high potential technological relevance. The success of
              this research may lead to advances in the technological development of devices
              based on magnetoresistance. An important feature of the program is the
              integration of research and education through the training of students in a
              fundamentally and technologically significant area.
