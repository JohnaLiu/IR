The objectives of this field-based research are to constrain
              the spatial extent and chronology of the northwest outlet of glacial Lake
              Agassiz, and to determine its temporal relationships with the southern outlet
              and climate change.  Lake Agassiz was also instrumental in routing glacial
              meltwater from the retreating ice sheet to the Gulf of Mexico, North Atlantic
              and Arctic Oceans.  However, the timing and location of the northwest outlet
              which fed water to the Arctic Ocean is not well understood.  Knowing the outlet
              chronology is especially critical because opening of the northwest outlet was
              nearly coincident with the sudden ending of the Younger Dryas cold period and
              with a pause in the warming known as the Preboreal oscillation.  The effects on
              atmospheric and oceanic circulation from meltwater discharged to either the
              Arctic Ocean or gulf of Mexico would have been significant, influencing North
              Atlantic thermohaline circulation.
