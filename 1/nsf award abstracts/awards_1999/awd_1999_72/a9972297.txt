Abstract    :
              A number of schools have moved organic chemistry earlier in their curriculum,
              some as early as first semester freshman year.  Many other schools would like
              to consider this option, if only there were a book that presented organic
              chemistry based on this level of preparation.  At Juniata College we have
              successfully been teaching such a course for several years, and, using that
              experience, we are preparing a text that should be useful to anyone else trying
              to teach organic chemistry to freshmen.  The text supports a course that eases
              in far more gradually than typical organic chemistry courses, taking time at
              the beginning to introduce thoroughly those general chemistry topics deemed
              necessary for the understanding of organic chemistry; reduces the depth and
              breadth of coverage of organic chemistry, while retaining everything that we
              deem necessary to biologists; and integrates biological relevance throughout
              the course rather than waiting until the end.  In addition to the text,
              materials will be available that suggest ways to modify subsequent chemistry
              courses to respond to the changes in the first-year sequence.
