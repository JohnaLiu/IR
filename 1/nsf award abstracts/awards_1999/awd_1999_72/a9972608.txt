This research explores the ways in which animals
              may benefit from the use of apparently low-quality habitat. Recent work
              suggests that habitat is the most important determinant of  presence and
              abundance of animals. Animals usually use a variety of habitats and may depend
              on use of low-quality areas, areas in which they are not abundant or which do
              not appear to support production and rearing of young. The proposed research
              will test several ways in which use of lower quality habitat may benefit
              animals. Low-quality habitat may temporarily support survival of juveniles that
              subsequently reside in higher-quality habitat, may provide habitat for males
              that mate with females that live in nearby higher-quality areas, or may vary in
              quality in years of differing weather and sometimes be better than currently
              high-quality areas. The research goals will be achieved by following the
              behavior and reproduction of pikas (Onchotona princeps) through the use of
              radio-telemetry to monitor long-distance dispersal or death. The result will be
              to learn how animals differ in use of habitats and what the consequences of
              those differences are for survival and reproduction. Age- and sex-specific
              measurements of birth, death, and movements will be analyzed using population
              models to estimate the benefits of different patterns of habitat use. 

This
              work will improve understanding of the value of a variety of habitats to a
              small mammal that  provides a model system for studying animal habitat use.
              Additionally, the work provides valuable information for game and non-game
              wildlife managers, other natural resource decision-makers, and land-owners who
              must understand the ways in which land sustains populations of animals.
