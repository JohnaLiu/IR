              Infrastructure: The Scalable Intracampus Research Grid for Computer Science
              Research

The University of Tennessee (Knoxville) will build a computational
              grid at the University that will support their research in grid computing
              systems as well as advance applications that the grid will eventually support. 
              The campus grid will consist of several grid service clusters - cycle servers
              linked in an advanced network.  Grid research will address middleware to
              support performance based management that can seek out most appropriate
              software and other services, support distributed data management, process
              migration, load balancing, scheduling and fault-tolerance.  Middleware will be
              based on their existing NetSolve project.  Other systems supporting the grid
              include the Internet Backplane Protocol for fine-grained naming and distributed
              storage, checkpointing research, and the Network Weather Service for
              performance monitoring.  Applications to be supported with the developing grid
              include medical imaging, materials design (such as lubricants), computational
              ecology, and machine design.  Applications will benefit from the full
              capabilities of several clusters as well as provide challenging applications to
              push the grid programming interface and technology.
