It is commonly suggested that pathogens will evolve
              toward being harmless so as not to cause the extinction of the host population
              and hence of themselves.  This idea has been disputed on the grounds that
              selection for reduced virulence would require differential extinction of whole
              populations, a process that has been considered to be slow and ineffective. 
              This study will use theoretical models to investigate whether the evolution of
              reduced virulence can occur in situations where the host and pathogen are
              distributed over a large spatial area, but where their dispersal is much more
              local.   Model assumptions will be tested using the anther-smut disease of
              white campion.  This is as a well-studied disease that partly sterilizes its
              host.  

Given present day concerns about emerging infectious diseases, it is
              important to understand why some pathogens cause very severe disease symptoms,
              yet others have only a small effect on their hosts. Disease symptoms can change
              over time as a result of pathogen evolution, but the predicted direction and
              mechanism of such change has been very controversial.  This study will model
              the processes involved, and therefore help predict possible future directions
              of change in the severity of infectious diseases.
