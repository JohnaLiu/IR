Abstract    :
              In order to learn what it means to conduct empirical research in Psychology,
              students need to design and analyze their own experiments.  However, students
              typically have few real interactions with the use of the microcomputer as a
              productive laboratory tool.  The problem has been the lack of software that
              allows undergraduates to build experiments on their own.  The shipping of the
              first version of the E-Prime system during the summer of 1999 opens up a
              fundamentally new way of addressing this problem.  E-Prime is a robust,
              commercial experiment generation system.  Because E-Prime is becoming
              recognized as the standard for building experiments in Psychology, it is now
              possible to construct a web-based resource that uses E-Prime as the delivery
              engine for a wide variety of instructional materials.  We will call this system
              STEP (System for the Teaching of Experimental Psychology).  There are seven
              specific goals in this project. 
1. Building a package of classic experiments
              appropriate for introductory psychology classes. 
2. Building 100 additional
              experiments as examples for the advanced undergraduate. 
3. Building computer
              "wizards" and QuickTime videos to teach experiment creation. 
4. Building
              tutorial materials to show students how to generate 30 classic experiments.
              
5. Writing instructor manuals with HTML links between sample E-Prime
              experiments and specific topics covered in current textbooks on experimental
              design and experimental psychology. 
6. Working with the E-Prime development
              team to include new features that are important for the teaching of
              experimental psychology.  In particular, these will include ability to display
              and control multimedia, administer surveys, and record ongoing observational
              behaviors. 
7. Creating the social structures needed to support STEP.  The
              project will be evaluated using a pretest-posttest design, item analysis,
              objective usage figures, and usability studies.
