This two-year award supports US-Italy cooperative research
              in dependability modeling and analysis of phased-mission systems between Kishor
              Trivedi of Duke University and Andrea Bondavalli of the National University
              Center of Electronic Computing (CNUCE), an institute of the National Research
              Council (CNR) in Pisa, Italy. The objective of their research is to define a
              methodology for the modeling and analysis of phased-mission systems (PMS).  
              Their approach to this problem involves the definition of a general modeling
              methodology, integration of the methodology into a tool for the automated
              evaluation of system dependability, and application of the methodology to the
              analysis of several realistic case studies.  

The US investigator brings to
              this collaboration expertise in modeling techniques for performance,
              reliability, and dependability evaluation.  This is complemented by the Italian
              expertise in a hierarchical and modular approach to the modeling of PMS. 
              Phased-mission are of strong interest for many industrial groups and represent
              an active area of research for application in such domains as aided-guide
              aircraft, nuclear power plant control, or on-board computing systems for
              long-life spacecraft.
