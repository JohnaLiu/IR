Reucroft
The research described in this proposal is carried out at
              major facilities in the U.S. (FNAL where the D0 collider experiment is being
              upgraded) and CERN (where the L3 experiment is taking data at very high
              energies). The high energies of the colliding quarks and leptons in these
              experiments allow for the production of particles predicted by the Standard
              Model, which is incomplete but describes the overall experimental situation
              without error.  The group is also involved in the construction of the CMS
              detector at CERN, which will extend the energy frontier well beyond  current
              levels.
