We
              propose to study the geometry of certain singular spaces,
whose curvatures are
              naturally defined as measures.  The
curvatures under consideration are those
              arising in the
Steiner-Weyl tube formula.  For smooth spaces these
              quantities
are curvature integrals.  For singular spaces they are the
              total
variations of certain signed measures which may be regarded
              as
generalized curvatures.  In all known cases these curvature
measures,
              which are a priori defined with respect to an embedding
of the singular space
              in Euclidean space, are in fact computable
solely from the intrinsic metric
              structure of the space.  Our
general goal is to understand and extend this
              phenomenon.  This
problem was attacked independently by Alexandrov and by
              Federer
in the 1950s.  Alexandrov's approach was intrinsic but limited to
2
              dimensions, while Federer's theory dealt with embedded objects
of general
              dimension.  Further progress will depend on the
reconciliation of these two
              methods.  We propose that the
technical key is based on the use of the
              geometric measure theory
of currents.  The starting point is the fact that
              Federer's
theory may be recast in the following terms: to certain
              singular
subspaces X in euclidean space there is an associated
              integral
current N(X) in the sphere bundle of the ambient space. 
              This
current satisfies the Legendre condition (i.e.  it annihilates
the
              differential ideal generated by the canonical 1-form) and is
determined by its
              relation with the Morse theory of X. The
curvature measures of X are then
              computable in a canonical way
from N(X).  Our proposal is based on recent work
              of the proposer
using the current theoretic framework, showing that
              Alexandrov's
theory may be understood in similar terms.  This suggests
              the
possibility of generalizing the intrinsic approach to
              higher
dimensions.

In ordinary terms, this project aims to develop a
              mathematical
language adequate to describe geometrical forms we
              encounter
every day: for example, the crumplings of a sheet of paper or
              the
surface of a rock.  Even though geometrical shapes typically
found in
              nature tend to be rough ("singular"), for technical
reasons geometry as it has
              developed historically restricts its
attention to smooth objects.  Our goal is
              to be able to deal
mathematically with such objects without imposing
              such
unrealistic assumptions.  We expect that this work will
eventually have
              a technological impact, in such areas as computer
visualization and the study
              of buckling of sheets (as of a car
fender during a collision).
