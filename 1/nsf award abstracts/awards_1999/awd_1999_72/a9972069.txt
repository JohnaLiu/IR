Abstract    :
              The Earth's ring current is the primary driver of the large magnetic
              perturbations that accompany a magnetic storm.  The magnetic index Dst is used
              to measure the intensity of the ring current.  It is known that magnetic
              substorms inject particles into the ring current system and it is usually
              assumed that the same process is involved with the major magnetic storms. 
              Recent work has suggested, however, that the growth and decay of the ring
              current during magnetic storms may be a directly driven phenomenon controlled
              by the solar wind.  This study will use hourly Dst measurements and their
              correlation to the solar wind electric field to investigate how much of the
              ring current is directly driven by the solar wind.  A database of Dst
              measurements covering more than 4 solar cycles (44 years) will be used to
              establish statistical correlations between Dst and the solar wind electric
              field.  In addition, specific events will be studied in detail by using a
              modeling procedure which will correct for the effects of variable dynamic
              pressure at the magnetopause, the existence of a substorm current wedge and a
              partial ring current
