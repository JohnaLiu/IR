Abstract    :
              Because FT-NMR spectroscopy has become a powerful, routine tool for the
              elucidation of structure and mechanism in chemistry, it should be a critical
              component of any undergraduate chemistry program. In order to compete
              effectively it is imperative that students receive hands-on experience with
              this valuable technique. A multinuclear high field FT NMR spectrometer is
              having a vitalizing impact on virtually every chemistry course offered for
              science majors at our institution. New experiments introduced in our
              laboratories include: structural isomerism in carboxylic acids; quantitative
              analysis of amine/alcohols mixtures by 19 F NMR without prior separation;
              microscopic protonation equilibria of polybasic molecules; T1 s to probe
              dihydrogen vs. hydride ion bonding in iridium complexes; stereoisomerism in
              tris(trifluorocetylacetonate) aluminum(III) complexes. 

We are using a
              systematic, graduated approach to our students' four-year NMR spectroscopy
              learning experience. In the first year laboratory, students identify a simple
              carboxylic acid unknown using an experimental Gram Equivalent Weight in
              conjunction with their interpretation of the acid's 1 H NMR spectrum. Students
              are guided to see the differences between isomeric compounds by comparing their
              experimental results. This NMR spectroscopy-based, experimental excursion into
              the molecular level gives beginning students a refreshingly modern introduction
              to chemistry and hopefully attracts talented students to elect further studies
              in chemistry. The integration of NMR into the undergraduate teaching/ research
              laboratory draws significantly upon the experience of two NSF projects: NSF-DUE
              9351303, NMR in an Integrated Advanced Laboratory; and an RUI-CIP, Acquisition
              of a High Field NMR Spectrometer.
