Manos and Jaramillo
	Graduate student Alejandra Jaramillo, under the
              direction of Dr. Paul Manos at Duke University, is studying the taxonomic
              classification of the large genus Piper (the genus of black and white pepper,
              with ca. 1200 species) and the development of floral morphology in several
              species of this tropical group. Piper species occur as shrubs, lianas, and
              herbs in the understory and canopy of tropical forests worldwide. Although
              individual Piper flowers are minute, the species express a wide range of
              diversity in unisexual and bisexual forms, including various types of perfect
              flowers that differ in the number and positional relationships of their
              stamens. However, patterns of floral variation have not been independently
              tested as reliable indicators of phylogenetic (or genealogical) relationship.
              This project will emphasize the DNA sequencing of both nuclear and chloroplast
              genes as sources of evidence to construct a framework phylogeny for ca. 130
              species representative of the subgenera and geographical diversity known for
              the genus, in order further to study ontogenetic (developmental) stages in
              flower morphology. Ontogenetic modifications, such as dioecy and extreme stamen
              reduction, will be mapped onto phylogenies to test the association between
              floral innovation and diversification across the genus. Phylogenetic analysis
              will also improve the subgeneric and sectional classification of this large
              genus, and help advance improved species-level delimitation. An improved
              understanding of the evolutionary history of Piper provides an opportunity to
              identify key floral innovations in the diversification of the largest genus of
              "primitive" dicots.
