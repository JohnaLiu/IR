The role of species
              diversity, species composition, functional-group diversity and functional-group
              composition in determining ecosystem function has been a topic of much recent
              concern for ecologists.  A dependence of function on diversity has been
              demonstrated for a limited number of ecosystems.  This project will determine
              the relative contributions of diversity and composition to ecosystem function
              in the face of disturbance.  Research will be conducted in pond mesocosms and
              in natural ponds where food-web composition and diversity will be manipulated
              along with rates of disturbance.  This project will examine the consequences of
              species depletions in nature for the maintenance of ecosystem function.
