Abstract    :

Professor Reeder will attempt to describe and calculate explicitly
              properties and numerical invariants of representations that should be shared
              with the representations of a given L-packet.  He expects that he can deal with
              invariants like the ramification, the formal degrees, Plancherel measures,
              leading K-types and associated infinitesimal characters This work is expected
              to have impact on other areas of current number theory research like the
              elliptic geometry of p-adic groups, and the study of level zero Langlands
              correspondence.  

Scientists have long known that an effective way to study
              an object, mathematical or otherwise, is to study its symmetries. 
              Mathematicians have developed this simple idea into a general theory in which
              mathematical symmetries are generalized and arranged into their own
              mathematical object called a group.  Once this process of abstraction has
              structured the symmetries, the groups are brought back to a more concrete
              setting by representing them in terms of more familiar objects.  Thus
              Representation Theory becomes a very important tool for mathematicians and
              other scientists.  Dr. Reeder intends to study some of the basic structures of
              numbers by studying explicit examples of the representation theory that arise
              through this up and down process.
