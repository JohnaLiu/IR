Abstract    :
              This project will allow university biology students, both majors and non-majors,
              to augment their normal laboratory experience by studying biological structure
              and function both in and outside of class using computer workstations.
              Commercial software programs will allow students to 'participate" in virtual
              labs and engage in self-testing in order to provide them with immediate
              feedback regarding their level of understanding of facts and concepts.
              Web-based applications developed by the faculty and biology links will further
              enhance the students' experience. Computer-based exercises will gradually be
              incorporated into laboratory schedules as is appropriate and become a part of
              the standard curriculum for the Human Anatomy, Human Physiology, Human Biology
              and General Biology courses. As a result of this new technology in our
              undergraduate laboratories, our students will gain a better understanding of
              general biological principles while increasing their level of computer literacy
              and confidence.
