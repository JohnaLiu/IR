              Infrastructure: A Two-tier Computation and Visualization Facility for
              Multiscale Problems

Cornell University, in conjunction with Iowa State
              University, the University of Delaware, and the University of Notre Dame, will
              build an infrastructure for scientific computing and visualization. The
              equipment purchased under this grant will consist of virtual reality (VR)
              hardware, and a number of NT workstations. In addition, Cornell is acquiring a
              large cluster of NT machines from other sources, which they anticipate will
              eventually be the world's largest such cluster. This hardware will support two
              computational science projects, one in fracture mechanics and one in
              computational molecular biology. In turn, compiler and runtime systems projects
              will be supported and will be driven by the demands of these applications while
              using the same hardware.
