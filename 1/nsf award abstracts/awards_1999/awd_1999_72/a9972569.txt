DDIG: Soil organic carbon following
              deforestation in a spatially variable tropical landscape

Recent studies have
              suggested that the direction, magnitude, and rate of change in soil organic
              carbon pools following deforestation in the tropics are dependent upon initial
              soil conditions and site factors.  However, most global or continental-scale
              assessments of the flux of CO2 due to soil organic carbon oxidation with
              land-use change assume an average rate of soil organic carbon decay. To assess
              the role of geographic variation in mediating soil carbon dynamics following
              forest clearing, the PIs will quantify the relationship between changes in
              carbon pools and site factors such as soil age and texture, climate, site
              productivity, land-use history, and initial conditions for a well-studied
              landscape in Costa Rica. These studies will provide insights into the processes
              influencing soil carbon dynamics following land-use change, the importance of
              geographic variability to large-scale carbon inventories, and improved methods
              for incorporating fine-scale information into large-scale assessments.
