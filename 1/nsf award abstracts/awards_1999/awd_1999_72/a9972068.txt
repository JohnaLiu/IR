Abstract    :
              This is the 3rd in a series of international conferences designed to bring
              together experts in the field to exchange information on research progress and
              to discuss new ideas and discoveries.  The first two meetings were held in
              Europe.  Some 250 participants are expected with many coming from abroad. 
              Representatives of all of the gravity wave interferometers in the world (LIGO,
              VIRGO, GEO, TAMA, ACIGA) will present status reports on these projects.  Most
              of the conference sessions are devoted to advances in technology necessary to
              enable detection of gravity waves.  There will also be reports from groups
              using Bar Detectors and the space-based gravity wave laboratory, LISA.  In
              addition, sessions will be devoted to gravity wave sources and to data
              analysis.  Thus this conference will bring together experts in all aspects of
              gravity wave physics to discuss the current state of the field.  In addition
              there will be a free public lecture presented by Professor Kip Thorne of
              Caltech.
