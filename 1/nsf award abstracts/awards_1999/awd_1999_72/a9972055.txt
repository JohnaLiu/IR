Abstract    :
              A coupled materials processing - experimental 
testing - mathematical modeling
              program will study how variations in 
processing time-temperature conditions
              effect the strength of the 
self thermal-plastic response of NiTi shape memory
              alloy fiber 
actuated aluminum metal matrix composites, and will investigate
              how 
the development of very high internal stresses in the material
              
influence mechanical fatigue behavior.  Preliminary results have 
shown that
              a properly processed and prepared NiTi shape memory alloy 
fiber actuated
              aluminum metal matrix composite (SMA-MMC) will exhibit 
very large, self
              imposed thermal-plastic compressive deformation 
under heating. 
              Unfortunately, very little is presently known about 
the processing
              sensitivity and thermo-mechanical-fatigue behavior of 
the material.  We
              therefore propose the following three major tasks: 
Task 1: Systematically
              measure how controlled variations in high 
temperature hot press consolidation
              processing conditions effect the 
shape recovery of the resulting SMA-MMC, and
              determine the 
mechanism(s) responsible for the material performance changes. 
              Task 
2: Perform a tensile cycle fatigue endurance study, identifying the
              
fatigue damage development process in the material.  Task 3: 
Mathematically
              model the self thermal plastic response of the 
material accommodating general
              variations in matrix strength, matrix 
flow properties, fiber volume fraction,
              fiber transformation 
properties, and temperature histories.  The overall goal
              of the 
program is to provide a quantitative design tool for the scientific
              
development of safety and cost critical commercial and military
              
applications.
