Title: Kan: A Platform for Reliable Distributed
              Objects
PI: Ambuj K Singh

The goal of the project is to design and
              implement
a distributed object-oriented system for supporting large and
              
complex parallel and distributed applications. 
The system supports a
              simple, yet powerful, programming model with the
following language features:
              asynchronous 
method calls, concurrent threads, guards, nested transactions,
              
and objects that can be migrated and replicated transparently. 
The system
              achieves efficiency and scalability through dynamic 
runtime optimizations
              such as an adaptive thread pool,
thread inlining, monitoring of object access
              patterns,
and dynamic clustering and granularity.
The system is resilient to
              node failures; this is attained
through low-overhead algorithms for logging
              and recovery.
Investigating weaker notions of object consistency 
that allow
              reduced communication between processors
is another goal of the
              project.
Shared whiteboards, electronic
commerce, and parallel scientific
              programs are some of the 
targeted applications.
The project will lead to a
              better understanding of scalable, 
fault-tolerant distributed systems.
