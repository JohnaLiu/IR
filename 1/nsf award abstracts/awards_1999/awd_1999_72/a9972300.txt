It is
              widely recognized that fundamental interactions are
described by soliton-like
              structures which are classical
solutions of various field-theoretical models. 
              The PI's main
objective in the proposed research is to understand four
              closely
related important types of solitons in field theories:
electroweak
              dyons, coexisting vortices and antivortices,
Faddeev's knot-like solutions,
              and the Born--Infeld solutions.
Electroweak dyons are electrically and
              magnetically charged
localized solutions in the Weinberg--Salam unified theory
              for
electromagnetic and weak forces in particle physics and the
existence
              problem is a variational problem with indefinite action
functional involving
              delicate constraint invariants and subtle
weak compactness issues.  The
              coexisting vortices and
antivortices appear in a newly discovered field theory
              and the PI
proposes to develop a full existence analysis and study
              the
topological and analytic structures of the solutions.  Stable
knot-like
              structures are important in describing several
fundamental processes including
              particle interactions and DNA
chain interferences. The PI plans to study its
              mathematical
existence theory and dynamical properties.  The
              Born--Infeld
theory has received much attention recently due to its
              relevance
in some areas of superstrings and supersymmetry.  The PI will
study
              classical solutions arising from the Born--Infeld theory
and their connections
              with geometry and physics.

These mathematical problems are not only
              interesting and
challenging, but also have important applications in a wide
              range
of areas including superconductivity and superfluids, particle
physics,
              cosmology, and molecular biology.  On the educational
side, the PI has already
              been involved in developing
undergraduate curriculum modules based upon
              applications of
mathematics. The research presented in this proposal will
              provide
new ideas for demonstrating the vivid interactions
              between
mathematics and other areas of natural science.
