Abstract    :
              This research in mathematical and computational gravitation seeks to make
              Einstein's equations more useful for observations of the cosmos which will be
              coming to us within the next decade.  Professor York will focus on the study of
              formulations of the Einstein evolution equations that are mathematically
              rigorous and useful for large-scale numerical implementation and for systematic
              analytic approximation.  There are also significant improvements in the
              initial-value equations, the canonical action principle, and the Bianchi
              identities.  This work will exploit the methods of hyperbolic partial
              differential equations from the mathematical literature, generalized so as to
              apply to Einstein's theory.  Development of certain fundamental concepts
              required for the existence of a rational general-relativistic statistical
              thermodynamics will also be studied.  

There exists tremendous scope for
              advances in understanding and practical use of gravity theory, matching those
              in experimental and observational gravity and cosmology that have been, are,
              and will be continuing to occur.  It is such theory that this research will
              continue to find, to exhibit clearly, and to put to work in the next several
              years and beyond.
