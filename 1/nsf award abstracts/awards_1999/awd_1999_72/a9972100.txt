The shallow water marine invertebrates around Guana Island
              (British Virgin Islands), and area of high marine biodiversity, will be sampled
              for two one-month periods during the summers of 1999 and 2000.   Especially
              targeted will be the crustaceans, polychaete worms, echinoderms, and molluscs. 
              Collecting will be conducted using a variety of techniques, including hand net
              collecting, scuba, traps, settling structures, diver operated box cores, and
              airlifts.  The majoriyt of the collecting will be exploratory in nature,
              sampling from as many different habitats as possible.  Quantitative sampling
              will be conducted at eight sites currently being used for fish surveys.  This
              will include setting out colonization structures to be left for a period of one
              year.  Some members of the six person scientific team will be dedicated to live
              sorting and photography while on the island.  A proportion of the specimens
              will be alcohol preserved to facilitate DNA extraction.  Specimen information
              including images and ecological observations will be posted on the World Wide
              Web through the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum.  In addition to the
              web product, descriptions of new species and an identification manual to the
              common species will be produced.
