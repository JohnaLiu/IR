     The investigators and their colleagues study the problem
              of
automatically clustering sets of points that lie on smooth
manifolds of
              arbitrary co-dimension.  They use the geodesic snake
approach in which they
              set up a Partial Differential Equation
(PDE) that drives the evolution of a
              manifold in some potential
field created by the data points, such that the
              solution of the
PDE converges to a manifold that is very close to the data
              points
(ideally contains them).  The "shape" of this manifold (including
its
              co-dimension) characterizes the set of points.  They
investigate
              computationally efficient implementations for
evolving manifolds of arbitrary
              co-dimension by level sets
methods, because of their robustness and
              flexibility.  These
implementations are being used to study the Euclidean and
              affine
mean-curvature motion of curves in three-dimensional spaces. 
              Two
applications are being pursued by the investigators.  The
              first
application is the detection of blood vessels in Magnetic
Resonance
              Angiography (MRA) images.  In MRA images, blood vessels
appear as bright and
              noisy curve-like patterns, possibly with
gaps.  It is important to detect
              those patterns independently of
the noise and to bridge the gaps.  The
              detection of blood vessels
can be considered, as a first approximation, as an
              instance of
the three-dimensional case, co-dimension two.  The
              second
application is the clustering of feature points in higher
dimensional
              spaces with an eye on two specific problems, the
description of the "shape" of
              a cluster and the design of
automated content-based image retrieval systems. 
              A given pattern,
e.g. an image, can be represented by a vector of features in
              some
n-dimensional space.  Patterns in the same class usually fall
              into
clusters that may have some very tricky "shapes".  The
investigators and
              their collegues believe that their methods can
provide ways of automatically
              obtaining shape descriptions from
sets of sample feature vectors thereby
              facilitating the design of
recognition algorithms and improving their
              performances.  A target
application is the design of automated content-based
              image
retrieval systems.
     The investigators and their colleagues study
              the problem of
automatically fitting a set of points in a
              possibly
high-dimensional space to a set of smooth manifolds.  This
              is
important because in many practical applications data can be
represented
              as points in high-dimensional spaces.  They are
currently pursuing two
              applications of these techniques.  The
first one is the detection of blood
              vessels in Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (MRA) images.  In MRA images, blood
              vessels appear as
bright and noisy curve-like patterns, possibly with gaps. 
              It is
important to detect those patterns independently of the noise and
to
              bridge the gaps.  The results of this detection can be used in
the diagnosis
              of diseases and in planning surgery.  The second
application is the
              description of the "shape" of a cluster of
points in a high-dimensional space.
               The investigators and their
colleagues are investigating means of
              automatically obtaining
such descriptions from a set of samples.  They believe
              that this
will facilitate the design of recognition algorithms and
              increase
their performances.  A target application that is
              particularly
relevant to the average citizen is the design of
              automated
content-based image retrieval systems.  In such systems each
              image
can be represented by a point in some high-dimensional (10 to
              20)
feature space, and images in the same class, e.g. images of cars,
cluster
              on some manifold, e.g a "car-manifold".  The description
of the shape of this
              manifold (which is simpler than the real
shapes of the objects in the class)
              can then be used to retrieve
all images of, e.g. cars, in the data base
              because their
representations in the high-dimensional space will be closer
              to
the corresponding manifold than to any other.
