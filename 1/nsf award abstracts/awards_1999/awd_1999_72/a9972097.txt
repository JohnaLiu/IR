              Multiprocessor Garbage Collection: A Post-Doctoral Associateship
              in
Computer-Communications Research  

The Java programming language has
              brought garbage collection (gc, automatic storage management) into the main
              stream as an important programming language feature.  Commercial interests are
              starting to build significant server applications in Java, running them on
              multiprocessors.  Yet very little is known about how to build and tune
              efficient garbage collectors for multiprocessor platforms.  The project builds
              on successes in building useful experimental prototypes and exploiting them to
              produce quantitative and qualitative results in the areas of garbage collection
              and the implementation of object-oriented programming
              languages.

Specifically, the project extends previously devised gc
              algorithms, gc toolkit software, a persistent object store, and a Java virtual
              machine implementation, to support Java gc (of both main memory and persistent
              objects) on multiprocessors and clusters (both shared and distributed
memory),
              and explores how to achieve good gc performance in terms of space, time, and
              minimal gc interruption.  The research results could be of assistance to
              commercial Java virtual machine vendors and server application builders.

The
              post-doctoral associate is given significant responsibility in all project
              activities, but in the context of a close mentoring relationship designed to
              support and mature the associate into a highly skilled independent researcher
              for future employment in industry or academe.
