Drs. Hunten, Sprague, and
              Bougher will continue a program of research on Mars.  Their work addresses two
              distinct topics: 1) the energetics and dynamics of earth and mars
              thermospheres, and 2) the measuring and mapping of water vapor content on Mars.
              The first of these projects, carried out by Bougher, uses general circulation
              models for Mars and the Earth to compare the solar cycle and seasonal responses
              for the two planets, and to investigate the wave responses of the upper
              mesosphere and lower thermospheres of the planets.  The second project, carried
              out by Hunten and Sprague, involves making Mars CO2 measurements that will be
              used to determine atmospheric dust and total scattering opacity, to correct the
              observed water vapor abundances, and to investigate diurnal and seasonal
              variations.  This work is supported jointly by the Planetary Astronomy Program
              in the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Aeronomy Program in the
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences.
