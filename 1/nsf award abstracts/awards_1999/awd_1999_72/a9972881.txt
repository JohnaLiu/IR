University of Rochester researchers will conduct research and
              pilot studies in ubiquitous visual computing.  The theme of their work is using
              high performance networking to connect devices that provide and use images in
              compute intensive settings.  Researchers will establish a protocol that can
              ship images and video transparently between workstations and the computational
              cluster.  Another project will implement a dataflow image computation model.
