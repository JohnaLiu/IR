Abstract    :
              The project involves developing highly interactive educational materials using
              the Java language, RealAudio, JavaScript, and other Web-based technologies, for
              the typical sophomore/junior course on Signals and Systems offered in
              electrical engineering and related departments. A number of important and
              difficult concepts that are well suited to highly interactive visualization
              aids and active learning approaches are introduced in this course. The Java
              user interface can be used to require student input and manipulation at the
              outset, for example, by using the mouse to sketch a signal to be sampled.
              Preliminary development of applets on Fourier analysis and convolution has
              resulted in  usage at colleges and universities around the world. Building on
              this base, formative assessment methodologies are used to determine best
              practices in the design of the material, and applets addressing additional
              concepts are developed.
