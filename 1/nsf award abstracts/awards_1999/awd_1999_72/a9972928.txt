The existence of relatively inexpensive transportation and
              communications across nations and continents has facilitated the flexible
              movement of persons across national borders, for short-term as well as
              long-term migration. This project involves the ethnographic research of a
              cultural anthropologist from West Chester University of Pennsylvania studying
              how African art commodities are imported, processed and sold in the US by West
              African traders.  The study will describe how transnational processes and
              increased access to speedy travel and communication technologies have triggered
              the short-term migration to North American of West African traders who ship,
              process, market and sell African art in the US. It will focus on a major center
              of this trade in New York city, and also follow the traders as they travel to
              distant markets.  Beginning with a census of the traders, the researcher will
              conduct participant observation both in the commercial center and on the
              trading trips, semi-structured interviews with a sample of 60 traders on their
              commercial and social strategies, and analyze how the new community of West
              African traders has developed in the US, and demonstrate linkages among new
              communication technologies and short-term migration.  This research is
              important because it will provide a rich case study of how members of so-called
              "traditional" cultures use contemporary technology to accomplish economic and
              social goals, and how the social and economic rules of the culture adapt in
              light of new opportunities.
