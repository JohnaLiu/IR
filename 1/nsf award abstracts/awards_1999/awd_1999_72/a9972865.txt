     The investigator continues studies of the theory
              and
applications of partial differential equations to problems in
turbulence
              and atmosphere/ocean science.  The project emphasizes
problems in
              atmosphere/ocean science involving four research
areas:
1)  Stratified
              Mixing, Instability and Turbulence;
2)  Novel Statistical Theories for Open
              Ocean Convection;
3)  Nonlinear Waves in Tropical Meteorology;
4)  Nonlinear
              Stochastic Modelling for Geophysical Flows.
The approach to all of these
              issues involves a sophisticated
combination of asymptotic analysis, numerical
              computation, and
theoretical mathematical analysis to gain insight into
              these
complex and important phenomena.  Inherently nonlinear or
statistical
              methods are emphasized throughout.  The project,
especially in the latter
              three topics, stresses
multi-disciplinary collaboration and exchange of ideas
              between
applied mathematicians, atmospheric scientists, and
oceanographers.

                  Behaviors of the atmosphere and ocean are complex and not
well understood.
               The project involves using novel and
sophisticated mathematical theories and
              techniques to improve
our understanding of important features of the climate,
              such
as El Nino, and the poleward transport of heat in the North
Atlantic. 
              Such an understanding could lead to improved
predictions of weather, climate,
              and environmental phenomena.
The approach involves multi-disciplinary
              collaboration and
exchange of ideas between applied mathematicians,
              atmospheric
scientists, and oceanographers.  The project is supported by
              the
Applied Mathematics and Computational Mathematics programs in
              the
Division of Mathematical Sciences, by the Physical Oceanography
program
              in the Division of Ocean Sciences, and by the Large-Scale
Dynamic Meteorology
              program in the Division of Atmospheric
Sciences.
