Lyme disease is caused by a bacterium that in
              many areas in the United States is transferred between vertebrates by ticks.
              Using the Lyme disease cycle as a model system, this project examines how
              ecological factors determine the distribution and abundance of a microparasite
              in nature. The first objective is to examine the effect of local vertebrate
              species composition on transmission dynamics. A natural host community will be
              manipulated through selective vaccination of the principal vertebrate host
              species, white-footed mice, and the effects on micoparasite dynamics will be
              monitored. The second objective is to look critically at how density and
              proportion of vectors infected differentially may affect transmission dynamics.
              Using a model and survey data on infection in ticks and mice, we will test
              which measure of infection better predicts within-season transmission dynamics
              in mouse populations.

Ecologists largely have ignored the ecology of
              microparasites despite the implications for population and community dynamics.
              Epidemiologists also often have ignored the importance of understanding microbe
              population dynamics in nature, focusing instead on vaccines and treatments. The
              results of this study will make contributions to both fields and advance our
              knowledge about these ubiquitous, diverse, and important organisms.
