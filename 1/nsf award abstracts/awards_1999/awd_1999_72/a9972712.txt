Abstract    :
              Brown and Lavrov 9972712
The phylum Arthropoda is the most speciose and
              arguably the most morphologically diverse within the Animal Kingdom (Metazoa). 
              While it is also one of the best studied, its phylogenetic position, monophyly
              and the relationships among and within its major lineages are still largely
              unresolved.  The initial rapid radiation of arthropods during the "Cambrian
              explosion" was followed by more than 500 million years of parallel evolution,
              often in similar environments; this makes it very difficult if not impossible
              to untangle arthropod relationships based on morphological characters or on DNA
              sequence comparisons.  However, understanding these relationships is essential
              if we are to interpret rather than simply describe the morphological and
              developmental data, and if we are to understand the processes leading to
              organic diversity. 
The aim of this dissertation project is to resolve some of
              the arthropod relationships by combining a complex molecular character, the
              relative arrangement of genes on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with DNA and amino
              acid sequence comparisons.  We intend to determine complete mitochondrial DNA
              sequences and gene arrangements from 13 representatives of major lineages of
              arthropods and some related phyla and to compare them along with 10 previously
              published complete arthropod mtDNAs.  The comparison of mitochondrial gene
              arrangements has been demonstrated to be a powerful means for inferring ancient
              phylogenetic relationships, while DNA and amino acid sequence comparisons may
              add resolution when more recently diverged groups share an identical gene
              arrangement.  This study will also address the dynamics of mtDNA evolution,
              adding to our knowledge of the nature of and constraints on mitochondrial
              genome rearrangements.
