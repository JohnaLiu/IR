To educate engineers who will be able to function in an
              interdisciplinary, technology driven working environment, Louisiana Tech
              University proposes to institutionalize a freshman and sophomore curriculum
              that integrates basic training in mathematics, the sciences and engineering. 
              This integration is to be achieved through content realignment and dialogue
              between concurrent classes and will build on an existing pilot program. 
              Salient educational components of the program are a focus on team-based,
              technology-supported learning as well as the introduction of key concepts in
              the context of engineering applications.

Activities that are included in the
              project are:

1) Faculty development workshops and mentoring by experienced
              faculty to broaden the base of personnel capable of teaching in this new
              environment.  These workshops will also reach out to local high schools to
              train high school teachers in integrated, active learning techniques.
2)
              Equipping too regular classrooms with laptop computers at every table to allow
              students access to the appropriate technology and facilitate a climate
              conducive to team work. 
3) Faculty commitment  to develop and adapt materials
              that facilitate active and cooperative learning to continue the shift towards
              active collaborative learning in all classes.  This includes the development
              and adaptation of assessment materials to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of
              the active, technology-supported approach.
