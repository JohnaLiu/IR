This project deals with the magnetic and calorimetric
              properties of the new class of layered III-VI Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors
              (DMS).  The III-VI semiconductors are known for their remarkable nonlinear
              optical properties. Preliminary magnetic measurements on GaMnSe and GaMnS
              crystals have revealed behavior strikingly different from that observed
              previously in the heavily studied II-VI and III-V DMS materials.  Two key
              features that make the III-VI DMS unique is their two-dimensional layered
              structure (held together by van der Waals bonding between layers) and the
              potential for direct bonding of neighboring transition metal ions.  The goal of
              this research program is to provide key information for unraveling some of the
              observed novel magnetic effects and to initiate an investigation of other
              transition metal ions in the III-VI semiconductor hosts.  The research involves
              undergraduate students as well as a local high school teacher and will impact
              both the quality of technically trained undergraduates and the motivation of
              students at the high school level to enter scientific or technical fields.

This project deals with a new class of materials with potential
              photoelectronic applications.  Undergraduate students and a local high school
              teacher will help make measurements using the state-of-the-art facilities at
              the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. They will
              learn a number of important experimental techniques while investigating a new
              and potentially important class of magnetic semiconductors.
