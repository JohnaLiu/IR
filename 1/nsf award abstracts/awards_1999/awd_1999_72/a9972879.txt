Research Infrastructure:
              Data-Intensive Computing for Spatial Models

Duke University researchers will
              conduct research on locality management for data intensive systems; locality
              issues include algorithms and toolkits to promote locality, fast and predictive
              data placement, memory system architectures (main, cache, and disk), network
              I/O, and mobile/wireless computing.  Applications for the research include
              computational sciences, GIS applications, 3D modeling and visualization,
              molecular modeling.  For wireless and mobile computing, transcoding for
              heterogeneous devices and power management will be addressed.  As an outreach
              component, Duke will work with Martha Absher, a Presidential Awardee for
              Excellence, who coordinates College of Engineering activities to recruit and
              retain minority students; their activities will center on expanding REU
              opportunities; they will also collaborate with North Carolina Central
              University, also in Raleigh, in computational science.
