The internet presents the potential for
              efficient and equitable allocation of distributed computing resources, such as
              high-speed computers and databases, to those best able to use them
              productively.  Realization of this potential requires a rotation for describing
              producers and consumers of resources and a mechanism for allocating them
              subject to bilateral constraints:  Consumers of resources may specify
              acceptability criteria for resources, and purveyors of resources may impose
              restrictions on consumers.  The Classified Advertisement language provides a
              precise and powerful notation for defining these constraints and the
              Matchmaking algorithm provides a mechanism for enforcing them.  This research
              improves the efficiency of Matchmaking by discovering and exploiting
              homogeneous properties of sets of Classified Advertisements.   It also extends
              the Matchmaking paradigm to "co-matching" to support situations in which a
              successful allocation required assembling a complete and consistent set of
              resources, each of which may impose restrictions on others in the set.  Thee
              enhancements are motivated by practical problems arising in the context of the
              Condor distributed resource management system, which is widely used by
              computational scientists to harness the power of idle workstations.  The
              results of this research will be tested by applying it directly to improve the
              Condor service.
