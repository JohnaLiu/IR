Abstract    :
              Foraging behavior of wandering albatrosses is unprecedented among seabirds. 
              They forage throughout the Southern Ocean with trips lasting up to 50 days and
              covering a total distance of 15,000 kilometers.   The PIs will study the energy
              costs and specific activities associated with foraging in adult wandering
              albatross.  This will allow assessment of the costs associated with specific
              behaviors so that their importance in reproduction can be evaluated.  A variety
              of tracking techniques will be used such as Isotopic tracers, satellite
              transmitters along with activity recorders to determine; 1) if parents adjust
              their energy expenditure by changing their foraging effort,  2) if differences
              in the use of  foraging habitat  by males versus females results in different
              energy expenditures for each, and  3) assessment whether foraging strategies
              are influenced by flight behavior and, if so, can energy expenditure be linked
              to differences in flight dynamics. This study will provide a comprehensive view
              of foraging to address the central question of how foraging strategies impact
              the ability of adults to rear offspring. 
In all multicellular organisms, 
              adults must differentially allocate resources toward self-maintenance, growth,
              and investment in reproduction.  All of these life history parameters are
              intimately linked to foraging.  Hence, the unpredictability of foraging in a
              pelagic environment such as the Southern Ocean has shaped the reproductive
              strategies of pelagic seabirds like the wandering albatross.  This species
              provides an opportunity to investigate the link between foraging, reproduction,
              and life history.
