The
              principal investigator proposes jointly with Karen Uhlenbeck
to work on the
              following projects concerning geometric integrable
systems: (1) to understand
              the symmetries and geometric aspects
of soliton equations, (2) to study the
              relations among Lax pairs,
bi-Hamiltonian structures, infinitely many
              commuting
Hamiltonians, Backlund and Darboux transformations, and the
inverse
              scattering transform, (3) to apply the techniques of
soliton theory to
              geometric problems, in particular, submanifolds
in symmetric spaces, harmonic
              maps and self-dual Yang Mills
fields.

The three most well-known soliton
              equations are KdV, SGE and NLS
equations.  The KdV equation describes wave
              motion in a shallow
canal; the SGE equation arose from plasma physics; and the
              NLS
equation describes the propogation of light in a fiber optic
cable and is
              currently used in telecommunication.  These
equations also arose in the 19
              century differential geometry.
The geometric connection gives interesting
              methods to construct
more soliton equations and solutions. Many interesting
              problems
in mathematical physics and geometry are now known to be related
to
              soliton equations.  The main goal of this proposal is to use
geometric method
              to study soliton equations and apply the theory
of soliton equations to
              problems in differential geometry.
