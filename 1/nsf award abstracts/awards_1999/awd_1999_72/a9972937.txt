Gas-driven volcanic and lake eruptions are one of the
              destructive natural hazards.  An eruption is a complex process involving a
              large system and many component processes.  The long-term goal of our
              investigation is to understand the eruptions and to mitigate the hazards. 
              Following our earlier work in experimental simulations and theoretically
              modeling of the eruption process, we plan in the next phase of investigation to
              focus on bubble growth and fragmentation, two key component processes in
              volcanic eruptions.  Bubble growth drives the early stage of an eruption and
              provides overpressurized gas for the later-stage violent eruption. 
              Fragmentation is a defining point in a volcanic eruption and turns a slow
              bubbly liquid flow to a violent gas flow carrying magma particles.  Experiments
              will be conducted to study water diffusion in rhyolitic melts, solubility at
              low pressures, and bubble growth rates.  The data will be used to construct
              water diffusivity and solubility models applicable to a large range of
              temperature and pressure conditions.  Such models and bubble growth data will
              be used to examine our physical understanding of bubble growth, including the
              consistency of all input data.  A fragmentation criterion will be developed on
              the basis of maximum stress theory and applied to pyroclastic flows owing to
              dome collapse (a fragmentation process).  It is hoped that these developments
              will significantly improve our knowledge of volcanic eruptions.
