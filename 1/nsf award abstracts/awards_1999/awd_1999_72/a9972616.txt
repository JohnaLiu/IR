Abstract    :
              
The success of coral reefs in nutrient-poor waters is traditionally attributed
              to nutrient recycling between the coral host and its symbiotic algae
              (zooxanthellae).  For nitrogen recycling to occur, zooxanthellae would
              synthesize amino acids from host ammonium, then return the products to the
              host.  This project will utilize stable isotopes to trace reef synthesis of
              amino acids, and their flux between the symbiotic partners.  The nitrogen
              cycle, starting in the animal, will be marked using 15N-labeled prey, and 13C
              will be used to label the carbon cycle via photosynthesis by zooxanthellae. 
              Individual amino acids will then be assayed for both labels using mass
              spectroscopy.
	
In addition to providing a greater understanding of the
              host-symbiont interaction, this research also addresses two controversial
              issues within coral nutrition.  Recent evidence suggests the host and algae
              independently conserve nutrients, rather than recycling nutrients between
              partners.  The timing and distribution of the isotopic tracers will help
              discriminate between these hypotheses.  In addition, corals can reportedly
              produce amino acids that other animals are unable to synthesize.  The
              dual-label approach used here can help determine which "essential" amino acids
              the coral can produce itself, and which it must obtain through its diet.
