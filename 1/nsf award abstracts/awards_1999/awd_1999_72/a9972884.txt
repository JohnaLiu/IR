RI:  Intelligent Information Spaces: A Testbed to Explore and
              Evaluate Intelligent Devices and Augmented Realities

The University of
              Illinois will explore an experimental information space infrastructure than can
              couple handhelds, wearables, responsive objects, video, multimedia, real and
              virtual prototyping, and VR.  Research to support this environment will be
              undertaken in component composition, automatic configuration of devices,
              adaptation, power and resource management, seamless communication and mobile
              QoS, modality transduction across varied devices, and new information access
              metaphors.  The PI's will address applications in education that will both
              integrate the activities of the information space as well as provide a
              mechanism to reach women students and encourage their participation in CISE
              research.
