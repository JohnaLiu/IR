Workshop: Integrating approaches to microbial DOC
              trophic linkages

The role of dissolved organic carbon in aquatic ecosystems
              is becoming increasingly studied, therefore, a synthesis of this information is
              timely.  In particular, its role in fueling aquatic food webs is being shown to
              be a significant component of many trophic relationships.  The workshop to be
              organized by Findlay and Sinsabaugh will provide overviews of (1) the supply
              and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to aquatic ecosystems, (2)
              the pathways through which DOM enters microbial food webs, (3) the potential
              relationships between DOM characteristics and the structure of microbial food
              webs and (4) interactions between DOM and other ecosystem processes such as net
              decomposition, nutrient dynamics and susceptibility to human disturbances.  A
              book will be produced from the meeting.
