Abstract    :
              Most computer science instructors agree upon the importance of using structured
              laboratories to provide hands-on activities and projects highlighting the
              applications of computing.   As the consequence, the science of computing, that
              is, the discovery process, must be addressed by different means.  This
              proof-of-concept project is developing a series of interactive discovery-based
              learning modules to augment the introductory computing course for non-majors.
              These modules are designed to engage the student in a fully interactive
              pre-lecture exploration of a topic or topics to be discussed in subsequent
              classroom meetings.  They are deployed using the interactive capabilities of
              the World Wide Web.  The learning modules allow instructors to incorporate
              meaningful exploratory experiences in the science of computing without
              sacrificing the important focus of core content.   They provide a
              discovery-based learning approach that provides students with a deeper
              introduction to computing.

Materials are being disseminated through a web
              site and through the development of a textbook.   The evaluation is being
              conducted as a controlled experiment to assess improvement in student learning.
