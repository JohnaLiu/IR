Abstract    :
              This is a proposal from the University of California San Diego to hold a
              workshop to capture community input and to produce a publicly available report
              summarizing visions as to the future of NSF's Advanced Network Infrastructure
              programs following the present vBNS generation. This is an essential part of
              the NSF planning process and the information gathered and published will be
              extremely helpful to NSF and the R&E community at large. The Advanced Network
              Infrastructure program has a number of important constituent groups that should
              be consulted as a part of a post-vBNS planning activity. These groups include
              at least the following sectors: university CIOs and administrators, the general
              science and university research community, the computer and networking science
              research community, industry, and those involved with the Partnerships for
              Advanced Computational Infrastructure (PACI). This University of California,
              San Diego proposal will allow us to cover the computer and networking science
              research community.
