The coastal rain forest of Brazil once exteded 3,000 km
              along the coast of Brazil.  Because of the high endemism of the flora and fauna
              and because of the rapid deforestation of the little that remains, the World
              Wildlfie Fund recognizes the Atlantic coastal forest of Brazil as one of the
              most endangered habitats on earth.  Within the coastal forest biome,
              northeastern Brazil, including southern Bahia, is the most threatened, with
              less that 0.5% of the original forest remaining in a condition worth saving. 
              This project will collect the vascular plants and bryophytes in the rain
              forests of three Brazilian reserves (Una Biological reserve, the Monte Pascoal
              National Park, and the Serra do Conduru State Park) in southern Bahia, Brazil. 
              Approximately half of the specific diversity in these forests (estimated at
              around 1,500 species) is in the canopy and subcanopy trees, the most poorly
              collected and least documented part of the flora.  By the end of the project,
              the PIs will have collected well-prepared, fertile specimens of a diverse
              flora; produced annotated checklists of the plants of each reserve; and
              compiled a cumulative checklist for all three reserves which will form a core
              checklist of the flora of the southern Bahian coastal forest.
