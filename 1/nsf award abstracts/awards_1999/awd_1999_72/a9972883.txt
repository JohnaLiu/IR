Purdue will conduct an integrated research
              project in multimedia.  Areas of research are a multimedia research testbed,
              QoS management for networked multimedia, distributed multimedia database
              management, integrated security at both user and network levels, and media
              capture and presentation.  Motivating applications in veterinary medicine,
              nuclear engineering and Purdue OnLine, a course delivery system are an integral
              part of the project.  Purdue will enable increased participation of
              under-represented groups through a summer course in the research areas for
              undergraduates from HBCU's.
