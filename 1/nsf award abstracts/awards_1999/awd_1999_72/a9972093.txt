Abstract    :
                    The goal of this project is to carry out a comprehensive biotic survey of
              the prokaryotic, fungal, and protistan life inhabiting surficial sediments in
              Mid-Atlantic estuarine environments.  These environments are highly productive
              and are considered key habitats for the maintenance of healthy coastal marine
              ecosystems; however, due to their close proximity to areas of coastal
              development, they are often subject to human encroachment.  This project will
              utilize a combined molecular and cultural analysis of RNA and DNA extracted
              from environmental samples and then identify important groups of microbes.  The
              primary experimental sampling site will be Hog Island, a large estuarine
              ecosystem on the Atlantic coast of Virgina and an LTER site.
