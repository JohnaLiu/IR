This project is designed to survey the insect
              fauna-primarily Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Coleoptera--of eight of
              Columbia's National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries.  Samples will be collected
              by local park naturalists and sorted in country by local experts.  The timing
              is critical since Colombia is experiencing rapid forest loss and difficult
              social problems related to population growth, political instability, and
              illegal drug trade.  This project is strongly interactive with the von Humboldt
              Institute, and the Colombian Ministry of National Parks.  Field samples will be
              collected by local park naturalists and volunteers, and sorted in country by
              trained parataxonomists.  Research products will include checklists,
              interactive keys, and fully accessible databases.
