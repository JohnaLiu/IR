The proposed research will consider the development of recent
              approaches to optimal control, reinforceraent learning, and performance
              evaluation for complex systems.  The methods to be employed are based upon
              recent work conducted by the PI on Markov chain stability theory, linear
              programming methods, and fluid model approximation.

Research on dynamic
              optimization will be based on a recent discovery of the PI which establishes a
              relationship between the optimal control of a stochastic model, and the optimal
              control of a simpler 'leaky bucket' fluid model.  The latter gives rise to a
              constrained L1 optimal control problem which can be solved in many practical
              examples.

The optimization theory will be improved through a deeper analysis
              of linear programming methods for approximating the value function in the
              optimal control problem of interest.

Reinforcement learning algorithms will
              be considered for policy improvement in stochastic models.  The PI will again
              base the analysis on fluid model approximations.

Specific applications
              include the development of scheduling and routing algorithms for multiclass
              queueing networks.  The algorithms will be based upon translations of fluid
              policies; tranlations of fluid value function approximations; and the
              application of reinforcement learning techniques.
