Abstract    :
              In concert with a larger process of academic changes within the Chemistry
              Department and across the Mount Holyoke College campus, development of a
              year-long, project-oriented laboratory course in contemporary experimentation
              is underway.  This course introduces students to the application of
              instrumental and spectroscopic methods to questions about fundamental quantum
              mechanics; organic, inorganic, biological and solid-state materials; the
              development of catalytic methods; and biophysical chemistry.  In developing the
              new course, we have built upon curricular experiments on a variety of campuses,
              many of which were supported by the NSF-ILI program.  This support took two
              forms: funds for a particular instrument that would be used in the integrated
              lab (e.g., FTIR, #8950694 ; GC/MS, #9451465), or, more rarely, for the
              development of a range of experiments for introduction into an extant
              integrated lab course (e.g., #9650638, #9653007).  During the three-year
              development period, the co-PIs are studying integrated lab courses on other
              campuses (e.g., the NSF-funded courses at Sweet Briar, Guilford, UMD, UNH) and
              incorporating their successes and lessons.  The new course should become a
              centerpiece of Mount Holyoke's chemistry major, and should provide a secure
              foundation for thesis research in the senior year.
