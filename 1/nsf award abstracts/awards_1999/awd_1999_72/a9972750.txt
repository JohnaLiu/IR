The goal of this project is the systematic experimental study
              of pressure-induced transformations of simple molecular materials to static
              ultrahigh pressures above 300 GPa (3 megabars) using recently developed
              diamond-anvil cell techniques. The experiments focus on pressure-induced
              transformations in representative systems such as H2, H2O, CH4, N2, O2, S, rare
              gases, and dense molecular compounds formed from these materials, as well as in
              simple metals such as Li and Na. New single-crystal, polycrystalline, and
              radial x-ray methods are used to determine crystal structures above 100 GPa in
              these systems. Vibrational and electronic properties will be measured by
              optical, synchrotron infrared, and Raman spectroscopy in order to extend the
              phase diagrams, examine quantum and other dynamical effects, and to determine
              the stability limit of the different molecular forms. New highly sensitive
              magnetic susceptibility and resistivity methods allow measurements of
              superconductivity and identification of other transformations to novel states
              of electronic and magnetic order to 200-300 GPa in these materials. Finally,
              the pressure range of techniques used to investigate dense materials under
              static conditions will be extended.
