The deformation of rocks in most tectonic environments
              involves extensive rock-fluid interactions that affect chemistry, mineralogy,
              and physical properties such as mechanical strength.  This project is aimed at
              examining fluid-rock interactions involved during fold development, a facet
              receiving little attention in comparison to fluid-rock interaction in fault
              rocks.  The project will employ several techniques to define
              paleohydrostratigraphic units in a well exposed fold and compare the
              spacio-temporal evolution of these units with mechanical units exhibiting
              characteristic deformation patterns.  Results will be used to test whether
              paleohydrostratigraphic units correlate with mechanical units, and whether
              fluids are rock-buffered and fluid flow is compartmentalized for the duration
              of the folding process, factors important in understanding the role folds play
              in regional orogenic fluid systems.
