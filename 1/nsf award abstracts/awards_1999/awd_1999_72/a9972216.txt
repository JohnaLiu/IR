Realistic interactive multimedia
              involving vision, animation, and multimedia collaboration is likely to become
              an important aspect of future computer applications.  The scalable parallelism
              inherent in such applications coupled with their computational demands make
              them ideal candidates for SMPs and clusters of SMPs.  These applications are
              highly dynamic and have novel requirements such as the need for temporally
              indexing the data produced by the application.  There is a mismatch between the
              abstractions commonly available for parallel programming and such requirements,
              leading to a considerable effort on the application developer both in terms of
              correctness and performance.  The goal of the proposed research is the design
              and evaluation of parallel programming abstractions, runtime mechanisms, and
              resource management algorithms suited to the needs of such complex
              applications.    In particular, the following contributions are expected:  (a)
              Design and evaluation of high-level parallel programming abstractions, and the
              evaluation of the tradeoff between performance and programmability in using
              such abstractions, (b) Design and evaluation of runtime mechanisms (such as
              time management and distributed garbage collections) for implementing such
              abstractions efficiently in a cluster, and (c) Design and evaluation of
              application-conscious resource management mechanisms in a cluster.
