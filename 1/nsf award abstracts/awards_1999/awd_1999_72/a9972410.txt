Abstract    :
              This project will bring together a committee of experts from industry and
              academia to examine basic research and technological innovations, with the dual
              goals of: (1) Determining the financial impact of technological innovations in
              communications and information theory, and (2) Ascertaining the research model
              that was used in developing these innovations.  The committee will be convened
              for a one-day meeting on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas,
              TX, to develop the findings.  A draft report will then be prepared and
              submitted to the committee for comments.  A final report will then be submitted
              to NSF, posted on the SMU web site, and distributed via hardcopy upon request. 
              The report will contain a succinct summary of what are considered the most
              significant technological advances in communications, their estimated financial
              impact, and the basic research environment that lead to these advances.  The
              report will also include recommendations for future research planning, with the
              goal of increasing or sustaining the influence of basic research in
              communications and information theory on technological innovations.
