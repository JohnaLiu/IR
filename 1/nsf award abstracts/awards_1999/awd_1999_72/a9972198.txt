Abstract    :
              The excitement of working with state-of-the-art equipment is a very important
              factor in attracting students to scientific careers.  Providing that excitement
              and thereby attracting students to science is the primary goal of this project.
              Prior to this project, students in our undergraduate laboratories had no access
              to NMR spectroscopy. The goal of this project is to provide spectrometer to our
              undergraduate students via a modern two-channel 300 MHz NMR spectrometer with a
              flow cell probe and sample handler. The laboratory curriculum is invigorated
              from a newly implemented series of experiments.  Undergraduate students in the
              organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry laboratories have access to NMR
              spectra of all of their synthesized compounds. Access is provided for physical
              chemistry laboratory projects and to honors research students.  Instruction in
              the acquisition of their own NMR spectra is provided to students of a newly
              implemented advanced organic chemistry laboratory and honors individual
              research. Summative and formative evaluations of this project are being
              conducted in consultation with the Coordinator of Assessment and Evaluation in
              the FSU Educational Services Program. The integration of this technology into
              our laboratory instruction significantly enhances the scientific educational
              experience of ~300 students each year, 21% of whom are minorities and 55% of
              whom are women.  This project adapts gains from the "Integrated Chemical
              Instruction and Computation: Local and Distance Learning Evaluation" project
              (NSF DUE 9751465).  The results of this curriculum adaptation and
              implementation are planned for dissemination via the FSU Department of
              Chemistry Undergraduate Program WWW page and to national NMR and Chemical
              Educational conferences.
