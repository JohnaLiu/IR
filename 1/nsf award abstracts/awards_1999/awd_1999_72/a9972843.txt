RI:  Ambient Computational Environments

The University of
              Kansas (KU) will conduct research on Ambient Computational Environments (ACE)
              in which computational resources are available in offices, conference rooms,
              and other places and users are able to co-opt the use of these resources
              through authorization.  User sessions are long lived and move among locations. 
              To enable transitions and shared use, the ACE will include multiple interaction
              modes such as visual recognition, voice, gesture, etc.  Research in techniques
              for access and interaction with environments, languages and run-time systems to
              support long-lived, mobile sessions, task negotiation among multiple user
              workspaces, context sensitive information retrieval, and disambiguation of
              speech and gestures will be performed.  The PI team will work to increase
              recruiting of women and minorities at both the faculty and student levels.
