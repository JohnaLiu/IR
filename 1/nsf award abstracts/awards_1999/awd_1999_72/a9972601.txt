Abstract    :
              The symposium ``Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics 4'' will be held at Carnegie
              Mellon University  on Friday September 24 and Saturday September 25, 1999. 
              

The symposium will include three extended presentations of applications of
              Bayesian methods. In these applications the statistician has been an integral
              member of the research team. Two contributed poster sessions will also be held.
              The objectives of the symposium are to:
(i)   identify and focus attention on
              specific implementation and theoretical problems that hinder applications of
              Bayesian methods, and to identify candidate solutions;
(ii) provide a forum in
              which the interplay between statistical theory and practice will be explored in
              the context of concrete research projects; 
(iii) provide a small-meeting
              atmosphere within which junior investigators and graduate students can explore
              substantial Bayesian applications with experienced researchers; and
(iv)
              produce a volume containing well-documented case studies 
and data sets
              suitable for use by researchers, practitioners, educators and students of 
              applied statistics  and other quantitative fields.

As increasingly much
              background information becomes available to scientists undertaking an
              investigation, it is important to utilize previous knowledge effectively in
              designing studies and analyzing data. Bayesian statistical methods are tailored
              to this purpose. There have been many recent advances in Bayesian statistical
              theory and computation, but scientific meetings rarely spend substantial time
              discussing applications. The purpose of this symposium is to concentrate
              attention solely on applications of Bayesian statistics. The goal is to
              elucidate the interplay between theory and practice and thereby identify
              successful methods and indicate important directions for future research.
