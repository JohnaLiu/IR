Zooplankton communities
              are structured by biotic and abiotic factors but also by dispersal among
              habitats.  Patterns of regional diversity suggest that there is not limit to
              local diversity and that species are limited by dispersal.  Experimental
              introductions of species, however, indicate that communities are nearly
              saturated with species.  This proposal would resolve this contrast by examining
              the assumption that species interactions place an upper limit on local
              diversity.  It presents a metapopulation model to examine the effects of
              competition, predation and dispersal limitation on patterns of local and
              regional diversity.  It would test the model empirically examining the role of
              predation as it influences zooplankton communities and consider the
              interactions of dispersal and predation.
