This grant provides partial support for the acquisition of a
              noble gas mass spectrometer, CO2 laser and associated equipment for gas
              extraction and purification for geochronological and petrologic research at the
              University of Wisconsin, Department of Geological Sciences.  This facility,
              under the direction of Dr. Bradley Singer, would primarily be restricted to the
              measurement of isotopes of Argon to date relatively young (Quaternary)
              volcanics but the applications of the technique are broad and valuable for
              constraining the timing of tectonic events, geomagnetic field reversals and
              weathering processes.  Dr. Singer's diverse research plans include studies of
              the dynamics and timing of explosive arc volcanism (i.e. Mt. Vesuvius, Aleutian
              Islands), constraining the timing of Pliocene to Holocene geomagnetic field
              reversals, determining the timing of Quaternary glacial events in the Southern
              Hemisphere, and documenting the history of basin development recorded in the
              oil shale bearing Green River Formation, all of which will gain from the
              availability of an in-house facility for high precision Ar/Ar geochronology.
