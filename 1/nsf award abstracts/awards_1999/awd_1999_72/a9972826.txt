     The investigator and his colleagues continue studies
              of
biomolecular motors and mechanochemical phenomena at the
microscale.  They
              focus attention on two particular protein
motors: ATP synthase and kinesin. 
              The former is a rotary motor
that combines in one protein the two major
              mechanism of energy
transduction: The F1 portion hydrolyzes ATP to generate a
              rotary
torque, and the Fo portion utilizes the energy stored in
              a
transmembrane electrochemical gradient to generate a rotary
torque in the
              opposite direction.  Kinesin is a molecular motor
that hydrolyzes ATP to
              generate linear force and displacement
along its microtubule track.  Both of
              these motors have been
characterized in great detail, mechanically and
              biochemically as
well as structurally.  The challenge is to incorporate
              this
diverse body of information into a comprehensive model that
provides a
              consistent explanation for each motor's behavior.  The
investigators have
              formulated models for both motors comprising
ATP synthase.  These models
              contain several phenomenological
components that must now be modeled at a more
              detailed level to
provide mechanistic explanations.  In particular, the
              process of
binding ATP to the catalytic site is the heart of the
              energy
transduction mechanism.  They model this process in detail. 
              The
starting point for the proposed kinesin work is their 1995 model,
which
              is tested against more recent data, such as trajectory
variance as a function
              of load (an experiment that they
suggested).  The role of elasticity in
              molecular motor function,
which they have demonstrated in the context of
              imperfect Brownian
Ratchet motors, is studied in kinesin (which is connected
              to its
load through a flexible protein linkage), and also in
              chromosome
transport during cell division, in protein translocation
              across
intracellular membranes, and in the elastic coupling that
connects the
              F1 and Fo motors comprising ATP synthase.  The
influence of the water
              environment on the operation of molecular
motors is investigated by developing
              a new
mathematical/computational framework for mesoscale fluid
dynamics. 
              This methodology combines a traditional continuum
description of the fluid
              with random forces that simulate
Brownian motion.  They use similar methods to
              simulate
osmotically driven water transport within biological cells.
    
              Mathematical modeling and computer simulation of living
systems is needed in
              order to make sense out of the vast body of
multidisciplinary data that is
              being generated at an ever
increasing pace by experimental biologists. 
              Biological cells are
now known to be teeming with protein motors, which, like
              tiny
robotic machines, conduct the business of life through
              mechanical
processes driven by the expenditure of chemical energy. 
              The
mechanisms by which these motors operate are fundamental secrets
of
              nature, vital to the understanding of life itself.
Experimental investigations
              suggest possible mechanisms, but it
is only through mathematical modeling and
              computer simulation
that one can tell whether a proposed mechanism will
              account, in a
quantitative way, for the observed behavior of any
              particular
molecular motor.  The goal of this project is a detailed
blueprint
              for the operating principles of these molecular
machines.
