Periodic extinctions of Laurentian platform invertebrates in the
              Late Cambrian have been attributed to changes in sea level and other
              paleoceanographic events.  Such hypotheses are testable but require a more
              precise and complete biostratigraphic, sedimentologic, and
chemostratigraphic
              data set than is currently available.  A thorough sequence-stratigraphic
              analysis of Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician inner shelf successions in the
              western United States will provide such a data set.  Sub-meter scale sampling
              for trilobites, conodonts, and Carbon isotopes will provide a highly-refined
              chronostratigraphic framework in which to test the posited coincidence of
              faunal change with times of sea level rise or fall and/or oceanic overturn. 
              Additionally, comparison of relative sea level curves constructed for the
              western (Wyoming and Montana) and eastern (southwestern US) paleoshelves will
              test the validity of numerous eustatic events that have been proposed for the
              Late Cambrian and earliest Ordovician.
