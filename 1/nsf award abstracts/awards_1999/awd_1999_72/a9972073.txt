This proposal requests support for the analysis of data
              produced by the FOCUS (E831) collaboration at Fermilab.  The data include the
              largest sample of charm decays recorded to date, an increase of a factor of
              fifteen over the previous run with this spectrometer.   The spectrometer
              features excellent vertexing and particle identification, both of which had
              been refined and upgraded on the basis of experience with earlier runs.  Muon
              identification was upgraded by the Vanderbilt group which assumed primary
              responsibility for construction, operation, interpretation, and simulation of a
              new outer muon system.  This group was also responsible for implementation of
              the multiplicity trigger. The new data set should allow investigation of
              physics topics beyond the Standard Model, such as D-zero D-zero-bar mixing via
              semileptonic decays, rare and forbidden charm decays (flavor changing neutral
              currents, lepton number violating, and lepton family number violating decays),
              and CP violating charm decays.  This group is also involved in R&D work on the
              proposed BTeV program in region C0 at Fermilab, which is intended as a third
              generation B physics experiment, in particular the PI has been selected to lead
              the muon detector effort.
