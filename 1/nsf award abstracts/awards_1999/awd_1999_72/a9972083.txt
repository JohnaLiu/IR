This project is focused on a program of biodiversity research
              that targets a diverse and obscure group of arthropod-associated fungi, the
              Laboulbeniales, in a neglected but potentially diverse setting.  The objectives
              of the study are to collect and describe the Laboulbeniales associated with
              beetles in native forests of New Zealand, to document the patterns of host
              utilization and species richness observed and to make the results available and
              usable to a broad audience.  The proposed research will result in the first
              south temperate monograph of Laboulbeniales and will provide data on host
              utilization and species richness patterns that will be of widespread
              application within the biological community.  In the loner term the results
              should be of use not only to mycologists, but to those scientists with research
              interests in phylogeny, biogeography, and coevoltuion.
