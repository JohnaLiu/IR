Long-Term File System Performance
Thomas Anderson
              

In recent years, the disk I/O bottleneck has become widely
recognized --
              as CPU performance improves much faster than
disk latency, an increasing
              fraction of overall system
performance is spent in the file system.  Worse,
              file system
performance often degrades over time; as files are
              created,
deleted, and modified, the disk can become fragmented,
              limiting
system performance.  Unfortunately, existing file system
benchmarks
              are too short to be of practical use in studying
this effect.  This research
              focuses on understanding the long
term behavior of file systems by collecting
              and analyzing detailed
year-long traces of file system use.  The work will use
              these
traces to evaluate several proposed strategies for
              dynamically
reorganizing the disk with the goal of improving the
              equilibrium
performance of file systems.
