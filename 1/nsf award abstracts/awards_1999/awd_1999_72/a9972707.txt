This project will study the
              comparative phylogeographic of rocky intertidal invertebrates in the North
              Atlantic.  It will combine standard phylogenetic techniques with  modern
              molecular methods to examine species in New England the Canadian Maritimes.  It
              will identify species that have recently colonized the region from elsewhere. 
              It will use theory and methods from molecular population genetics to
              reconstruct the historical patterns of geographic distribution and population
              dynamics for 8-10 amphi-Atlantic rocky intertidal species. Overall, the project
              will reconstruct the phylogeographic history of intertidal invertebrates of the
              North Atlantic.
