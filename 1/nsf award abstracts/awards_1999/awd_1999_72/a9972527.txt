Abstract    :
              This project aims to develop the theory, algorithms, and software for solving
              systems of equations made of composed functions efficiently, by utilizing their
              composition structure.  The project will investigate methods for various
              symbolic and numeric operations such as multivariate subresultants, Groebner
              bases, characteristic sets, and Newton iterations that are fundamental to
              solving systems of equations. Composed functions arise very naturally and
              frequently in most moderate- to large-scale engineering computations.  It is
              expected that the results of this research will have a broad impact on system
              solving in science and industry.
