The objective of this research is to evaluate how dispersal
              and landscape structure affect the distribution of animals in fragmented
              habitat.  The study focuses on the mountain viscacha, a rabbit-sized,
              rock-dwelling rodent, in the Patagonian steppe of Argentina.  The researchers
              predict that mountain viscachas disperse more easily over rocks than through
              open steppe.  Because colonization of habitat patches depends on successful
              dispersal, the spatial arrangement of those habitat patches and barriers such
              as rivers in an area determine the local distribution of the species.  The
              researchers use distributions of gene frequencies in DNA obtained from feces to
              infer past patterns of dispersal.  Relationships among distribution of the
              species, gene frequency distribution, and landscape features (e.g. the spatial
              arrangement of cliffs, rivers, and open steppe) are analyzed with a geographic
              information system (GIS). 

An increasing number of animal populations are
              restricted to remnant patches of suitable habitat.  Understanding the processes
              that determine persistence and distribution of these populations is critical
              for their conservation.  This research integrates molecular ecology, population
              biology, and landscape ecology to empirically test predictions regarding the
              distribution of populations in fragmented habitats.  This interdisciplinary
              approach may provide new insights into how animal populations in fragmented
              habitats are affected by landscape structure and, effective means of designing
              reserves and other conservation strategies for these species.
