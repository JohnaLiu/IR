This project will
              characterize the microbial diversity of major habitats of the Front Range of
              Colorado focusing on the terrestrial Crenarchaeota within soils.  The project
              is novel in the 1) regional geographic scale over which it will be conducted, 
              2)  the multi-scale nested systematic sampling design it incorporates covering
              distances over five orders of magnitude and 3)  the phylogenetic specificity of
              its PCR primers which will allow an exhaustive survey of the Crenarchaeota
              present.  It will be able to test whether there is an elevational gradient in
              diversity of this group that parallels those seen in other plant and animal
              groups.  It will examine the spatial scales at which microbial diversity
              responds to natural environments.
