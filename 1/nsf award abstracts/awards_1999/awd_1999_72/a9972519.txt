Abstract    :
              Algorithms that find a good partitioning of highly unstructured and irregular
              graphs are critical for developing efficient solutions of a wide range of
              problems including parallel execution of scientific simulations. The
              traditional graph partitioning problem focuses on computing a k-way partition
              of a graph such that the edge-cut is minimized and each partition has an equal
              number of vertices (or in the case of weighted graphs, the sum of the
              vertex-weights in each partition are the same). The task of minimizing the
              edge-cut can be considered as the objective and the requirement that the
              partitions will be of the same size can be considered as the constraint.
              Unfortunately, this single-constraint single-objective graph partitioning
              problem is not sufficient to model the underlying requirements of many current
              and emerging applications, especially in the area of high performance
              scientific simulations. In particular, the effective parallel solution of
              multi-physics and multi-phase computations in areas such as automobile engine
              design, crash-worthiness testing, fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, etc.,
              requires that the partitioning algorithm simultaneously balances the
              computations performed during each one of the phases and minimizes the various
              communication overheads--none of which can be accomplished by the current graph
              models and partitioning algorithms. The key characteristic of these
              applications is that they require the partitioning algorithm to handle an
              arbitrary number of balancing constraints as well as an arbitrary number of
              optimization (either minimization or maximization) objectives. This project
              will develop new generalized models for graph partitioning that are able to
              model the requirements of many existing and emerging problems in
              high-performance scientific simulations that cannot be modeled within the
              current framework, as well as algorithms for solving these problems. The graph
              models and partitioning algorithms will be tested and validated on a wide range
              of problems obtained from industrial and government sources.
