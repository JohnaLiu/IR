To study and understand the phenomenology of
              nonlinear soil behavior and its contribution to earthquake ground motion, it is
              necessary to devleop a model tht captures the essential physics of
              nonlinerarity of soils.  This model will fully include nonlinear effects: 
              anelasticity, hysteric behavior, viscosity and pore water pressure,  A critical
              feature of the model will be its capacity to simulate, with a minimum set of
              easily measured physical parameters, situtations ranging from laboratory data
              on soils to numerical model to explore the effects of nonlinear soil response
              on ground motion.  Numerical experiments are designed to compare the
              qualitative nonlinear features in computed and real earthquake signals.  This
              will determine the dependence between model parameter amplitudes and the
              magnitude of nonlinear effects in the signal.
