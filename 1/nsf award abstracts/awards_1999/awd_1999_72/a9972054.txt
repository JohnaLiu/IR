This project is designed to survey the diversity of marine
              phages from several sites in the Pacific Ocean.  Bacteriophage are ubiquitous
              components of the marine environment frequently reaching concentrations of tens
              to hundreds of millions of individuals per ml.  The decay rates of the
              bacteriophage are rapid, suggesting that production must be high to maintain
              the observed standing stocks.  While numerous attempts have been made to
              incorporate these observations and their implications-such as mortality of
              marine bacteria-into the marine microbial food web, most of these studies have
              ignored the specificity of host/virus interactions.  In fact, the diversity of
              marine phage is essentially unknown.  Characterization of the phage isolates
              will be accomplished by electron microscopy, Pulse-field Gel Electrophoresis,
              and sequencing.  These tests are specifically designed to identify the phage
              and classify them within known groups and to identify phage that represent
              novel groups.  This study will be the first to systematically address the
              genetic diversity of this uncharacterized biota.  The protocols develop and
              utilized here will provide the important background work for studies of phage
              in other environments.
