This three-year award will support US-Swiss cooperative
              research in applied mathematics and economics.  Dean A. Carlson of the
              University of Toledo and Alain Haurie of the University of Geneva lead the
              international partnership.  Researchers from the Federal Institute of
              Technology of Lausanne and the Centre for Industrial and Applicable Mathematics
              at the University of South Australia will also participate in the program.  The
              objective of this interdisciplinary project is the development of asymptotic
              optimal control and dynamic game theory for economic systems.  The researchers
              will apply these systems to an "environmental meta-model" coupling
              physico-chemical air pollution models with techno-economic growth models.  The
              models will be used for the assessment of air quality policies in the urban
              environment.  

This international, interdisciplinary project brings together
              US, Swiss and Australian expertise in dynamic game theory and modeling,
              environment, and applied mathematics.  The project will advance understanding
              of dynamical systems and their application to economic modeling.
