In the proposed research, a study of the surface and bulk
              properties of a series of semifluorinated (SF) LC-coil block copolymers will be
              undertaken.  While unconventional as mesogenic structures, semifluorinated
              groups provide not only liquid crystalline character but also
              non-reconstructing, low energy surfaces (contact angles vs. water > 120
              degrees).  The competition between liquid crystallinity and microphase
              separation will be examined.  The planned research will involve a synthetic
              program closely coupled to detailed structural analysis, including the use of
              near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) analyses to probe molecular
              level details of the surface region.  Finally, the choice of appropriate
              protecting group chemistry used for producing the target SF side groups will
              permit the surface patterning of these polymers with chemically amplified
              resist chemistry.  The use of lithography to direct the self-assembly process
              will be examined both as means of controlling surface energy and explored as a
              possible means of influencing self-organization of the LC phases and the
              microstructure.

Studies of these novel fluorinated, Teflon-like materials
              offer the possibility of creating new polymers with molecular level control of
              surface structure.  These polymers have prospects in applications ranging from
              non-stick coatings for anti-icing structures on aircraft to biomedical devices.
               Examination of these fluorinated polymers will also lead to a better
              understanding of photoresists for advanced microelectronics.
