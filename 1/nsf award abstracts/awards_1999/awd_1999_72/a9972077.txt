Scaling and
              self-similarity in turbulent flows represent two (related) viable approaches to
              address the mathematical complexities of this ubiquitos state of fluid motion. 
              These concepts are also expected to play an important role in formulating
              improved large eddy simulation (LES) models for turbulent flows.  It is
              expected that this facilitated workshop will contribute to the further
              development of these concepts and to their applications for the LES
              computations of turbulent flows.
