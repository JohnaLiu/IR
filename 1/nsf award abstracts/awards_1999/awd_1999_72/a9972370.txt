Abstract    :
              This project builds on the commitment of Iowa State University's College of
              Engineering and College of Education to the enhancement of the undergraduate
              preparation of future mathematics and science K-12 teachers.  Through this
              Proof-of-Concept project, inquiry modules involving the WWW-controlled
              environmental scanning electron microscope (SEM) are developed and incorporated
              into three courses for pre-service elementary  and secondary teachers,
              demonstrating the integration of WWW-controlled science content  into existing
              teacher education courses.  The modules support the learning through inquiry
              concepts and are consistent with the National Science Education Standards to
              improve the science pedagogical and content knowledge of pre-service teachers. 
              

The two pilot modules in the areas of Failure Analysis of Materials and
              Structure of Organisms contain a problem-setting video, an inquiry workbook, a
              kit of materials, and supplementary SEM images available on the WWW homepage. 
              The project complements the Iowa State Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher
              Preparation (ISCEPT) and the Mathematical Engineering Networking with Teachers
              of Real Science (MENTORS) activities.
