Abstract    :
              
	Red-backed fairy-wrens are small, passerine birds that successfully
              breed
for at least one year in dull brown plumage before obtaining adult
              breeding
plumage.  This delayed acquisition of adult breeding plumage
              by
reproductively capable individuals, known as delayed plumage
              maturation
(DPM), is widespread in birds.  However, much remains to be learned
              about
the evolutionary costs and benefits of DPM.  The proposed research
              tests
hypotheses for the evolution of DPM via behavioral observation in
              the
field, manipulative experiments, controlled mate choice trials,
              and
molecular genetic analyses.  In doing so, this project also tests
              the
effects of social status on male plumage color.  In addition
              Pruett-Jones
and Karubian will quantify male reproductive success in order to
              examine
the selective forces involved in the evolution of male ornamentation
              along
with determining the role of female choice in this process. 

	This
              project furthers our understanding of how selection affects the
evolution of
              physical traits (like bright coloration) and social behavior
while providing
              important information on a species whose social biology and
ecology are
              virtually unknown.
