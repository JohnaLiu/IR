Abstract    :
              Evi Goldfield of Wayne State University is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop parallel quantum dynamics algorithms
              and apply them to problems of current experimental interest.  Techniques to be
              implemented include a Coriolis coupled model of angular momentum in bimolecular
              and unimolecular processes, a full-dimensional four-atom quantum dynamics code,
              and a reduced dimensionality approach for larger systems.  Applications include
              rigorous chemical reaction dynamics for hydroxyl plus carbon monoxide, and
              cyanogen iodide photodissociation.  Also, the reduced dimensionality approach
              will be applied to the stereochemical dynamics of organic isomerization
              reactions.

The long-range goal of this research is to make quantum dynamics
              a generally applicable tool in chemistry in much the same way that electronic
              structure theory is today.  When this goal is achieved, chemists will be able
              to compute reliable estimates of important quantities ranging from reaction
              rates to detailed state-to-state differential cross sections.  This research
              will use the enormous computing power inherent in scalable parallel programming
              to apply quantum dynamics to larger, heavier, and more complex systems than
              done previously.
