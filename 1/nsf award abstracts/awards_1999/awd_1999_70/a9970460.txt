The main focus of this proposal is the study families of
              algebraic surfaces of type K3 with total space equal to a 3-dimensional
              Calabi-Yau manifold.  The string theories compactified on such Calabi-Yau
              manifolds and their dual theories suggest some interesting relationships
              between the theory of automorphic forms and thegeometry of such families.  We
              propose to relate this study to some known mathematical constructions of
              automorphic forms on the period spaces of K3 surfaces.

The area of research
              in this proposal is algebraic geometry.  This is the branch of mathematics
              dealing with geometric objects connected to systems of algebraic equations of
              arbitrary degree and in arbitrary number of variables.  It has roots its in the
              ancient Greek geometry of conic sections and the method of coordinates of Rene
              Descartes.
