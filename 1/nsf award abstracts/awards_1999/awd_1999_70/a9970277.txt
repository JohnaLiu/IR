Abstract    :
              9970277

A large part of the Principal Investigator's research on local
              cohomology over the last five years has been devoted to the study of a number
              of striking connections with several quite diverse areas of mathematics, such
              as etale cohomology, topology of algebraic varieties, differential operators
              and others including the theory of tight closure and (very recently) cohomology
              of groups.  While considerable progress on this circle of ideas has been made,
              a lot remains to be done.  It is proposed to continue to study these (and some
              other) questions by using methods that have been successful in the past as well
              as developing some new methods.

Given a system of polynomial equations, what
              is the minimum possible number  of polynomial equations in any system with the
              same solution set?  To this day there is no satisfactory answer to this
              question.  Local cohomology modules have a lot to do with this problem: if the
              n-th local cohomology module of a system of polynomial equations does not
              vanish, then every system of polynomial equations with the same solution set
              consists of n or more equations.  This is just one out of many applications of
              local cohomology to some very natural questions.  The proposal is devoted to
              studying local cohomology with a special emphasis on some fascinating
              interrelations with other branches of mathematics.
