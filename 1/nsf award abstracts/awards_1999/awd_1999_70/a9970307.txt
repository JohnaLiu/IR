Professor Green will continue his investigations of algebraic cycles,
              and in particular the image of the Abel-Jacobi map, higher Abel-Jacobi maps,
              extension classes of arithmetic Hodge structures, and the arithmetic
              Gauss-Manin connection.  The project will also consider the geometric uses of
              lexicographic initial ideals and their connection with certain regularity
              questions.  Finally Professor Green will return to the study the roots of
              Steiner polynomials of convex bodies.  He hopes that recent advances will allow
              the generalization of the established curvature inequalities to higher
              dimensions.

This is a project in algebraic geometry.  In this important
              branch of modern mathematics, geometric objects like curves and surfaces are
              modeled using algebraic constructions.  The abstract nature of the new
              algebraic objects makes them easier for mathematicians to study.  Nevertheless,
              newly discovered properties of the algebraic models translate back to new
              properties of the geometric curves and surfaces.  One key to this algebraic
              approach to geometry is the study of symmetries.  Mathematical symmetries are
              more complex and abstract than the familiar geometric symmetries, but they are
              just as useful in simplifying our view of the an entire object.  The Hodge
              structures that are a focus of this project are a kind of systematic accounting
              of tiered algebraic symmetries.
