Abstract    :
              With the rapid advances in computing and communication technologies, there is
              increasing demand for and reliance on storing a large variety of data types in
              digital form. Once data is stored digitally, it becomes available for access
              and retrieval using a variety of parameters. This project addresses the problem
              of retrieval of multimedia data, which tends to be very large and hence
              requires a vast amount of storage. To capture the information content of data
              objects succinctly, it is represented as points/vectors in a multidimensional
              data space. Methods for efficient placement and retrieval mechanisms for
              multidimensional data, based on exploiting redundant and parallel storage, are
              developed in this project. The role of data partitioning/declustering and its
              interaction with indexing to support efficient retrieval of multidimensional
              data is explored. Efficient partitioning/declustering techniques for retrieving
              multimedia data and NASD (networked attached secure disk) and active disk
              architectures developed during this proposal will be integrated with the NSF
              sponsored Alexandria Digital Library project at University of California at
              Santa Barbara, and the results are also expected to have a wide range of
              applications in multimedia information systems.
