Abstract    :
              Dr. Akerlof has designed and constructed three complementary instruments for the
              Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE).  These instruments improve
              on existing attempts to detect optical counterparts of the enigmatic gamma ray
              bursts in three ways: (1) they do not require accurate x-ray determinations of
              burst location; (2) they image burst locations very soon after burst onset, and
              (3) they can perform difficult background studies.  ROTSE is probably the most
              advanced instrument currently in operation which may provide information about
              the physical processes that produce gamma ray bursts.

Gamma ray bursts are
              short duration, high energy bursts of gamma rays.  They are detected by several
              satellites currently flying.  The discovery of x-ray, optical and radio
              afterglows of these events occurred in 1997.  ROTSE is designed to respond to a
              gamma ray burst detection and provide early alerts to the scientific community
              to permit immediate follow-up of possible candidates.
