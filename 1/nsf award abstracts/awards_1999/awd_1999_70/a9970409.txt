Abstract    :
              9970409

The number field sieve is the latest algorithm for factoring integers
              into primes.  The investigator is continuing to explore theoretical and
              practical problems related to the number field sieve.  He is also continuing
              his research into the fundamental computational tools in one-dimensional
              commutative algebra, including fast Fourier transforms and fast power series
              exponentiation.

"Today, a small group of technically sophisticated people
              could disrupt the computers and the Internet connections on which our finance,
              telecommunications, power, water systems, emergency service systems all
              depend," says Jamie S.  Gorelick, Vice Chair of Fannie Mae and Co-Chair of the
              Advisory Committee of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure
              Protection.  "Cyberspace is likely to be the next battlefield for this nation."
               The investigator's work is directly relevant to public-key cryptography,
              including public-key signature systems, the main tool for protecting the
              integrity of Internet communications.  The investigator's research shows
              precisely how long it would take an attacker to break the most popular
              public-key systems; this information is crucial for users who want to choose
              safe systems.  The investigator's research also reduces the amount of computer
              time necessary to use these systems.  The same research is useful in many other
              computer problems, including medical image processing.
