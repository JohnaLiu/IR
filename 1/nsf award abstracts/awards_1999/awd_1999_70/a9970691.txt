Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include studies of
              supersymmetry and other new theories of particle interactions.  Supersymmetry
              is a promising idea which predicts the existence of many new heavy subatomic
              particles. The properties of these particles, including their masses and decay
              rates, will be studied under a variety of different theoretical assumptions.
              The resulting predictions are important because they will affect the planning
              and analysis of many present and future experiments that search for new
              particles. These studies are also of central importance for understanding the
              behavior of physics involving very high energies.
