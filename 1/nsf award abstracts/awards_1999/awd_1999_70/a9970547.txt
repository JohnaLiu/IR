The purpose of this proposal is to study problems in
              geometric
Functional Analysis. The first problem is related to the notion
of
              distortion: Does every Banach space either contain a classical
non-distortable
              space or an arbitrarily distortable subspace?
The second problem is related to
              the concept of primeness: Is
Schlumprecht' space prime? Also it is proposed to
              attempt to 
construct a space on which every operator is a compact
              perturbation 
of a multiple of the identity. Finally the proposer will work on
              
constructing a Hereditarily Indecomposable weak Hilbert space.

 
              Mathematicians must study the geometry of infinite dimensional 
Banach spaces
              since these spaces provide the natural framework 
for studying non Euclidean
              geometries, Differential Equations,
Quantum Theory etc. The four projects
              presented above are of 
importance in the theory of Banach spaces and its
              applications.
The "distortion problem" which is concerned in this proposal
              
is a fundamental question in the geometry of Banach spaces. 
Also the
              property of "primeness" is very important for 
understanding the structure of
              a Banach space and its components.
The third problem of this proposal is of
              great significance 
in Operator Theory since it will shed light into the
              famous "Invariant
Subspace Problem". The solution of the fourth suggested
              problem 
will be of great interest to Physicists if the Quantum Theory
can be
              modeled in the space that it is proposed to construct.
