The investigator proposes to use Maxim Kontsevich's space
              of "stable maps"
(originally motivated by mathematical physics earlier this
              decade) to
tackle problems in a variety of fields.  Applications
              include
explaining the conjectured presence of modular forms in the
              enumerative
geometry of curves on surfaces, understanding various
              combinatorial
problems (relating to the geometry of ramified covers of the
              sphere),
generalizing stable maps to positive characteristic,
              algebraically
understanding the original motivation for stable maps
              ("Gromov-Witten
invariants") in a "relative" case, and using stable maps to
              understand the
moduli space of pointed curves.

This proposal concerns
              algebraic geometry, an area of mathematics 
studying geometric objects defined
              by polynomial equations. It has long 
been known that nodal algebraic curves
              are a powerful tool in algebraic 
geometry.  These curves can be thought of as
              surfaces with holes with 
pairs of points "glued together".  Earlier this
              decade, ideas from theoretical 
physics led to the introduction of "stable
              maps", parametrizing certain kinds 
of maps of nodal curves into another
              space.  This development has proved 
to be very fruitful, sparking advances in
              a variety of fields.  The investigator's
area of research is the use of
              families of nodal algebraic curves in
algebraic geometry, in particular with
              applications to other fields such
as enumerative geometry, arithmetic
              geometry, combinatorics, and
mathematical physics.
