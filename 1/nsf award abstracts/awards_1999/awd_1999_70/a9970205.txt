The Institute of Ecosystem Studies' (IES)
              Analytical Laboratory (AL) is a shared resource: on average 80% of its
              scientific staff use the AL facilities for analysis of ecological samples,
              ranging from precipitation and throughfall to soils and saline waters.  Growth
              and increased activity over the past several years have put tremendous pressure
              on the AL  to process accurately, rapidly and as inexpensively as possible
              samples from a wide variety of ecosystems whose chemical concentrations vary by
              several orders-of-magnitude.   The AL currently performs between 50,000 and
              60,000 analyses a year for major inorganic and organic ions, including sample
              analysis for many of IES's 30 (currently funded) National Science Foundation
              (NSF)-sponsored projects.  These projects include PIs from IES as well as
              collaborators outside.  Extensive postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate
              (through an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates grant) student research
              is also done in the AL.
As a result of this award, IES will improve
              significantly its analytical capabilities by replacing a liquid scintillation
              counter that was purchased in 1985, and adding an ion chromatograph, which will
              be dedicated to cation analysis, to the existing laboratory instrumentation. A
              new scintillation counter and computer will reduce the necessity for
              transcription and allow storage and access of data that are at the core of
              several research programs.  The purchase of an ion chromatograph dedicated to
              cation analysis will relieve pressure on existing instruments and allow
              investigators to analyze five+ cations on a small volume of sample at a lower
              cost and less technician time than is currently possible.
