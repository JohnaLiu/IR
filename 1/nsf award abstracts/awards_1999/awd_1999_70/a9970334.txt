Dr. Peeva will work on projects in the
              general area of Commutative Algebra.  Her project deals with the structure of
              the minimal free resolutions of Monomial and Toric ideas.  Ideas and methods
              from commutative algebra, combinatorics, and the topological theory of subspace
              arrangements will be applied to study such resolutions.  Constructions
              previously used to describe the cohomology of complex subspace arrangements
              will be adapted to yield minimal free resolutions. The goal is to build highly
              structured resolutions and subcomplexes of resolutions, and to obtain bounds on
              Betti Numbers and regularity.   

Commutative algebra is the study of the
              fundamental structures of mathematics. Results of commutative algebra have
              found uses in communications, security and robotics. By studying abstract
              mathematical objects, mathematicians gain deeper insight in many other branches
              of mathematics. The important area of modern geometry known as algebraic
              geometry is the strongest and most fruitful mathematical example of this line
              of attack.  Algebraic objects are substituted for geometric objects, and the
              powerful and abstract methods of commutative algebra are applied to further our
              understanding of the geometry.  Dr. Peeva's research should have immediate and
              direct implications in geometry and combinatorics.
