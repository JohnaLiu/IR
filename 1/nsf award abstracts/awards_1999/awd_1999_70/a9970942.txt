Abstract    :
              9970942

This is a joint project of E. B. Dynkin (Cornell University) and S.
              E. Kuznetsov (University of Colorado, Boulder).  The investigators will
              continue their work on relations between superdiffusions and a class of
              semilinear partial differential equations.  The program includes applications
              of recently developed probabilistic tools to fundamental problems on such
              equations as a characterization of positive solutions by their boundary traces
              and a classification of boundary singularities.

Superdiffusions are a
              special class of branching measure-valued stochastic processes also known as
              superprocesses.  During the last decades these processes attracted efforts of
              many investigators around the world.  Outside of pure mathematics, they play a
              significant role in population genetics and they provide new tools for the
              study of complex physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom. 
              These researchers will continue their joint work on relations between
              superdiffusions and differential equations involving a second order nonlinear
              function.  The research program includes applications of recently developed
              probabilistic classifications of boundary singularities.
