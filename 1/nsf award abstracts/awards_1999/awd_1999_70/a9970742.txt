Abstract    :
              The Allegro resonant detector is one of the first detectors of gravitational
              waves to operate for extended periods to search for burst radiation: the type
              of signal that might be expected from a supernova.  Coincidence searches are
              being made with the Explorer and Auriga detectors in Italy and with Niobe in
              Australia.  Allegro also has demonstrated good sensitivity in a search for
              continuous waves coming from a known location in the sky, though the sensitive
              bandwidth is relatively narrow.  In the future it will be possible to correlate
              Allegro's output with that of the LIGO Livingston site to search for high
              frequency stochastic gravitational radiation.  This award will provide funding
              for the LSU group under Professor Hamilton and Johnson to continue its
              successful operation and for the preparation for operation in coincidence with
              LIGO.
	The LSU group will continue to operate Allegro in coincidence with the
              resonant detectors in Italy and Australia.  They will continue to share data
              with the other operating groups and will continue to work with the others to
              develop a uniform and statistically robust framework for event detection.  They
              also intend to participate in the day-to-day work of bringing the Livingston
              LIGO instrument on line.
