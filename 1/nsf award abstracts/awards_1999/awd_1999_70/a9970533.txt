The proposer plans to investigate the area lying at the
              crossroads of representation theory of Lie groups, quantum groups and piecewise
              linear combinatorics. Several topics will be studied: canonical bases, crystal
              bases, multiplicity of modules for reductive groups and totally positive
              varieties. The main tools that will be used in this study are valuations on the
              corresponding algebras, the method of involutions, convex polyhedra and
              birational maps.

The investigations will focus on combinatorics and various
              algebraic methods in trhat area. The results can be applied to study various
              physical symmetries and their related mathematics.  This is an area that has
              had a large impact on physics and chemistry.
