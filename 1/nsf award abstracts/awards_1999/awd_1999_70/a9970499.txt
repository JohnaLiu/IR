Abstract    :
              9970499

The present proposal is focused on the study of sheaves of vertex
              algebras over smooth manifolds introduced in a recent work by Schechtman,
              Vaintrob and the author.  The ultimate goal of such a study is the
              classification of the corresponding cohomology vertex algebras and their
              modules.  This should find interesting applications in quantum cohomology and
              mirror symmetry.

The theory of vertex algebras is a mathematical tool
              intended for the explanation of conformal field theory.  The above-mentioned
              sheaves of vertex algebras are supposed to explain some recent developments in
              topological field theory.  This line of research has already produced certain
              results valuable for mathematics itself.
