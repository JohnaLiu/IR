Abstract    :
              Ground based observations of low redshift damped Lyman alpha systems

Observations of quasi stellar objects (QSO's) show patterns of
              absorption lines.  These lines originate in the intervening gaseous regions
              distributed throughout the Universe.  They appear as a spectral line due to the
              Lyman alpha series of hydrogen.  The vast majority of these lines are narrow
              Lyman alpha lines.  Occasionally one sees a line that arises from a very dense
              region.  In these cases the line is not quite as narrow.  These are the damped
              Lyman alpha systems.

Dr. Turnshek proposes to follow up the known low
              redshift damped Lyman alpha systems with ground based facilities in order to
              elucidate various properties of these galaxies:  luminosities and separations
              from the QSO lines of sight, HI cross sections, and number of galaxies per
              comoving volume; galaxy morphologies, surface brightnesses, colors, stellar
              populations, and star formation rates; element abundances and dust; and 21 cm
              spin temperatures and 21 cm metal line kinematics.  A wide variety of accepted
              and planned ground based programs are planned using several ground based
              telescopes.
