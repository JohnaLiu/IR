This award will support the acquisition of a suite
              of plant growth and environmental chambers for a plant growth facility.  The
              Plant Growth Chamber Facility at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 
              will be used by faculty in the Plant Biology Graduate Program for the growth
              and reproduction of plants under conditions of controlled light, temperature,
              humidity, and day length.  Specific projects will examine clonal growth and
              resource capture in Fragaria (strawberries), molecular and biochemical analysis
              of plant reproduction in Nicotiana (tobacco), the role of calcium and the
              cytoskeleton during division and growth in Tradescantia (spiderwort) and Lilium
              (lily), the developmental regulation of auxin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis,
              virus replication and symptom reproduction in Brassica (turnip) and
              Arabidopsis, and the structural analysis of paramutation at the R locus of Zea
              (corn).  The growth chambers will be located in the head house in close
              association with the Biology Department Greenhouses.  Day to day operation and
              maintenance will be undertaken by experienced staff, which includes expertise
              in both plant growth and in heating and refrigeration.  The facility will be
              governed by a core of participating faculty.
