Friedman
     This project will continue Friedman's work
              establishing the
independence from the usual axioms of mathematics
              (i.e.,
Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the axiom of choice) of some
              simple
and basic combinatorial statements.  These assertions
              involve
sequential constructions of finite graphs and trees, where at
              each
stage a feature of the construction is minimized.  This is in
              some
analogy with the so called ``greedy'' constructions in computer
science.
               The assertions tell us that such constructions can be
performed in such a way
              that the resulting object has strong and
natural combinatorial properties
              related to Ramsey theory (a branch of
combinatorics).  These combinatorial
              statements are provable from
certain large cardinal assumptions, but not from
              the usual axioms of
mathematics.  Results in this connection from prior NSF
              support were
used as an integral part of an undergraduate course in the
              computer
science department at UCSD.  In addition, under prior NSF
              support,
Friedman has discovered a new kind of elementary constraint
              on
sequences from a finite alphabet.  For each finite alphabet, there is
              a
bound on the length of any sequence satisfying this constraint.  In
              one
letter, this longest length is 3. In two letters, this longest length
is
              11. In three or more letters, this longest length is
              demonstrably
incomprehensibly enormous, and is closely connected to various
              topics
in mathematical logic and combinatorics.  These topics include
              fast
growing functions, provably recursive functions, fragments of
              Peano
arithmetic, and proof theoretic ordinals.  This topic was explored
              by
gifted high school students this past summer at the University of
Chicago,
              where students came up with 11 for two letters.  Friedman will
continue his
              investigation of this and other related problems
involving such simple
              constraints.  In this connection, Friedman has
begun a fruitful collaboration
              with Randy Dougherty that involves
substantial computer exploration.
    
              Friedman has managed to establish the independence from the usual
axioms of
              mathematics of some remarkably concrete combinatorial statements.
These
              involve the construction of finite mathematical objects subject to
certain
              constraints. The assertions tell us that such constructions can be
performed
              so that the resulting object has properties of a kind that are
normally
              studied in combinatorics.  Results in this connection from prior
NSF support
              were used as an integral part of an undergraduate course in
the computer
              science department at UCSD.  In addition, under prior NSF
support, Friedman
              has discovered a new kind of elementary constraint
on sequences from a finite
              alphabet.  The longest length of a sequence
subject to this constraint (for a
              three-letter alphabet) is
demonstrably incomprehensibly enormous, and is
              closely connected to
various topics in mathematical logic and combinatorics. 
              This topic was
explored by gifted high school students during the summer of
              1988 at the
University of Chicago, where students came up with the correct
              number
of 11 for an alphabet of two letters.  Friedman will continue
              his
investigation of this and other related problems involving such
              simple
constraints.  In this connection, Friedman has begun a
              fruitful
collaboration with Randy Dougherty that involves substantial
              computer
exploration.
