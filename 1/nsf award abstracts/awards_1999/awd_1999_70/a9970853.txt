Abstract    :
              The proposed study will identify and fill the gaps between currently available
              data and methods and desired ones in assessing and understanding the
              performance of SSI states.  It will address the following research
              questions:
	
1. What information is available on the academic performance of
              a system?
2. What methodological challenges are posed by multi-level,
              multi-dimensional time-series data such as the     NAEP and state assessments
              in understanding factors affecting system performance?

The researchers will
              examine these issues in two SSI states, Kentucky and Maine.  They will examine
              whether and/or how the current NAEP and the states' own student assessments can
              be used to assess systemwide academic performance and determine if the national
              and state assessments produce consistent results on the proficiency of
              different groups of students.  The study team will compare the results of
              hierarchical liner modeling methods with conventional methods of data analysis.
