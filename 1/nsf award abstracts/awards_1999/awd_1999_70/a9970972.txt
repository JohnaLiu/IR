Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are the design, development, testing, and
              investigations into mechanisms for separating milligram quantities of proteins
              using a novel electrofocusing device.  This research employs a free flow
              chamber consisting of an annular device which will rotate in order to generate
              Taylor vortices.  An electronic gradient is then applied along the length of
              the chamber in order to separate proteins on the basis of 
charge.  The
              potential impact of this research would be to enable the focussing and
              purification of proteins at a pH which is removed from the protein's pI and
              thereby avoiding precipitation which would otherwise occur at the pI of the
              protein.  The combination of this approach with the use of a computer
              controlled linear array of electrodes to obtain non-linear electronically
              generated electric fields will enable isoforms to be separated.
