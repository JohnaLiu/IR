Abstract    :
              The overall plan of this project is to find significant connections between the
              additive and the multiplicative structures of the integers.  In recent years
              more and the additive structure has found sophisticated uses in multiplicative
              problems, as has the the multiplicative structure been used to shed light on
              the additive structure.  In particular Professor Vaughan will consider a number
              of open problems about these related structures such as the distribution of
              general sequences in arithmetic progressions, Waring's problem, generalizations
              of the Dirichlet divisor problem and Redheffer's matrix.

This is a project
              in Number theory.  Since the beginning of science, mathematicians have studied
              the properties of the simple counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4....  Since these
              numbers can always be added, they have a strong additive structure. There are
              many applications of additive number theory to communications, probability, and
              other branches of mathematics and science.  Since the integers can be
              multiplied, they also have a multiplicative structure.  This multiplicative
              structure has been used in geometry, physics and is at the heart of most
              computer security systems. After 3000 years of study, we know a great deal
              about both of these structures.  Surprisingly much less is known about the
              interactions of these two structures.  Historically mathematicians greatest
              problems and greatest triumphs have hinged on understanding the interaction of
              addition and subtraction.
