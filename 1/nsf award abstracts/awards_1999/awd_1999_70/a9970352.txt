Abstract: Research
              will be conducted on a variety of questions concerning harmonic analysis and
              subelliptic partial differential equations on the Heisenberg and stratified
              groups, and numerous questions lying in the intersection between classical
              harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. Among the principal
              topics to be investigated are: (1) multiparameter Hardy spaces within the
              Heisenberg group and stratified groups; (2) CR-Yamabe problems on the
              Heisenberg group and Sobolev inequalities with optimal constants, including the
              classification of positive solutions and symmetry problems; (3) nonisotropic
              Sobolev spaces on the Heisenberg group and stratified groups and their
              generalizations to metric spaces (high order Sobolev spaces on metric spaces
              are fundamental to doing potential theory in non-Euclidean settings such as
              Riemannian manifolds and fractals); (4) Calderon-Zygmund  estimates for
              Schrodinger operators and their applications to nonlinear partial differential
              equations; (5) covering lemmas and their applications to partial differential
              equations and geometric analysis.

Projects conducted here cover many topics
              of current interest, most of them falling under the broad umbrella of "harmonic
              analysis" and approachable using modern variants of the classical tools of that
              subject. The quantitative and qualitative study of partial differential
              equations, one of the principal focal points of the project, constitutes a
              large part of the mathematical modeling of the physical world. Solutions of
              such equations have important applications in the physical sciences, the life
              sciences, engineering, and economics. In particular, they have applications to
              control theory and dynamical systems (e.g., the motion of objects in space
              under the influence of gravitational and other forces). Results obtained
              through the research proposed here could help to uncover new properties of
              solutions of partial differential equations, ultimately leading to a better
              understanding of the physical processes with which these equations are
              associated.
