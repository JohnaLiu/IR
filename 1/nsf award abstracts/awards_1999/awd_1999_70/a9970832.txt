Abstract    :
              This study proposes to fill the gaps in knowledge regarding the chief issues in
              systemic reform that require better theoretical specification, and the
              availability of information on the performance of the system.

It will
              address the following research questions:

1. How much reform is occurring in
              the six cases, and is there a feasible method for measuring the extent of such
              reform?
2. In each of the six cases, what has been the role of NSF's SSI in
              producing reform?
3. If reform has been occurring, what are the signs that
              student performance also is improving?

The researchers will determine how
              much statewide systemic reforming in science and mathematics education is
              occurring in five study states (Connecticut, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Texas,
              and Vermont) and one territory (Puerto Rico).  The proposed study will include
              a cross-case analysis in addition to the individual case studies to target the
              understanding of systemic reform on a broad-scale range.  The case studies will
              be based on quantitative and qualitative data collected directly from the field
              and from a variety of archival sources.
