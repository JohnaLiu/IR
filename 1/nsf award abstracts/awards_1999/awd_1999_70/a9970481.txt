This project concerns Galois covers and fundamental groups
              of affine
varieties, especially in finite characteristic.  The main goal is
              to
generalize and strengthen the result of Abhyankar's Conjecture, which
              was
proven by Raynaud and the Principal Investigator.  That result
              classified
the Galois groups of unramified covers of affine curves over
              an
algebraically closed field of finite characteristic.  By
              strengthening
this conjecture, more understanding would be achieved of how the
              Galois
covers of a given curve fit together, and thus about the structure of
              the
fundamental group.  By generalizing the conjecture, results would
              be
obtained about Galois groups over affine varieties in higher
              dimensions,
and over curves defined over more general base fields.  Methods
              will
include formal patching, specialization, cohomology, and the theory
              of
profinite groups.

The subject area of this project brings together two
              areas of mathematics
that each concern symmetry -- symmetry in algebra, in the
              case of Galois
theory; and symmetry in geometry, in the case of fundamental
              groups.  In
each of these two situations, mathematical objects can be studied
              by
examining the forms that their symmetries can take.  The
              connection
between the two settings arises from the fact that geometric spaces
              can be
described by algebraic equations, and those equations can be studied
              by
Galois theory.  The symmetries of the equations then relate to
              fundamental
groups of geometric spaces.  A problem that is posed in either of
              these
two settings can then be translated into a problem in the other
              setting,
where other techniques can be applied in order to provide a
              solution.
This project concerns how these two situations can interact, so
              that
algebra can be used in the service of geometry, and vice versa, in
              order
to study problems that would otherwise be intractable.
