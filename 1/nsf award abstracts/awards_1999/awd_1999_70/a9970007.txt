The main part of this proposal deals with the algebraic structure,
              called a conformal algebra, which is an axiomatic description of the operator
              product expansion of chiral fields in conformal field theory. The main tool
              used in the structure theory of conformal algebras is the Cartan-Lie theory of
              analytic pseudogroups.  Thus, in order to develop a structure theory of
              conformal superalgebras one needs an extension of the Cartan-Lie theory to the
              super case.  The classification of simple analytic super pseudogroups quite
              unexpectedly turned out to be very rich and beautiful.  These new objects
              require a careful study.  The work is also underway on a structure theory of
              multidimensional conformal algebras.  Other items of the proposal include
              representation theory of W_infinity type of Lie algebras, a character theory
              for affine Lie superalgebras and its connections to number theory, and the
              theory of quantum orbifolds.

There are deep reasons to believe that the new
              theory of simple super pseudogroups should play a fundamental role in further
              understanding of the Standard model, the quantum theory of electromagnetic,
              strong and weak interactions.  The theory of conformal algebras is deeply
              related to the theory of infinite-dimensinal Lie algebras and superalgebras and
              may lead to a better understanding of the operator product expansion in
              realistic quantum field theories.  The character theory of affine Lie
              superalgebras is intimately connected to some recent developments in the theory
              of modular forms.
