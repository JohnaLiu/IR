Abstract    :
              This proposal involves theoretical work on predicting spin observables in the
              photo- and electro- production of mesons.  Precision measurements of
              cross-sections and spin observables will be made at Thomas Jefferson National
              Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) and at several other facilities involving the
              elctromagnetic production of pion, eta, kaon and vector mesons.  Spin
              Observables consist of polarization, which involves predicting the direction of
              a particle's spin, and tensor polarization, which involves determining the
              probability of occupying various spin-state directions.  The availability of
              polarized photons, polarized nucleons and ability to measure the decay from the
              polarized final vector mesons open up new directions for research in strong
              interaction dynamics.  It is hoped that our theoretical work will increase
              knowledge about excited states of neutrons and protons and relate that
              information to the underlying quark model dynamics.  In addition to well-known
              mesons, we will also examine novel hybrid scalar and exotic vector mesons, for
              which there is some evidence.  The nature of those mesons and how they fit into
              Quantum Chromodynamics will be explored.
