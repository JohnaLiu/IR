Abstract    :
              Emily Carter of UCLA is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
              Program and the Materials Theory Program to develop first-principles
              descriptions of the local electronic structure of condensed matter.  Method
              development includes embedding an explicitly correlated description of the
              electronic structure of a small region into a periodic slab whose electronic
              structure is treated by solid-state physics techniques.  Quantum chemical
              methods such as perturbation theory and bulk methods such as density functional
              theory will be employed.  The embedding potential will be constructed from
              terms involving the total density of the system and the density of the embedded
              region.  A corollary project involves the development of globally accurate
              kinetic energy density functionals.  Test applications include carbon monoxide
              and oxygen atom adsorption on transition metals.

New techniques are required
              to reliably predict accurate energetics of reactions and other processes in the
              condensed phase.  While some first-principles methods such as density
              functional theory have had extraordinary success, their general applicability
              has not been proven.  This research will pursue a systematic improvement to
              density functional theory for the energetics of a localized region embedded in
              a bulk material.
