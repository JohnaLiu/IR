Abstract    :
              Theoretical studies of the interaction of ultracold atoms and ions with one
              another and with atomic mirrors and surfaces are investigated in order to
              investigate the use of cold atoms to probe fundamental atomic physics.  The
              research involves the study of the collision dynamics of these atoms at
              energies which have only recently been achieved in the laboratory and will
              impact the emerging area of atom manipulation and atom optics.
