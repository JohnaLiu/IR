Abstract    :
              The nuclear theory program at Louisiana State University is focused on
              understanding the structure of atomic nuclei, from single-particle behavior
              that validates the use of mean-field techniques to many-particle phenomena that
              manifest themselves as collective rotations and vibrations in nuclei. 
              Microscopic (shell model) and macroscopic (collective model) pictures are used
              to describe various phenomena.  Algebraic methods that employ group theoretical
               techniques, and non-linear constructions that exploit coherent state theory
              (solitons), enter into studies of excitation spectra and electromagnetic
              transition rates, especially of strongly deformed nuclei.  Agreement with data
              is the fundamental standard against which theories are tested.  Successful
              theories are used to predict results in domains where measurements have not
              been made.
