Abstract    :
              Theoretical calculations are carried out on atoms and ions of high nuclear
              charge using the techniques of many-body perturbation theory and configuration
              interaction.  In these atoms and ions it is necessary to include relativistic
              terms and to treat electron correlation effects consistently and to high order
              to obtain meaningful results.  The required numerical techniques are developed
              as part of the project.
