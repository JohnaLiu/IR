Abstract    :
              9970008
The goal of this project is to improve the performance of cathodic
              protection systems for reinforcing steel in concrete structures. Existing data
              and our current understanding of the following processes will be incorporated
              within a comprehensive three-dimensional model: (i) the electrochemical
              kinetics of iron oxidation, oxygen reduction, and water reduction at the
              concrete-rebar interface; (ii) the electrochemical kinetics of zinc anode
              oxidation, and subsequent reactions of Zn(II) at the concrete-zinc interface;
              (iii) the transport of oxygen and water through concrete; and (iv) the
              transport of ions, particularly chloride, through concrete. The model will be
              applied to investigate strategies for (i) controlling cathodic protection
              systems to protect the structure, while minimizing consumption of power,
              consumption of the anode, and generation of H2(gas); (ii) circumventing buildup
              of electrical resistance at the anode-concrete interface; (iii) facilitating
              electromechanical migration of chloride away from the rebar; (iv) protection of
              rebar in all three dimensions.
