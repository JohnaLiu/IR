Professor Rodriquez-Villegas will continue his study of
              the special values of L-functions. He will explore the recently discovered
              connection between the Mahler measure of polynomials and special values of
              L-functions.  Mahler measure appears in many fascinating and seemingly
              unrelated contexts like heights of varieties in Arakelov theory, transcendental
              number theory, entropy of algebraic dynamical systems, and spectrum of discrete
              operators. In this project Professor Rodriquez-Villegas will try to use our
              understanding of Mahler measure of polynomials and this new relation to special
              values of L-functions to shed light on the conjectures of Bolch and
              Beilinson.

This is a project in modern Number Theory.  The study of the
              basic properties of the natural numbers has long been a part of mathematics. 
              Our ever-increasing understanding of these basic properties has led to
              ingenious practical and theoretical applications of the familiar number systems
              well beyond mathematics. Many of the basic properties of numbers can be
              summarized into number themselves by counting certain collections of important
              objects.  Unfortunately many times these collections are much too difficult to
              actually count.  Mathematicians have discovered that many of the important
              counts can be found by encoding information into certain L-functions that can
              be constructed via calculus.  Some special values of these L-functions give the
              answers they are looking for.  By studying these special values, Professor
              Rodriquez-Villegas hopes to establish estimates of the numbers that will shed
              light on the important properties they summarize.
