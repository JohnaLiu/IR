The primary focus of this proposal is on the representations of
              Lie
algebras, Lie groups, Lie superalgebras, quantum enveloping
algebras,
              Hopf algebras, and associative
algebras of operators on combinatorial
              structures.
The specific topics to be investigated are 
(1) down-up algebras
              (which generalize the algebras
coming from the down and up operators 
on
              partially ordered sets, graphs, association schemes etc.); 
(2) commuting
              actions; (3) Lie algebras
graded by finite root systems; (4) quantum
              structures
related to Lie and Jordan algebras; (5) crystal bases; 
(6)
              Hochschild cohomology and Clifford theory.
 Much of the impetus to study these
              subjects
comes from their close connections with combinatorics,  
invariant
              theory, group theory, ring theory, 
and solvable lattice models in
              mathematics, and spin models,
soliton equations, and conformal field theory in
              physics.



This proposal seeks to understand certain sets
having a
              partial order (one object in the set 
may be less than another or the objects
              may not be related).
The down operator maps an object to the ones directly
              below 
it and the up operator maps it to the ones directly above it.
Such
              operators play an important role in physics,
where they termed annihilation
              and creation operators.
The investigations will focus on the
              combinatorics
and algebraic properties of these operators and
              various
generalizations of them.  Also to be studied are symmetries 
and
              their related mathematics.  This is an area that 
has had an enormous impact
              on particle physics, 
the study of crystals in chemistry, and mathematical
              
research ever since the pioneering work of mathematician 
Issai Schur and 
              physicist Hermann Weyl.  Its continuing 
vitality is evidenced by much current
              activity 
and many open problems.  For example, crystal
bases correspond to
              absolute zero temperature in
solvable lattice models in physics. Such
              bases
have remarkable properties.  One typical 
problem to be addressed is to
              construct such bases
when the symmetry operators exhibit certain behavior.
