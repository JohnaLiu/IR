Abstract    :
              Noise has traditionally been thought of as a "Nuisance" that interferes with the
              "interesting" or "intrinsic" behavior of physical systems.  That this limited
              view misses the instrumental ways in which noise can actually enhance and even
              cause desirable behaviors has become quite clear in the past two decades, but
              the ways in which this can occur are still grounds for fertile investigation. 
              In this project we focus on one such dramatic phenomenon, that of noise-induced
              phase transitions in spatially extended systems.  These are macroscopic
              transitions where the noise not only causes the system to go from one phase to
              another, but where the very existence of the phases is predicated on the
              presence of the noise; in its absence the system can only exist in one phase. 
              The investigations will attempt to systematically explore the basic features
              that lead to noise-induced phase transitions, the interplay of these
              transitions with noise-induced signal enhancement phenomena such as stochastic
              resonance, the control and adaptability of design parameters to produce
              noise-induced phases with desired properties, and the development of
              user-friendly interfaces that allow visualization of spatially distributed
              noisy nonlinear systems.
