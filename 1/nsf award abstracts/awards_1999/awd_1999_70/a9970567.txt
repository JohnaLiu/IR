The mechanics of drop breakup and
              coalescence in complex fluids and the anisotropic microstructure in shearing
              polymeric suspensions of rigid particles will be investigated.  The
              viscoelastic behavior of the polymeric liquids and the area of relevance in
              polymer material processing connect these topics.   Experimental studies in a
              four-roll mill will be performed with a microscale PIV system for various
              polymeric blends in order to quantify and understand the mechanisms that
              control the drop size distribution in a blending process of non-Newtonian
              fluids, and the effect of the compatibilizers that act as surfactants.  The
              long particle chains aligned to the flow direction of uniform and bidisperse
              particle systems in polymeric fluid flow will be studied as a function of the
              rheological properties, particle size, concentration, and shear rate of the
              mean flow.  Tracer particles in a matched index of refraction suspension will
              be recorded in a Couette device.  
The proposed research has relevance to
              polymeric material processing and its optimization.
