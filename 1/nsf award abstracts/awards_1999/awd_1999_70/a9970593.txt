Kenneth Ribet intends to continue his work on the number theory
              associated with modular forms, modular curves, abelian varieties and Galois
              groups.  Ribet is especially interested in number fields arising from torsion
              points on abelian varieties.  While many questions in this subject are
              technical in nature, they are ultimately rooted in the classical problem of
              finding all whole number or fractional solutions to a family of
              equations.

Kenneth Ribet studies the arithmetic of modular forms, Galois
              representations and abelian varieties.  His research lies at the intersection
              of algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory, two flourishing fields of
              mathematics.  Ribet is best known for his contribution to the proof of Fermat's
              Last Theorem:  Ribet proved a technical result about Galois representations,
              sometimes known as Serre's epsilon conjecure, which relates Fermat's Last
              Theorem to the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture for elliptic curves.  More recently,
              Ribet contributed to the proof of a Fermat's conjecture to the effect that
              three distinct positive perfect n'th powers (where n is bigger than 2) can
              never form an arithmetic progression.
