Abstract    :
              

The proposed research is to study nonlinear optical properties of various
              organic dyes, e.g. phthalocyanine and polymethine dyes, asymmetric
              fluorene-based dyes and polydiacetylenes,  by using a special spectrophotometer
              built by the group.  The non-linear spectra of semiconductor and dielectric
              materials have been studied in the past by this technique, and the results are
              very useful.  The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive capability for the
              nonlinear optical properties in terms of the linear optical properties and/or
              molecular structures of organic materials.
