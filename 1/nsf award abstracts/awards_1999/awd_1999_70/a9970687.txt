ABSTRACT

In this proposal, the PI considers problems in the
              theory of partial 
differential equations suggested by the interplay of ideas
              in 
nonlinear elasticity, image interpolation, control theory
and  classical
              function theory.  Recent developments in image interpolation and
nonlinear
              elasticity can be formulated as extension problems
for functions that have
              bounded derivatives. Typically, a function
is known  only  on a  subset  of
              its domain of definition.
The problem is to interpolate or extend it to the
              whole domain
maintaining the maximum possible regularity. This extension
              is
obtained  by solving an elliptic boundary value problem.
The solution of
              these problems by standard elliptic partial
differential equations, including
              the Laplacian, always 
results in a loss of regularity at the boundary.  
To
              preserve the boundedness of the derivatives it
is necessary  to use nonlinear
              elliptic equations that are highly
degenerate, whose mathematical theory has
              just begun to
be understood. The prototype of these operators is the
              so
called "infinite-Laplacian". 

In many problems in physics and
              engineering one has to minimize
the average of  a quadratic energy. The
              equations so obtained
are linear and are useful to describe small
              perturbations in
many cases. To describe large deviations, often one has
              to
consider nonlinear equations corresponding to non-quadratic
energies. If
              we try to minimize the
maximum of the energy, say to find out where   is the
              maximum
voltage or stress, the resulting equations are of a very
nonlinear
              nature that requires a different mathematical
treatment than in the
              traditional linear theory. The PI proposes
to continue the development of the
              basic theory of these equations.
Among the possible applications we have image
              interpolation,
one of the basic operation in image processing, and
              
non-linear elasticity.
