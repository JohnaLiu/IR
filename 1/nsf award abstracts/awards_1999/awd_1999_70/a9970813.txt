Abstract: The principal investigators and colleagues have organized
              the 15th Southeastern Analysis Meeting. The conference will be held at
              Vanderbilt University in conjunction with the annual Shanks Lectures, which
              will be delivered in 1999 by Professor William Arveson of the University of
              California at Berkeley. There will be nine plenary speakers at the meeting, all
              of whom are well-known mathematicians in analysis. The conference will have
              special sessions in operator algebras, operator theory, and harmonic analysis.
              The scientific purpose of the conference is to stimulate research in modern
              analysis and classical analysis. 

The objective of the conference is to
              bring together not only established and new researchers, but also advanced
              graduate students who have begun exploring the subject. A major aim of the
              conference is to involve young researchers and to help them establish their
              research goals and directions. The participation of recent Ph.D. recipients and
              graduate students is a substantial part of the conference program. The
              scientific and educational significance of the conference is evidenced by the
              wide range of research topics presented, the diverse participation of
              researchers from mathematics departments, and the active participation of
              graduate students.
