     The investigator will continue his study of the
              relationships between large cardinals, determinacy, descriptive set theory, and
              forcing axioms.  The focus of his project is the fine structure of determinacy
              and its metamathematical consequences concerning the Continuum Hypothesis.

 
                 Is every infinite set of points in the line either countable, i.e.,
              equinumerous with the integers, or else equinumerous with the set of all points
              in the line?  This is Cantor's continuum problem.  Modern set theory began 35
              years ago with P.J. Cohen's proof that Cantor's continuum problem was
              unsolvable on the basis of the customary axioms of set theory.

     Axioms
              of Infinity were proposed by Goedel 50 years ago as candidates for new axioms
              that solve otherwise unsolvable problems.  The results of 30 years of research
              have domonstrated that this is true for the classical problems of descriptive
              set theory.  In particular, the theory of the projective sets (the ``true''
              axioms for second order number theory) is now arguably settled.  The nature of
              Cohen's proof is such that this success cannot be directly repeated for
              Cantor's continuum problem. Nevertheless, recent results indicate progress can
              be achieved, for these results suggest a key asymmetry concerning potential
              solutions to the continuum problem.  The implications of this asymmetry, and
              the technology behind this discovery, are the main topics for the research to
              be undertaken.
