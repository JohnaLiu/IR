Title: New
              Debugging Techniques for One-Way, Dataflow Constraints

One-way, dataflow
              constraints are spreadsheet-like constraints that have found uses in a variety
              of applications, including graphical interfaces, programming environments, and
              circuit simulation. However, there is considerable evidence that one-way
              constraints are difficult to debug. The research focuses on developing a number
              of techniques to alleviate this problem, including: 1) Visualization techniques
              that allow programmers to examine the flow of information through the
              constraint system, 2) Incremental debugging techniques that will allow
              programmers to single-step through the constraint solving process, and 3)
              Explanation-based techniques that will allow the debugger to record significant
              events during the solving process and then analyze these events to help the
              programmer pinpoint the source of a bug. Better debugging and visualization
              techniques will have a number of significant benefits, including greater
              productivity among constraint users, greater reliability for applications, and
              greater acceptance for constraints outside the research and spreadsheet
              communities.
