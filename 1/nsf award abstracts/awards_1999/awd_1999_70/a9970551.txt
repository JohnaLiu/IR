Starchenko
     S. Starchenko will continue his research in the field
              of
model theory.  He intends to study structures definable in
o-minimal
              models, and he will also attempt to extend some recent
results about Pfaffian
              functions to o-minimal expansions of real
closed fields.
     One of the main
              goals of this research is developing a theory
of analytic functions over
              arbitrary algebraically closed fields
(fields in which all polynomial
              equations in one variable have
solutions) analogous to the theory of complex
              analytic functions.
S. Starchenko strongly believes that many classical
              theorems of
complex analysis can also be proved in the category of
              ``tame
analytic'' functions over such fields.  Understanding which
              theorems
are available in this general context and which are not would
              shed
light on the classical theory itself; the new perspective would be
made
              to provide more insight into a highly developed and venerable
classical
              theory.
