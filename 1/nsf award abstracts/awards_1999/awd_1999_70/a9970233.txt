Abstract

	This projects involves the establishment of a biorobotic
              functional genomics screening facility at University of California, Irvine
              (UCI).  The primary objectives of this proposal are (i) identification of
              interacting molecules; and (ii) automation of cell transfections and cell
              culture based arrays.  A cDNA array will be automatically replicated and DNA
              extracted and protein produced by a coupled transcription/translation reaction
              (TNT).  Pools of proteins produced by TNT will be tested for interaction with
              target molecules (other proteins, DNA or small molecules) using a scintillation
              proximity assay (SPA) in 394 well microtitre plates.  For cell based assays,
              pools of cDNA clones will be transfected into cells engineered with reporter
              constructs (pooling, cell culture and transfection will all be done
              robotically).  The equipment requested includes a robotic workstation, high
              density microtitre plate scintillation counter, a microtitre plate reader and
              associated robot friendly items.  The advantages of automation include (i)
              increased sensitivity, i.e. a higher degree of quantitation and reproducibility
              not attainable manually; (ii) higher capacity i.e. high throughput (100-250,000
              cDNA clones) also not attainable manually; (iii) new capabilities, i.e. the
              ability to detect interactions impossible or impractical with other
              methodologies; and (iv) once set up, the system will be low cost and rapid
              compared to other methods.

	When in place, this facility will represent
              cutting edge technology to perform tasks that will advance many projects at UCI
              and elsewhere.  It will also provide a base system from which to explore
              development of new technologies in conjunction with other groups such as the
              biomedical engineering group at UCI.
