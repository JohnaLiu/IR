NSF-CNPq
              Collaborative Research on Classification Methodologies Applied to Aerial
              Imagery for Environmental Monitoring and Urban Planning

This proposal is for
              a  collaborative effort between the University of Massachusetts (UMass)
              Computer Science Department in the US, and the University of Sao-Paulo at Sao
              Carlos (USP) in Brazil within the NSF-CNPq Collaborative Research
              Opportunities.   Our proposed collaboration involves the development and
              evaluation of classification methodologies applied to aerial image
              interpretation..The proposal will address two application domains.

         
                 (a) Environmental Monitoring-classification of vegetation species to
              determine the state of the                          environment, land use,
              change detection, etc.  This project will be conducted in partnership with     
                              Conservation International (CI) which has an important ongoing
              environmental project in the state of               Bahia, Brazil.

         
                (b) Urban Planning-determination of functional categories in cultural areas,
              including the                                classification of buildings,
              roads, parking lots, fields, lakes, rivers, ponds, etc.
