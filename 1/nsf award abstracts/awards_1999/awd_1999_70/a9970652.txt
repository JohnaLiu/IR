Dr. Brainerd is conducting a conference titled "Gravitational
              lensing: recent progress and future goals."  The field of gravitational lensing
              is quite active. The field touches many subdisciplines in astronomy.  This
              conference  will discuss the implications of recent investigations as well as
              possible future developments.  The conference format will consist of 45 minute
              invited review talks, 30 minute targeted talks, 20 minute contributed talks, as
              well as contributed poster presentations.  Proceedings of the meeting will be
