Abstract

The investigator is continuing his research into the
              behavior of
wave propagation in nonhomogeneous media with "rough" wave
              speeds.
The goal is to obtain estimates of Strichartz and nullform type
on
              solutions to variable coefficient wave equations under
minimal
              differentiability assumptions on the coefficients.
Under current NSF funding,
              the investigator has shown that
the Strichartz estimates hold if the curvature
              tensor of the wave
speed metric is bounded and measurable. The proposed
              research
includes extending these results to obtain estimates for
              bilinear
null-forms of solutions, as well as estimates for eigenfunctions
of
              the Laplacian on spaces with bounded curvature. The investigator
is also
              involved in joint work studying the Strichartz and bilinear
nullform estimates
              for waves which reflect from convex obstacles.
Previous joint research has
              obtained such estimates in bounded 
regions of space-time. The proposed
              research involves combining these 
local methods with known energy decay
              estimates to obtain such
estimates valid globally in space and time. These
              results are then
being applied to establish long time existence for certain
              nonlinear
wave equations on the region exterior to a convex obstacle.

The
              development of techniques to handle partial differential equations
with low
              regularity coefficients is of both theoretical and practical
interest. The
              theoretical interest comes from the study of
nonlinear equations in math and
              physics, such as Einstein's equations
for the gravitational field, or the
              equations of fluid dynamics. 
A central question for such equations is the
              "long time" existence
of solutions; that is, showing that solutions do not
              blow up
at some future time. The main technique for doing this is to
              show
that one can control the size of the nonlinear part of the equation
in
              terms of quantities that are known to remain controlled, such
as the energy of
              the solution. For Einstein's equations, this
requires understanding the wave
              equation with rough wave speeds.
The practical importance of such studies is
              that a theoretical
understanding of the propagation of waves in rough media
              should
lead to more efficient algorithms for the numerical computation
of
              solutions. Our work involves splitting the solution into
elementary pieces,
              each of which behaves in a particularly simple
manner. This is analogous to
              the decomposition of functions into
wavelets, much of the modern theory of
              which was developed to
understood nonlinear equations of stable-state
              phenomena. Wavelets
have in turn led to simple and stable algorithms for
              solving such 
equations, as well as to powerful algorithms in the fields of
              image
and signal processing.
