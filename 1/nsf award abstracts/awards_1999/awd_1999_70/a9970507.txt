Abstract    :
              	Quantum information consists of qubits rather than bits.  A qubit is a
              two-level quantum system where the levels represent 0 and 1.  Unlike a
              classical bit, it can exist in a superposition of 0 and 1, and this property
              makes novel kinds of information processing possible.  Proposed applications
              are quantum cryptography, superdense coding, and quantum computing. Qubits can
              be processed by devices as a quantum gates.  A universal quantum device is one
              whose performance does not depend on the input state.  An example, which has
              all ready been studied, is a quantum copier, which produces two imperfect
              copies of an input qubit.  Other universal devices are a universal NOT gate, a
              universal entangler, a universal disentangler, and a universal transposer.  All
              of these devices should be relatively simple and able to be realized by a small
              number of quantum gates.  Multilevel and continuous systems can also be used to
              represent quantum information.  Squeezed states can be used as the basis of
              quantum cryptographic protocol which would allow amplifiers to be used to
              overcome transmission losses.
