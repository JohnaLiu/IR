Abstract    :
              This proposal is a renewal for the award ECS-9421517, "Semiconductor Physics and
              Photonics".  The PI has played a significant role in the pioneering work and
              made important discoveries regarding the normal-mode coupling in semiconductor
              microcavities.  This renewal proposal is aimed to extend the previous
              accomplishment toward quantum limit of the micro-cavity where a strong coupling
              exists that can produce a change in the absorption by a single photon.  All
              semiconductor microcavities to date have operated in  the semi-classical regime
              where 105 photons are required.  Although interesting optical non-linearity can
              be obtained in such a system, the quantum effects analogous to atomic cavity
              quantum electrodynamics has not been observed.  In this proposal the PI
              suggests to fabricate and analyze transversely confined microcavities with ~100
              nm diameters that will enable the quantum regime to be achieved in the
              semiconductor system.
