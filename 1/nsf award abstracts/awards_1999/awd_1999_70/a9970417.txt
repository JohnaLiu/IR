	Professor Wan will continue
              his study of the p-adic of L-functions arising from algebraic geometry over a
              finite field of characteristic p.  The central problem in this study is a 1973
              conjecture of Dwork about the p-adic continuation of the L function of a unit
              root F-chrystal. Prof. Wan will try to establish the general validity of this
              conjecture.  He will also investigate the arithmetic consequences of the
              conjecture including higher dimensional generalizations of the Gouvea-Mazur
              conjecture, and the zeros of certain geometric L-functions, and the connections
              with the mysterious mirror map that arises from a family of Calabi-Yau
              varieties.

	This is a project in number theory and algebraic geometry.  One
              of mathematics oldest branches, number theory is the study of numbers that can
              be expressed exactly in terms of the simplest counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 
              In the second half of this century, modern geometry has had a tremendous impact
              on number theory introducing  new methods and new problems.  The development of
              algebraic geometry has paralleled advances in number theory for the past 30
              years. Professor Wan will study geometric objects defined over the simplest
              possible mathematical basis for such a geometry, a finite field.  These are
              simultaneously the simplest and most intriguing objects in algebraic geometry.
              They have found very practical application in communications, security, and
              other surprising areas.
