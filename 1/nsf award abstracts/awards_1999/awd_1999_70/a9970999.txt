This grant supports theoretical research in condensed matter
              theory.  The focus of the research is to enhance our current understanding of
              interference phenomena in metals and superconductors.  Systems to be studied
              include adiabatic charge transport in mesoscopic metals; mesoscopic effects in
              superconductors and superconductor-normal metal junctions; and, mesoscopic
              effects in ferromagnet-nonferromagnet metal junctions.

This grant
              supports theoretical research in condensed matter theory.  The focus of the
              research is to enhance our current understanding of interference phenomena in
              metals and superconductors.  These materials and junctions formed from them
              display a range of novel phenomena on the mesoscale - between the atomic and
              large scales.  These phenomena are of interest for fundamental reasons and yet
              have potential applications in devices.
