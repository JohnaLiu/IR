Advancing Human Language Technology in Brazil and the United States
              Through Collaborative Research on Spoken Language Systems

	This is the first
              year funding of a two-year continuing award.  This project entails
              collaborative research and technology transfer leading to a Brazilian
              Portuguese version of the CSLU Speech Toolkit, an integrated software platform
              for learning about, researching and developing spoken language systems.  We
              will mentor researchers from two universities in Brazil via collaborative
              workshops/training sessions and collaborate to advance the state-of-the-art of
              spoken language technology.  Our goal is to extend the toolkit's capabilities
              to include Brazilian Portuguese speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis
              and use these technologies to develop systems for information access and
              language training.  This will entail creation of suitable language resources
              (lexicons, corpora), development of software infrastructure, and basic research
              to improve the underlying technology.  We will then share our knowledge,
              software, and language resources by distributing the toolkit and language
              resources at no cost to academic institutions throughout the United States and
              Brazil to spur growth in this area of research and, in the long term, improve
              access to information by the citizens of both Brazil and the U.S.
