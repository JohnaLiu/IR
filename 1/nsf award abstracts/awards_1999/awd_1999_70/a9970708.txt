The behavior of several different types of ultra-small
              condensed matter systems will be investigated.  One set of experiments will
              study electronic motion in metals such as the behavior of magnetic impurities
              in small metal systems, the electrical resistance of magnetic domains and
              domain walls in very narrow ferromagnetic wires, and electron phase coherence
              times at very low temperatures. A second body of work will investigate the
              motion of fluids in very small structures. New methods for the fabrication of
              fluid "containers" as small as a few hundred angstroms on a side will be
              developed to obtain information on the nature of viscous flow at extremely
              short length scales. The central theme of this work is the use of ultra-small
              structures as tools with which to study fundamental issues in condensed matter
              physics.

This project will study several different types of ultra-small
              systems.  One set of experiments will explore electronic motion in metals, with
              particular attention to how this motion is affected by the magnetic properties
              of the metal. Another body of work will develop new methods for the fabrication
              of fluid "containers" as small as a hundred atomic diameters on a side.  These
              will be used to investigate atomistic effects on the flow of simple fluids. The
              central theme of this work is the use of ultra-small structures as tools with
              which to study fundamental issues in condensed matter physics.
