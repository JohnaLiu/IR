Abstract    :
              This proposal continues investigations into groups of rational points of simple
              algebraic groups over number fields and of their S-arithmetic subgroups. One of
              the goals of the project is to prove the centrality of the congruence kernel
              for new classes of groups.  In conjunction with the previous results of
              G.Prasad and A.Rapinchuk describing the metaplectic kernel, this will provide a
              definitive answer to the congruence subgroup problem for these groups. The PI
              will also study the rigidity property for finite dimensional representations of
              finitely generated groups in order to prove that discrete Kazhdan groups have
              finite representation type. 

This research lies in the  meeting ground
              between algebra and number theory.  Questions related to the normal subgroup
              structure of linear groups have historical roots in the previous century
              (Jordan, Klein), and have been an area of active research in this century.  In
              the last 10-15 years tools have been developed to study a central problem about
              arithmetic subgroups of algebraic groups. This problem, known as the congruence
              subgroup problem, is connected with other fundamental problems in number theory
              for which new applications are being discovered  in such areas as data
              transmission, data processing, and communication systems.
