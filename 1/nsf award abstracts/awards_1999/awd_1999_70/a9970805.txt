Abstract    :
              A deep wide field weak lensing and photometric survey

Nicholas Kaiser

Dr.
              Kaiser is performing a deep, multi-color, wide area photometric survey that
              covers approximately 13.5 square degrees complete to a magnitude of 26.  He is
              using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and also the University of
              Hawaii 88 inch telescope.  The instrument used is a new 12Kx8K CCD camera built
              for the CHFT.  These data will provide a measure of the gravitational lensing
              effect on the shapes of the faint background galaxies at redshifts between 1
              and 3.  The shapes of these galaxies are used to generate a map of the
              gravitational shear field; i.e., the projected tidal field of foreground
              structures. The power spectrum and auto-correlation of this shear field
              provides estimates of the primordial mass fluctuation on large scales.
