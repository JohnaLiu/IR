     This award will provide partial support for speakers and
              others
at the Conference on ``Topology, Geometry and Algebra:
              Interactions
and New Directions'' to be held at Stanford University from
              August 17
to August 21, 1999.  The aim of this conference is to
              promote
interaction between algebraic topology on the one hand and
              several
extremely active areas of application of topology on the other. 
              The
areas of application will include differential geometry, moduli
              spaces,
symplectic topology, representation theory, and discrete group
              theory.
The organizers have in mind interaction in two directions,
              both
applications of topology to other areas and applications of other
areas
              of mathematics to topology.  The conference is particularly
timely, since such
              interaction is well begun, and they view their role
as encouraging it and
              helping to broaden and deepen it.  The conference
will consist entirely of 22
              plenary lectures and will permit ample
time for discussions among
              participants.  The organizers expect
participation by between 75 and 100
              mathematicians. They have invited a
number of younger mathematicians as well
              as graduate students, and three
of the featured speakers are women.  A
              conference proceedings, to be
edited by A. Adem, R. Cohen and G. Carlsson,
              will be published as a
volume in Contemporary Mathematics.
