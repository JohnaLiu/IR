Abstract    :
              Stepping stones to the Universe: DIRECT distances to the M31 and the M33
              galaxies

Dimitar D. Sasselov

Dr. Sasselov is conducting a project called
              DIRECT.  This project uses detached eclipsing binaries and Cepheids to refine
              the distances to two important galaxies in the cosmological distance ladder. 
              Microlensing searches are now finding detached eclipsing binaries.  Dr.
              Sasselov is extending these searches to include the two main Local Group
              galaxies visible in the northern sky, M31 and M33. 

These two nearby
              galaxies are stepping stones for most of our current efforts to understand the
              evolving universe at large scales.  They are essential to the calibration of
              the extragalactic distance scale. They constrain population synthesis models
              for early galaxy formation and evolution and provide the stellar luminosity
              calibration.
