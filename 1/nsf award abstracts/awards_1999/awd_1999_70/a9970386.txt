The proposed project concerns zeroes of L-functions.  We
              intend to investigate the fine structure of these zeroes for families of
              L-functions.  They are intimately connected to random matrix theory and
              symmetry groups, and for certain families,  arithmetical questions such as
              ranks of Abelian varieties.  Some of what we set out to establish has been
              discovered through computer experiments.

Our general area of research is
              number theory and related topics.  Also entering into these works are some
              ideas from mathematical physics, in particular symmetry properties and
              universalities associated with random matrix ensembles.
