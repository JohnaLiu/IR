Abstract    :
              ROTA/DERKSEN, 9970165

The proposer plans to investigate problems in the areas
              of constructive invariant theory, generalized quivers associated to reductive
              groups and automorphisms of affine spaces. In the first case  the
              proposer
will refine his algorithm for computing reductive group invariants;
              in the second, with Weyman, apply quiver representations to reductive groups;
              in the last case look at automorphisms of affine space over the complex
              numbers. 

The theory of reductive groups aids in studying various  symmetry
              properties of space from an algebraic point of view. Applications are to be
              found in chemistry and physics.
