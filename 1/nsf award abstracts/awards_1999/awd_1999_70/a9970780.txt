Dr. Bershady
              will carry out an observational program that consists of two surveys that map
              and calibrate the evolution of mass/light ratio from nearby to distant spirals.
               The first survey uses emission line rotation curves and velocity maps. 
              Offsets from the Tully-Fisher relation between rotation speed and luminosity
              will be used as one measure of change in M/L.  The second survey will obtain
              disk kinematics of stars and ionized gas through velocity maps of a
              representative subset of galaxies at low to intermediate redshifts. The data
              will be obtained with a two dimensional fiber optic array on the Hobby Eberly
              Telescope and the WIYN Telescope.
