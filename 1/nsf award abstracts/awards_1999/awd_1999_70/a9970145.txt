Funds are requested to purchase equipment that will be
              used for cell growth and harvesting.  This equipment will be used by 10
              research groups on the central campus of the University of Michigan. The
              projects that will utilize this equipment address diverse aspects of
              biochemistry and biophysics, but are primarily focused on mechanistic
              enzymology and protein structure/function studies.  Two fermentors will be
              purchased.  A small fermentor will be used for preparing isotopically labelled
              proteins while a large fermentor will be used by projects that require large
              volume growths, typically for spectroscopic experiments.  Most of the projects
              will benefit from both fermentors.  In addition, a continuous flow centrifuge
              and a French press will be purchased for isolation and lysing cells.  This
              equipment is urgently needed and not presently available.
