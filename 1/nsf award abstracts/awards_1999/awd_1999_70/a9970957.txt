Abstract    :

The investigator plans to continue her research in combinatorics on
              partially ordered sets, expanding it further in the direction of relations with
              algebra, topology, and geometry.  The proposed work emerges from the
              investigator's increased awareness of relations between her work on the lattice
              of noncrossing partitions and aspects of algebraic combinatorics.  Using
              techniques of structural and algebraic combinatorics, she considers two main
              lines of investigation:  determinants from combinatorial statistics on
              partially ordered sets and topological aspects of partially ordered
              sets.

This project is motivated by compelling evidence that the time is
              propitious for seeking a suitable unification of a number of significant
              independent problems.  The investigator encountered striking similarities among
              a number of results, proofs, and conjectures obtained by a variety of
              researchers working in different areas of mathematics -- low-dimensional
              topology, geometry, mathematical physics, combinatorics.  These constitute a
              critical mass of deep and diverse problems, indicating that the similarities
              are not mere coincidences.  Thus, and overarching goal is to make progress
              toward understanding the combinatorics underlying these problems and the
              reasons for their similarity.
