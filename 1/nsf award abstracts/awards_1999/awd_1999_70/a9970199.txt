Computational Laboratory for the
              Development of new Approaches to Complex Biological Phenomena


A
              computational biology center will extend modeling and computation to real
              biological processes especially in the area of molecular biophysics, molecular
              genetics, developmental control and evolution.  The three primary research
              projects concentrate on protein folding and simulation, modeling Dictyostelium
              development and hybridization and folding of nucleic acids.  Current
              methodologies of MonteCarlo, stochastic automata and dynamic programming will
              be used.  New simulation concepts will lead to a better understanding of the
              complicated issues involved in making quantitatively valid predictions for
              biological systems. This broadly based facility will advance the field of
              computational biology, which is becoming increasingly necessary for biologists
              to keep track of and make sense of data of ever increasing complexity.
