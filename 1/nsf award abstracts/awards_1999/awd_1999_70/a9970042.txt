Abstract: The
              proposed research will be concerned with a number of topics in Fourier 
              analysis related to singular integral operators, Fourier integral operators
              with degenerate canonical relations, Radon transforms, averages over curves and
              surfaces and associated maximal functions, regularity of wave propagation,
              spectral multipliers on noncompact manifolds, and the multitude of
              interrelations between these topics.

The subject of Fourier analysis has
              provided powerful tools for various areas of mathematics and its applications.
              The P.I. proposes to develop further and refine some of these tools. This
              should lead to a better qualitative understanding of integral operators that
              arise in the study of partial differential equations from mathematical physics,
              as well as in the study of integral geometry and tomography. The potential
              concrete implications of improving this understanding are enormous. Tomography,
              for instance, not only provides the mathematical foundation for the
              reconstruction methods that are employed constantly in medical imaging but also
              furnishes the key to interpreting seismic data, lending it a "real world"
              significance that cannot be overstated.
