This award supports a series of projects in the related areas of
              polymer physics and biophysics, all of which capitalize on the utilization of
              techniques involving controlling molecular motion with laser tweezers and
              optical imaging of biological polymers.  Inherent in the work is a focus on the
              extraction of details of  the behavior of polymers from the analysis of single
              molecules.  All measurements will be accompanied by the development of new
              experimental tools which extend the present capabilities of instruments. 
              Projects will include, among others, the study of polymers in shear and
              elongational flows, Brownian motion of polymers in solution, and combining
              fluorescence resonance energy transfer with observation with an atomic force
              microscope.  Funding for this award is provided by the Atomic, Molecular,
              Optical, and Plasma Physics program in the Physics Division, the Polymers
              program in the Division of Materials Research, and the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
              Directorate and the Molecular Biophysics program in the Division of Molecular
              and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.
