Abstract:
              McNeal will consider several problems which deal with the connection between
              the complex analysis on a domain in a multi-dimensional manifold and the
              geometry of its boundary. The research in this project centers on the existence
              and regularity for operators associated with partial differential equations on
              such domains and manifolds. There are three main, related problems on which the
              project will focus: (1) global regularity of some perturbations on the Kohn
              laplacian on a general, smoothly bounded, pseudoconvex domain; (2) the
              vanishing of the square-integrable cohomology in the Bergman metric on a
              pseudoconvex domain; and (3) the existence of solution operators to the
              Cauchy-Riemann equations which are bounded in Lebesgue and Holder
              spaces.

This project will explore ways that solutions to partial
              differential equations are affected by the shape of the region where the
              equations are defined. Partial differential equations are the main tools used
              to model all physical processes; e.g., flow of heat in a material, propogation
              of sound and light, lift over an airfoil. Understanding how to solve these
              equations and the ways that solutions depend on the form of the equations
              continues to be of fundamental importance both in the development of new
              technology and for the extension of current theories underlying physics,
              chemistry, and biology. The hope is that McNeal's project will contribute in a
              significant way to this understanding.
