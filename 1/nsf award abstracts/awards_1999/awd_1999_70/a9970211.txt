This award will support the purchase of a
              MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer for use in the analysis of high molecular weight
              biomolecules.  There are seven major users of this equipment.  Projects include
              the study of coiled coil interactions and protein-lipid interactions, studies
              on phosphatases and sulfatases, catalytic RNAs, gas phase biomolecule
              conformations, RNA transcription, human eotaxin, and viral RNA polymerases. 
              All the major users have extensive requirements for mass spectrometry of
              biomolecules ranging from relatively low molecular weight peptides to proteins
              in the molecular weight range of 100 kD.  The equipment to be purchased with
              this award will meet the needs of the users in providing high-resolution
              capabilities for proteins and nucleic acids and MS-MS capability for peptide
              sequencing.  The instrument will also be used for mass spectrometry of
              relatively small biomolecules that are highly charged.
