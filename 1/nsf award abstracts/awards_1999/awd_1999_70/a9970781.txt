Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical particle physics will focus on experimental consequences
              of theories that describe the fundamental interactions of nature. Special
              emphasis will be placed on the properties of heavy quarks, the phenomenology of
              possible extra spatial dimensions that are of submillimeter size, and the
              implications of supersymmetry. This symmetry relates the particles that "carry"
              the forces to the ones that are the constituents of matter.  The results of the
              research will further our  understanding of the fundamental interactions.
