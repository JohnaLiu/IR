This collaborative project with the Institute of Systems
              Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences focuses on four goals: 1) expanding
              knowledge of energy-efficiency improvements, 2) refining current and new
              analytical tools, 3) integrating estimates of industrial energy-efficiency and
              pollution generation with in-depth examinations of regional sustainable
              development issues, and 4) determining regional economic impact implications of
              the use of alternative technologies.  Work in the first two years will focus on
              the coke-making sector of Shanxi Province.  The Chinese counterpart is Prof.
              Chen Xikang of the Department of Operations Research and Management.
