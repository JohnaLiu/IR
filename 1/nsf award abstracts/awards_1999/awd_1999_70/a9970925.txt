              Analysis, and Testing of Scenario-based Requirements

Scenario-based
              specifications such as message sequence charts offer an intuitive and visual
              way of describing design requirements. Such specifications focus on message
              exchanges among communicating entities in distributed software systems. Recent
              standardization of syntax and semantics (MSC'96 or Z.120) by ITU and
              integration into modern object-oriented software engineering methodologies such
              as UML, lead us to believe that scenario-based specifications will play an
              increasingly important role in design of concurrent systems. This research aims
              to develop new language features, methodologies, analysis techniques, and tools
              for effective use of scenario-based requirements in software design.  We
              propose to pursue two complementary research directions. The first goal is to
              develop new techniques to employ scenario-based requirements for automatic
              validation. For this purpose, we will develop algorithms for model checking and
              test-case generation based on specifications given by message sequence charts.
              The second goal is to develop new constructs to allow specification of complex
              behaviors. For this purpose, we will investigate constructors that are
              particularly suitable for abstraction, and for specification of mixed
              discrete-continuous behaviors. We propose to investigate foundational research
              questions related to the above issues,  and develop an integrated toolkit for
              specification, analysis, and testing of scenario-based requirements.
