              Abstract
Ocneanu

Ocneanu will investigate three classes of problems.  The
              first class to be investigated concern the general discrete structure behind
              the rigidity results of finite depth subfactors; the second class of problems
              concerns the introduction and use of the new technical tools for subfactors
              such as the maximal atlas, the generalized intermediate subfactors and the
              modular matrices associated to a subfactor; and the third class of problems
              concerns the detailed study of concrete classes of examples such as the maximal
              atlas of cross products by a group, the structure of connections between
              Coxeter graphs, and the structure of connections between affine Coxeter
              graphs.

This research is in the area of operator algebras, which can be
              thought of as the infinite dimensional analogue of the algebra of n-dimensional
              square matrices.  This subject had its origins in the early efforts to give a
              rigorous mathematical foundation to quantum mechanics, and there is still a
              rich symbiosis between the two subjects.
