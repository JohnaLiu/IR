The proposer will work on problems in  representation theory of
              quantum
affine algebras, infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and Macdonald
              polynomials.  He will continue to develop the vertex operator approach to
              symmetric functions.  In particular he will use this to study the realization
              of affine canonical basis in terms of Macdonald polynomials and will also
              investigate its application to  crystal  bases.  In addition he will use the
              recent method of quantum wedge modules to study perfect  crystal bases.

This
              project studies quantum affine algebras and vertex operator algebras, which are
               recent generalizations of Lie  algebras  and Lie groups.  The study of Lie
              algebras and quantum groups is aimed at revealing  more  symmetry  that existed
               in nature.  This symmetry is crucial to the theory of quantum mechanics  and
              quantum field theory, one of the most important  scientific  theories in this 
              century.
