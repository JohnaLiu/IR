Abstract    :
              The objective of this work is to enable high pay-off technologies for high-end
              parallel computing of database applications. The work involves exploring the
              next-generation distributed shared-memory (DSM) architectures on which to run
              high-performance memory-resident parallel databases. The architecture proposed
              has a radically new node and system organization based on processor-in-memory
              (PIM) chip technology. It includes intelligent memory for databases, support
              for reconfigurability and hardware support for speculative execution of
              queries.
 
This research also explores, for this architecture, novel
              algorithms to parallelize database queries, lay out and map database data and
              code, and schedule database threads. These algorithms, which also exploit some
              hardware support, are designed to be cache-conscious and, therefore, exploit
              deep memory hierarchies. A subset of the algorithms are to be implemented in a
              real parallelizing compiler (Polaris) and tested on a real parallel database
              that will be rewritten for scalability (Postgres95). The rewritten Postgres95
              code will be made available to other academic researchers for their use.
