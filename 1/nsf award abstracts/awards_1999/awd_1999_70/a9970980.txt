Multiple Interpretations
              of Domain-specific Languages

Recently, domain-specific languages (DSLs) have
              become a popular topic of research. Their promise is in their expressiveness.
              The programmer becomes concerned with specifying what computation is to be
              performed, and not with low level detail such as storage, or the order in which
              to perform computation. When a DSL is defined, the designer will have a primary
              interpretation in mind. For hardware description languages, for example, the
              primary interpretation may be a description of how individual gates and
              primitive circuits are to be wired together. However, DSLs also often have
              secondary interpretations. Again, a hardware description language may have
              simulators that provide it with a different semantics: an execution
semantics,
              which allow for testing circuits before they are committed to silicon. For
              these two distinct meanings to be useful, they must be coherent in some precise
              sense, perhaps expressed by a commuting diagram. This research investigates the
              principles and practice of multiple interpretations of DSLs. The expected
              outcomes include techniques for providing multiple coherent interpretations to
              DSLs; application of these techniques in the context of Hawk, a domain-specific
              language for specifying microprocessor microarchitectures; and a demonstration
              of the value of multiple interpretations by obtaining new results in
              microarchitecture verification.
