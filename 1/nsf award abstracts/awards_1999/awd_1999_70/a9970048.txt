              Award Abstract - 9970048

Visualizing complex fluorescently labeled objects,
              quantifying spatial relationships among objects, and analyzing the resulting
              spatially explicit image data have become important and essential tools for
              cell, molecular, and developmental biologists.  This award will support the
              purchase of a Leica Confocal Imaging Spectophotometer that will allow the
              Department of Biological Sciences at Dartmouth College to obtain more detailed
              three-dimensional information from fluorescent specimens.  Faculty and students
              at Dartmouth will use this instrument in a variety of research projects,
              including studies on the cytoskeleton, patterns of gene expression in
              developing flower primordia, gonadogenesis, and the identification of genes
              controlling cell fate and cell division.
