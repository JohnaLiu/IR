Abstract    :
              The surface chemistry of radical species is the focus of this research project
              carried out at Northwestern University in the group of Professor Peter Stair. 
              With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, this group is
              examining the interaction of hydrocarbon radicals produced in a clean gas phase
              source with well characterized metal and metal oxide surfaces.  Spectroscopic,
              kinetic, and isotope labeling studies are used to probe the mechanism of C-C
              coupling on these surfaces.  Methyl radical oxidation is also being explored. 
              Analogies between gas phase radical reactions, for example methyl interacting
              with hydroxyl radicals, are probed on the surface as well.  
 
Many
              heterogeneous catalytic reactions are likely to proceed via radical reaction
              intermediates.  Our understanding of these radical surface processes is quite
              limited however.  In this research project, a number of state of the art
              spectroscopic and synthetic methods are combined to probe the mechanisms of
              surface reactions involving radical participants.  The detailed information
              obtained from these studies is useful in designing catalytic materials and
              process chemistries for hydrocarbon refining.
