Hamkins
     Professor Hamkins will continue his research on the
              indestructibility 
phenomena of large cardinals.  This work, lying at the
              common focus of two
broad set-theoretic research efforts, namely, forcing and
              large cardinals,
seems particularly promising in light of the recent advances
              that have
emerged from his earlier work with gap forcing and the lottery
              preparation.
Specifically, Professor Hamkins will investigate a series of open
              questions
concerning the extent to which indestructibility is possible with
              various
kinds of large cardinals, with a particular focus on the strongly
              compact
cardinals.  In addition to this work, he will continue his work on two
              other
projects, the automorphism tower problem and the new theory of infinite
              time
Turing machines, a model of infinitary computation.
     Professor
              Hamkins' research involves the study of the sublime, 
inaccessible notions of
              mathematical infinity, which have fascinated 
mathematicians for centuries. 
              In the twentieth century, particularly in 
the past thirty years, set
              theorists have gained a profound understanding
of the largest of these
              transfinite numbers, large cardinals.  Professor
Hamkins has been particularly
              interested in how large cardinals are
affected by forcing, the technique
              invented by Paul Cohen by which set
theorists have had glimpses into
              alternative mathematical universes and
realized the rich diversity of
              mathematical possibility.  Much of his work
therefore lies in the common focus
              of two major set-theoretic research
efforts, namely, forcing and large
              cardinals.  He will endeavor to
investigate the curious indestructibility
              phenomena of these cardinals, by
which their largeness survives in a wide
              variety of mathematical universes.
