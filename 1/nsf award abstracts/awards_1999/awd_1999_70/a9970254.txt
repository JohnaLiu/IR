This project concerns combinatorial problems arising from
              algebraic geometry, commutative algebra and symbolic computation.  An essential
              part of this project is the training of graduate students and postdocs,
              specifically in the following three areas: cellular resolutions of monomial
              ideals and lattice ideals, Grobner deformations of regular holonomic D-modules,
              and multidimensional hypergeometric functions (as defined by 
              Gel'fand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky).  As part of this project, Sturmfels will write a
              book on ``Grobner deformations of hypergeometric differentialequations''
              jointly with Mutsumi Saito and Nobuki Takayama. Anotherkey ingredient in this
              project is the study, jointly with Eduardo Cattani and Alicia Dickenstein of
              rational hypergeometric functions and its relations to multidimensional
              residues.

Algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects defined by
              polynomial equations.  It has its roots in the 19th century investigations of
              David Hilbert, and has increasing modern applications to fields like physics
              and data security.
