Abstract
Savin

This award supports research in several areas of
              representation theory and modular forms with applications to number theory. In
              particular, we propose to determine  the Howe correspondence for generic
              square-integrable representations of classical p-adic groups.  This work is
              based 
on the recent classification of generic square-integrable
              representations of classical p-adic groups due to Goran Muic. 

The theory of
              modular forms was born more then a century ago, as powerful techniques of
              complex analysis were introduced to attack classical problems in number theory.
              It has remained a vibrant mathematical subject throughout the 20th century with
              applications in physics, and more recently in computer science, coding theory
              in particular.
