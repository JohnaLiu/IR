Mitchell
     The main topics of Mitchell's investigation
              concern the core model,
particularly its structure and existence in the
              vicinity of a Woodin
cardinal.  The structure of the core model is known far
              above a Woodin
cardinal, but its existence depends on the existence of a
              measurable
cardinal lying above the desired model.  Thus there is no core
              model
in the important case when a Woodin cardinal exists, but
              nothing
larger.  Preliminary results suggest, however, that some of the
              core
model structure remains.  Mitchell will attempt to understand
              this
structure better.  He will also study related topics involving
              closed,
unbounded sets and the existence and structure of the core model
              for
larger cardinals.  Larson will study Ramsey properties of
              countable
ordinals and of larger ordinals that are not small finite powers
              of
cardinals.
     Set theory is usually considered the foundation of all
              mathematics,
so studies of this kind are in a sense exploring the limits
              of
mathematical possibility.  The core model forms, as its name implies,
the
              rigid foundation of the universe of sets and is the major tool for
studying
              and validating axioms that extend the power of set theory and
hence of
              mathematics.  The ordinals form the skeleton of the universe
of sets, and
              understanding their combinatorial properties are vital to
understanding the
              universe of sets.
