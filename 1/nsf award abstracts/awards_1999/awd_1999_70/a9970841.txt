	This is a project
              in the study of automorphic forms, representation theory, and the statistics of
              unitary matrices.  Professor Bump will study the symmetric cube and the
              symmetric fourth power L-functions by means of a new technique of double
              Dirichlet series.  In this new approach L-functions are treated as residues of
              double Dirichlet series whose functional equations arise from functional
              equations of simpler L-functions. Other types of L-functions will be studied
              using the methods of Rankin-Selberg.  In related work Professor Bump will also
              study the statistics of random unitary matrices via Shur functions.  The
              investigator hopes that a novel new approach will further this classical
              study.

	This is a project in Number Theory.  At its heart, Number Theory is
              the study of the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4....  These most basic numbers have
              elaborate, interesting, and mysterious properties with applications in many
              branches of science and modern technology.  Many of the important properties of
              numbers can be mathematically summarized in objects called L-functions. These
              L-functions have their origins in the study of calculus and can be represented
              by several different formulas.  Professor Bump's project concentrates on the
              study of certain kinds of L-functions.  He expects his investigation of
              L-functions to increase our understanding of the properties of numbers that
              these functions encode.
