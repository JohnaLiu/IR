Abstract

	This project involves the aquisition, installation and
              use of a versatile and high throughput system that allows fractionation of
              soluble and membrane proteins from different plant and microbial systems and a
              sensitive protein detection instrument with high dynamic range of
              quantification capacity.  These two pieces of equipment will serve as the core
              of a protein facility being established by a group of six active scientists at
              the Ohio State Plant Biotechnology Center.  This facility will provide support
              to several major projects involved in signaling pathways in polarized cell
              growth, cell division and cell plate formation, pathogenesis, oxidative stress
              and oxygen sensing.  In addition, this equipment will aid in training of
              graduate students for exploring the function of various new proteins that are
              being discovered by this group.  The six participating groups absolutely
              require protein purification and detection capabilities to contiue to address
              the functions of novel proteins and protein-protein interactions.  The
              equipment being acquired in this project will provide a state-of-the-art
              facility for protein purification and analysis for this talented group of
              investigators.
