Large Scale Structure:  Decoupling dark ages, today

Marc
              Kamionkowski

Dr. Kamionkowski is conducting  a theoretical study to maximize
              the science return for new observations of the large scale structure of the
              universe.  The  research will focuses on two issues: (1) how can one probe the
              evolution of large scale structure during the time  between the decoupling time
              (near a redshift about 1100) and the structure delineated by current surveys;
              and (2) how can one reconstruct the distribution of mass in the Universe today
              from the observed distribution of luminous matter.  

Dr. Kamionkowski is
              exploring reionization from an early generation of gravitationally collapsed
              objects that might produce several signatures in the cosmic microwave
              background; for example, damping of the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum,
              secondary anisotropies at smaller angular scales, additional large angle
              polarization, and distortions to the cosmic microwave background energy
              spectrum.
