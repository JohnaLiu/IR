ABSTRACT

The proposed project will focus on the analysis 
of
              the properties of solutions for linear and  nonlinear 
Schroedinger equations.
              The principal investigator will 
continue his study of the regularity
              properties of fundamental solutions 
of time-depndent Schroedinger equations
              on noncompact and 
compact manifolds. Special attention will be paid to the
              
construction and analysis of global in time representations 
of fundamental
              solutions and their approximations. Also, 
the influence of trapped geodesics
              on the fractal properties 
of the fundamental solutions will be studied. The
              
principal investigator will study the basic questions of 
existence,
              multiplicity and regularity of Schroedinger 
maps. 


The Schroedinger
              equation is of fundamental importance 
for quantum physics and modern science
              and technology 
in general. Understanding the mathematical properties of
              
solutions to Schroedinger equations corresponding to different 
quantum
              systems helps one understand natural phenomena 
and  to advance technology.
              Fundamental science also encourages 
the quest for new, more sophisticated
              mathematical models. 
The equation for Schroedinger maps is a natural
              generalization 
of the familiar Schroedinger equation to a nonlinear
              enviroment. 
The study of Schroedinger maps is just beginning. 
We hope that
              it will inspire many new exciting results 
in theory and applications.
