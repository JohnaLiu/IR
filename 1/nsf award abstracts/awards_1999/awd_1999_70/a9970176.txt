A Molecular Imager will be used for
              quantification of radioistopes, fluorescence and chemiluminescence signals in
              studies of signal transduction.  The seven major users are junior and senior
              faculty, funded by national agencies.  Studies encompass the types of signals
              involved, initial perception, the signal cascade, and mechanisms by which
              downstream transcription is regulated in bacteria, plants and animals. These
              studies require quantitative high-resolution imaging for the analysis of
              enzymatic activities, binding studies, the identification and quantification of
              signaling complex proteins, and quantification of RNA and protein expression
              levels. Undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will
              be trained on the Imager. The Imager will be used in two upper level
              undergraduate laboratory courses.   Understanding the complex biological
              pathway of signal transduction will increase knowledge of  bacterial, plant and
              animal developmental and regulatory pathways.
