Abstract

		This project involves the acquisition, installation and
              use of instrumentation that will allow investigators at the City of Hope to
              localize molecules quantitatively in thin cryosections of tissue imaged by
              electron microscopy.  Knowledge of the molecular basis of life has grown
              considerably more detailed since the inception of electron microcopy for the
              examination of ultrathin sections of resin embedded tissues.   The need to be
              able to examine particular molecules at subcellular sites has driven the
              development of a means to make ultrathin sections of frozen cells and tissues. 
              Such cryosections can be labeled robustly with antibodies and other molecules
              such as fusion proteins and derivitized RNAs, and immunogold to localize these
              molecules to regions of specialized cellular activity.  City of Hope
              investigators have vigorous programs that can take advantage of this type of
              information in their studies of cell function.  Projects include studies of
              synaptic transmission; CD44a and its role in a morphogenetic model; the fate of
              products of transgenes such as Bcl-XL and mdr1; the fate of the major
              histocompatibility complex encoded B-G molecules in virally-infected cells; and
              localization of p53.  The equipment being acquired will make possible the
              quantitative analysis of cellular localization and co-localization in these and
              other projects at the City of Hope using a combination of ultrathin
              cryosections and immunogold labeling.
