Abstract    :
                     This project is to develop an algorithmic tool for solving multicriteria
              resource-constrained scheduling problems.  The goals are:  (1) to generalize
              and implement algorithms based on techniques that yield the best (analytical)
              worst-case performance guarantees for simpler but relevant models;  (2) develop
              tools for the worst-case analysis of algorithms in complex and realistic
              resource-constrained project scheduling settings;  (3) evaluate  the
              performance on real applications provided by research partners, including a
              large and complex maintenance scheduling problem  provided by Sandia National
              Laboratories; and (4)  develop techniques for solving the underlying linear
              programs faster by taking advantage of their special structure.
     If
              successful, this research will yield techniques to generate, in a variety of
              application domains (including chemical engineering, complex systems
              maintenance, project planning) collections of candidate high-quality schedules.
               Beyond yielding schedules of high quality for a particular optimality
              criterion, the collection of schedules will allow the selection of a schedule
              that balances best amongst a collection of optimality criteria.  In addition,
              the collection of schedules will allow flexibility in the choice of a schedule
              that best integrates with other elements of the logistics planning and
              optimization system. The work will also contribute to the computational tools
              and methodologies available for the solution of linear programs that arise in
              scheduling and resource allocation problems.
