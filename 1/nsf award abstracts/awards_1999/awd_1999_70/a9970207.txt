Abstract

Ten research laboratories at The Johns Hopkins
              University request funding to establish a multi-user x-ray crystallography
              facility.  The facility will be established on the Homewood campus of the Johns
              Hopkins University, where there are currently no such facilities.  The
              equipment will enable the researchers to  collect x-ray diffraction data from
              macromolecular crystals.  From this data, three-dimensional structures of
              proteins, nucleic acids, and complexes of proteins or of protein and nucleic
              acid can be determined.  Analysis of the structures will provide insight into
              the functions of the molecules, and this structural information will complement
              data collected using a variety of other techniques.  Among the topics
              being
studied by the research groups include:   How the binding of certain
              proteins leads to development of neural cells and the nervous system.   How to
              identify compounds that can prevent gelation of sickle cell
hemoglobulin,
              which may lead to a treatment for sickle cell anemia.  How proteins involved in
              bacterial conjugation, a DNA transfer mechanism, combine their activities to
              transfer genes between bacteria .  How proteins can recognize and bind DNA and
              thereby activate or repress gene expression.  How proteins can recognize and
              bind RNA.  How proteins work together to allow bacteria to take up sugars from
              their environment.  How proteins can remain stable despite large modifications
              such as  large insertions or charges within the protein core.
