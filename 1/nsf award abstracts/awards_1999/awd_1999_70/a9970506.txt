	This project
              involves the construction of modular generating series associated to algebraic
              cycles on certain Shimura varieties. The fact that such generating series
              should be the q-expansions of modular forms reflects some sort of hidden
              symmetry in the distribution of algebraic subvarieties of these varieties. In
              addition, in certain cases, there is a more delicate type of generating series
              whose coefficients lie in the 
arithmetic Chow groups of an integral model of
              a Shimura variety. Such series appear to be related to the derivatives of
              Siegel-Eisenstein series and hence, in turn, to the central derivatives of
              automorphic L-functions. Thus, it is hoped that one may ultimately obtain
              information about higher dimensional analogues of the Gross-Zagier formula and
              the Birch-Swinnerton Dyer conjecture. 

The powerful techniques which are now
              emerging in modern number theoretic geometry have made it possible to manage
              previously intractable problems centered about solving equations with integers.
              Strong connections have been found between the geometric properties of graphs
              associated with an equation and the integer solutions to that equation.  For
              example, the celebrated Mordell conjecture, proved by Faltings in 1983, 
              asserts an equation whose graph is a surface with at least two holes can have
              only a finite number of integer solutions. The present project involves more
              complicated versions of this connection in which the equations and their graphs
              require extra dimensions and the `integer solutions' may actually be other
              kinds of geometric objects (curves, surfaces, etc.)
