Abstract    :
              9970514

The investigator conducts and supervises research in graph theory
              with emphasis on structural characterizations of various properties of graphs,
              and develops efficient practical algorithms based on this research.  The major
              areas of interest are (i) Tutte's conjecture, Hadwiger's conjecture, and
              spatial embeddings of graphs and applications, (ii) Pfaffian orientations of
              graphs, (iii) Negami's planar cover conjecture, (iv) excluded minor theorems
              and tools to prove them (splitter theorems), (v) a theory of reducibility for
              the double cycle cover conjecture, and possible applications to the Four Color
              Theorem.

Graph theory is a relatively young field that has applications in
              telecommunications, transportation, production, warehousing, storage allocation
              and many other applied areas.  It deals with problems that are discrete in
              nature, such as how to optimally build a telephone network at the lowest
              possible cost.  The project studies structural aspects of graph theory from a
              theoretical point of view, with the aim of converting theoretical results into
              fast and efficient algorithms.  An example of the investigator's prior result
              is his solution (with Robertson and Seymour) of the `even directed cycle
              problem', a computer science question that has been open for the last quarter
              of a century, and has applications in mathematical physics, computer science
              and economics.
