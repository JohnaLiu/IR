Abstract    :
              This project involves the use of differences to obtain new estimates for the 
              number of lattice points close to a smooth curve, and for the number of 
              lattice points close to a smooth surface. The principal investigator has 
              several specific problems on which he will apply the methods. These problems
              include questions about the distribution of squarefull numbers, cubefull 
              numbers, almost prime numbers, and B-free numbers. Another research topic of
              the project is to extend the current difference approaches to algebraic number
              fields.

This research is in the general field of number theory although
              techniques  from approximation theory and combinatorics are essential
              ingredients.  Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions about
              the  divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest 
              branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely 
              aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it has become an 
              indispensable tool with diverse applications in areas such as data transmission
              and processing, and communication systems.
