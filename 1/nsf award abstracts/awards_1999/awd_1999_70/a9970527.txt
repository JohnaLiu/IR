Abstract    :
              The investigator studies three types of problems in  structural graph theory.
              (1) To determine if a given graph contains  spanning subgraphs with small
              maximum degree,  in particular,  Hamilton cycles and spanning trees. (2) To
              determine if a given graph contains a specific graph as a topological minor. 
              (3) To determine the number of cycles in a cycle decomposition or  cycle
              covering of a graph. The invesitgator also works on the knapsack problem in
              combinatorial optimization. 

A graph can be viewed as a network which
              consists of nodes and links.  Graph theory studies properties of networks (such
              as reliability) which are of both theoretical and practical interest. The
              investigator works on problems concerning the existence of small networks
              inside big networks. The research has potential applications in  designing
              networks where special reliability condition is required at certain nodes.
