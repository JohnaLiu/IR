     This research is concerned with the theory of tensor
              categories, in
particular, with the categories of representations of quantum
              groups
and affine Lie algebras arising in mathematical physics. 
              The
principal investigator will work on the geometric realization of
              these
categories in terms of sheaves on configuration spaces.  In
particular,
              he will work on a geometric construction of the unitary
inner product in such
              categories, which is extremely important for
physical applications.  He will
              study the combinatorial identities
that arise, generalizing Macdonald's inner
              product identities to
affine root systems.  The principal investigator will
              also work on a 
book containing an accurate and complete exposition of the
              theory of
tensor categories, modular functors, and topological quantum
              field
theory, using as the main example the category of representations
              of
quantum groups at roots of unity, whose physical counterpart is
              the
Wess-Zumino-Witten modular functor.
     This study is in the general
              area of representation theory of Lie
algebras and related objects, or, more
              generally, mathematical
structures appearing in physics (conformal field
              theory).  This is a
very actively developing field, in which mathematics is
              greatly
enriched with the new ideas and intuition coming from
              physics.
Unfortunately, sometimes there is a large gap between the
              physical
ideas and mathematically rigorous construction or proof, which
              can
take years to fill.  This project should fill some of these gaps and
pave
              the way to new mathematical discoveries.
