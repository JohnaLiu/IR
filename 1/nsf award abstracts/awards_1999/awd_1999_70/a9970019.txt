Abstract    :
              The 1999 IEEE International Conference on System, Man and Cybernetics (SMC'99)
              will be held at Tokyo International Forum, Tokyo, Japan on October 12-15, l999.
               The SMC'99 conference will be co-sponsored by IEEE System, Man and Cybernetics
              Society (SMC), Society of Instrument and Control Engineers (SICE), Robotics
              Society of Japan (RSJ),  and Japanese Society of Mechanical Engineers (JSME). 
              The conference them' Human Communication and Cybernetics' emphasizes the new
              paradigms and perspectives in systems science and engineering that support
              human activities in planning, design, decision making, and associated resource
              allocation under enormous amounts of information networks in the coming
              century.                                                                       
                                                                                             
                                                                    This project request
              funds to provide trave awards to students representing US institutions selected
              as a finalist in the SMC'99 Best Student Paper Competition.  Support will
              ensure the finalist representing US institutions  will not be hinder from
              participating due to the high cost of travel.
