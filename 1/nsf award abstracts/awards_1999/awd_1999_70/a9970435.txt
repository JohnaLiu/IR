Abstract    :
              This project concerns several topics in algebraic geometry:  (1) (with A. Buch)
              to find formulas for degeneracy loci arising from several vector bundle maps in
              terms of Chern classes of the bundles; this involves a combinatorial problem
              generalizing the notion of Littlewood-Richardson numbers; (2) to understand
              relations between such formulas and quantum cohomology; (3) (with J. Harris) to
              understand why Schubert calculus (orintersection theory) on a given
              Grassmannian is controlled by Schubert calculus on smaller Grassmannians, as it
              must be by recent work of Klyachko, Knutson, and Tao; (4) (with R. MacPherson)
              to investigate compactifications of spaces of curves along the lines that we
              have done for sets of points; (5) to study toric varieties, especially as
              related to quantum cohomology; (6) (with K. Behrend, D. Edidin, B. Fantechi, L.
              Goettsche, and A. Kresch) to write an accessible introduction to the theory of
              stacks.

My main interest is in algebraic geometry, and neighboring areas in
              representation theory, topology, and combinatorics.  Many of the fundamental
              spaces that arise in mathematics are very special algebraic varieties, most of
              whose properties can be described by some finite (combinatorial) data. 
              Important examples of these are Schubert varieties, related to loci where
              matrices have various ranks, and toric varieties, whose combinatorics involves
              convex polytopes and lattice points.  The mutual interplay between the geometry
              and the combinatorics is beneficial to both.  I am also interested in
              constructions of moduli spaces, which are spaces of geometric objects. Deciding
              how to include limiting objects, which amounts to compactifying these moduli
              spaces, is a central theme in algebraic geometry.
