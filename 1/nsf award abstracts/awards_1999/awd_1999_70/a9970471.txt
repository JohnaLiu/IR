This proposal is a collaborative proposal
              between researchers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Vanderbilt
              University.  The PI's will consider several algorithmic problems associated
              with presentations of groups and semigroups.  In particular they will use
              recent results on Higman type embeddings of free Burnside groups into finitely
              presented groups in order to construct an infinite torsion group with a finite
              number of generators and a finite number of relations.  They will also use
              these embedding results to study computational complexity by algebraic means. 
              In a second set of problems, they will study connections between residually
              finite extensions of free groups and their connection with dynamics of
              polynomial maps over p-adic numbers.  A third set of problems is concerned with
              use of automata-theoretic methods to study algorithmic problems about subgroups
              of various classes and associated problems.  A fourth set of problems is
              concerned with the study of diagram groups---groups that arise naturally in
              connection with semigroup presentations.

Groups and semigroups are algebraic
              objects that arise ubiquitously in mathematics whenever one studies symmetries
              of a mathematical object.  When these groups and semigroups are well described,
              certain algorithmic techniques my be used to study them.  There are
              applications of these studies to a number of areas including computer
              science.
