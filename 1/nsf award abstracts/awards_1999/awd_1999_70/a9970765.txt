Abstract    :
              This doctoral dissertation project will examine communication about the past
              within families of Jewish Veterans who fought in the Soviet Army during World
              War II and who now live in the United States. Ethnographic methods will be
              employed to trace how the decisive moments one generation's past are understood
              or repudiated by successive generations. The project will contribute to the
              discipline by applying theory from literature on immigration and ethnicity,
              identity theory, and theory regarding the sustenance and loss of collective
              memory to interpretation of a community's relationship to a complex past.
              Studies of collective memory constitute a burgeoning field of sociological
              inquiry, and this dissertation will extend this research into the sphere of
              relationships between grandparents and grandchildren. In addition, the
              dissertation will contribute to research on intergenerational transmission,
              which has rarely incorporated more than two generations, and to research on
              intergenerational relationships, which has focused primarily on concurrent
              phenomena. The intensity and symbolic depth of both Soviet history and Jewish
              history will serve to dramatize the dynamics to be researched.
