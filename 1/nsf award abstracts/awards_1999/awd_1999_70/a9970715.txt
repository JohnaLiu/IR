Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include work on string
              theory, the application of ideas from string theory to the investigation of
              quantum chromodynamics, and other studies of quantum chromodynamics. String
              theory is the leading candidate for a unified theory of all forces.  Quantum
              chromodynamics is the theory of the strong nuclear force.  These investigations
              are thus very important for our understanding of the elementary particles and
              the forces through which they interact.
