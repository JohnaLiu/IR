The research project proposed here is based on the objective
              of enhancing database management systems by exploiting the large information
              bandwidth associated with photonic information processing systems. In
              particular, this proposal focuses on the development of smart pixel based
              systems suitable for interfacing large capacity page-oriented optical storage
              devices with conventional electronic computers. The single chip smart pixel
              arrays proposed here are based on a photonic VLSI technology that is based on
              conventional CMOS device technologies.

The project is divided into four
              phases. The first phase concentrates on development and testing of the smart
              pixel circuits required to implement the filter. Phase 2 uses these smart pixel
              components to implement a 16 x 16-bit database filter that provides input
              bandwidth comparable to a strictly electronic implementation. Knowledge gained
              building the 16 x 16-bit system is applied in phase 3 to the implementation of
              a 128 x 128-bit filter. With more than 16,000 input channels, this system is
              expected to provide significantly more input bandwidth than electronic
              components can achieve. Further, this implementation represents a factor of 4
              more input data channels than current state-of-the-art photonic VLSI
              components. To complete the research, both systems will be utilized as
              application test beds suitable for evaluating the practical and technological
              barriers that face efforts to incorporate the proposed database filter into the
              read head of future page-oriented optical storage devices.
