Abstract    :
              The proposers will work on inverse coefficient problems where the 
given data
              is the scattering amplitude at fixed energy. The desired 
result is that this
              determines the unknown coefficients. Specifically,
they will consider this
              problem for the acoustic wave equation in
an exterior domain with the sound
              speed and the boundary of the 
domain as unknowns to be determined by the
              scattering data. They are
also interested in the related problem of recovering
              metrics modulo
diffeomorphisms from scattering data for Laplace-Beltrami
              operator.
The proposed method of attack is via integral equations that they
              
derived from Faddeev-type Green's functions in earlier work. The 
preceding
              problems will be posed in three or more dimensions. In two
dimensions this
              approach needs to be combined with other methods like
the d-bar equation. The
              proposers will investigate ways of doing this
for the wave equation in an
              anisotropic medium.

   Inverse scattering problems arise when one wishes to
              recover physical
properties of an object from data obtained by remote
              observations.
Interpreted broadly, they include methods oil exploration and
              medical
imaging. The problems that will be studied in this project include
              
showing that it is theoretically possible to determine both the
              acoustic
properties of a medium surrounding a solid obstacle and the shape of
              
the obstacle itself from reflected sound waves.
