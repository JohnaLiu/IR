              AWARD ABSTRACT - 9970189

To enhance the existing research facilities in the
              Department of Biology at Slippery Rock University, this award from the National
              Science Foundation will be used for the acquisition of an integrated
              instrumentation package consisting of an automated, research-grade
              photomicroscopy system, a cryostage and controller, and an anti-vibration
              table.  The requested microscope will be equipped with optics permitting
              bright-field, phase-contrast, epifluorescence, and Nomarski DIC microscopic
              observations.  As comparable facilities do not exist at Slippery Rock
              University or in the vicinity of the University, the requested instrumentation
              will significantly enhance the research opportunities for the investigators
              whose respective areas of research encompass the ecology and biodegradative
              capabilities of microorganisms living in soil environments impacted by acid
              mine drainage, investigations into the effects of acid mine drainage on the
              ecology of freshwater stream microorganisms and macroinvertebrates, and the
              ecophysiology of cold-tolerance in insects at the cellular level. 
              Additionally, undergraduate student researchers will be provided with an
              opportunity to use the instrumentation in their collaborative projects with
              faculty, and will benefit from the new avenues of investigation this
              instrumentation makes possible.
