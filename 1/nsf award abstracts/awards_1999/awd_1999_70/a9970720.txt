Abstract    :
              Increasingly, cluster and LAN interconnection networks are being called upon to
              support distributed access to multimedia data sets with quality of service
              (QoS) guarantees. The objective of this research is to develop effective
              architectural solutions that enable QoS guarantees for multimedia traffic in
              cluster/LAN interconnection networks. The core challenge of the research work
              is to develop effective high speed QoS schedulers capable of making decisions
              across a large number of multimedia connections in tens of nanoseconds: QoS
              scheduling decisions at cut-through latencies. These objectives will be pursued
              by the design and detailed simulation of the architecture of a single-chip
              router optimized for multimedia applications. The innovative aspects of the
              router architecture concern a novel priority biasing scheme and the use of flow
              control
for dynamic bandwidth allocation. Around these techniques are
              constructed new buffering, bandwidth allocation, and flow control schemes.
              Important research contributions of the program will include (i) router
              architectures that support QoS scheduling at cut-though latencies, (ii)
              understanding of effective architectural techniques for constructing high speed
              schedulers, and (ii) solutions to difficult problems of high speed hardware
              resource management and scheduling.
