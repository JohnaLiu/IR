Abstract    :
              Professors Johnson and Adams shall investigate cooling mirror suspension to
              cryogenic temperatures.  The primary activity will be measuring the dissipation
              parameter (called Q-1) for possible mirror suspension wires as a function of
              temperature T.  The parameters Q and T determine the size and character of
              thermal noise.  They shall investigate one or two special metallic alloys that
              they have identified as good candidates.
If gravitational wave observatories
              such as LIGO are successful, we shall have a new way to observe some of the
              most awesome events in the life of the universe, such as the inspiral of two
              neutron stars to their cataclysmic coalescence and the subsequent birth of a
              black hole.  The LIGO project will attempt detection of gravitational waves
              from such events with two observatories which have 4 kilometer long laser
              interferometers.  The big scientific payoff may not come with the initial
              instrument, but only after substantial improvements in sensitivity.  This award
              is directed towards developing the technology to make a major improvement in
              one of the most important limits to LIGO sensitivity: the problem of thermal
              noise in the suspension of the interferometer mirrors.
