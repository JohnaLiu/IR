Abstract    :
              Roald Hoffmann of Cornell University is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to pursue theoretical studies of chemical
              bonding and reactivity in extended systems.  The main intent of this research
              is to develop qualitative explanations of electronic structure, bonding, and
              reactivity in a variety of chemical systems using extended Huckel theory and
              density functional theory.  Applications include electron-rich intermetallics,
              metal-chalcogen bonding, polymer adhesion to aluminum oxide surfaces, and
              hypothetical ceramic structures.

Computational chemistry is at the stage
              where it is possible to attain predictive chemical accuracy for medium-sized
              molecules.  Nevertheless, there remains a need for deeper understanding of the
              chemical principles responsible for the structure, energetics, and reactivity
              of molecules.  The classification of new species and materials with unusual
              physical and chemical properties relies on these principles, namely
              electrostatics, electronegativity, and orbitals.
