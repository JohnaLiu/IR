Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical physics will focus on the use of supersymmetry
              to
determine detailed properties of magnetic monopoles, elementary
              particles,
and strings. Supersymmetry is a hypothesized symmetry of nature
              that can
potentially solve several mysteries in elementary particle physics
              and
astrophysics. The use of supersymmetry in the present work will lead
              to
exact rather than approximate results, and so will yield new insights
              into
how the elementary particles interact with each other.
