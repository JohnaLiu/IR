Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical physics will include (1) an investigation of algebraic
              and geometric aspects of mathematical structures in superstring theory and (2)
              studies of the strong interactions through the use of high performance computer
              simulations.  Superstring theory is a very promising approach to unifying all
              the known fundamental interactions in Nature.  It may also provide an
              understanding of the origins of the Universe.  Computer simulations of the
              strong interactions are essential for extracting several of the fundamental
              constants of Nature from high precision experimental measurements.  Knowledge
              of these constants places strong constraints on unification schemes.  Computer
              simulations will also be used to learn about interactions of quarks and gluons,
              the fundamental constituents of matter, at temperatures that may have occurred
              in the early moments of the formation of the Universe.
