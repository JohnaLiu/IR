Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include studies of the
              structure and interactions of elementary particles using geometrical
              configurations in superstring theory. Superstring theory is a leading candidate
              for a theory of all the fundamental forces in nature. There will also be study
              of the relations between superstring theory and the quantum field theories
              which have been used in the past to describe the elementary particles. The
              project to be undertaken is part of a major thrust in our effort to understand
              the fundamental forces in nature.
