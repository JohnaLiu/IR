ABSTRACT

The PI proposes to study qualitative
              properties of nonlinear

elliptic and parabolic partial differential
              equations (PDEs), such

as the existence, uniqueness, stability, symmetry, a
              priori estimates,

and asymptotic behavior of solutions. This type of
              research is

fundamental to the understanding of many physical problems
              governed by

PDEs. The PI's will continue the development of a class of
              very

powerful techniques, namely the Method of Moving Planes, to the
              study

of local asymptotic symmetry of singular solutions and a
              priori

estimates of solutions. The PI will also continue the joint work
              with

W. Chen on the geometric problem of finding a conformal metric with
              a

prescribed Gaussian or scalar curvature. The PI is also involved

in the
              study of certain parabolic systems arising form other branches

of
              sciences.



Many aspects of natural phenomena are related to each other by
              the

natural laws governing them and very often these relations
              are

mathematically described by differential equations. The study of
              these

equations is very important in understanding the related
              phenomena.

It is often the case that to solve differential equations
              

computationally with sufficient accuracy, the most effective
              and

economical way is to exploit the properties of solutions of the
              

equations and then to develop algorithms in accordance}. Besides
              being

very useful in applied science, the study of various kinds
              of

structures and properties of solutions to various types of
              equations

invariably leads to new research endeavors.
