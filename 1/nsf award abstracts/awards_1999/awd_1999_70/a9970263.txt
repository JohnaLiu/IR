Abstract    :
              The main goal of this project is to study the following problems in
commutative
              algebra: 1) The Canonical Element Conjecture  of Hochster,
2) Serr's
              Conjecture on Intersection Multiplicity and the Chow group problem,
3) the
              study of asymptotic behavior of homologies in positive characteristic and
4)
              the Strong Intersection Conjecture due to Peskine and Szpiro. Each of these
              is
a longstanding open problem and occupies a central position in the areas
              of
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

Commutative algebra and
              algebraic geometry may be thought of 
as studying solutions of many equations
              in many unknowns 
when, typically, the solution is not unique. The set of
              
solutions can then be viewed geometrically, but one 
can use instead encode
              all the pertinent information about 
the equations in abstract algebraic
              objects called commutative 
rings. The two points of view interact in
              beautiful and 
productive ways. A breakthrough method in commutative algebra
              that 
has had explosive development in this decade is the theory of tight
              
closure. Part of the underlying idea is to consider the system 
of
              equations, after sutiable modification, or the ring, modulo 
many different
              prime integers. This is a powerful technique 
that has solved many problems,
              while opening up vast new 
areas for research.
