This project will study L-functions, which arise in number theory,
              representation theory, and harmonic analysis.  Specifically, the project will
              study automorphic L-functions through the systematic examination of certain
              Dirichlet series in two complex variables built up out of sums of L-functions. 
              These naturally occurring Dirichlet series are not themselves Euler products,
              but their individual coefficients are Eulerian.  The intent is to use the extra
              variable in these series to extract analytic information similar to that which
              one could be obtained by the approximate functional equation were it possible
              to carry it out to infinite length.  These two variable Dirichlet series
              originally appeared in investigations of Rankin-Selberg integrals.  This
              project will also continue the study these integrals.

In the last part of
              the twentieth century, the arithmetic properties of the integers have found new
              application in communications, security and other surprising areas of modern
              life.  Mathematicians have long studied the integers in a branch of mathematics
              called number theory.  Some of the simplest properties of the integers still
              contain deep mysteries, and recently mathematicians have developed powerful new
              techniques to explore these mysteries.  The broad aim of this project is to
              study functions which exhibit certain complicated symmetries.  These functions
              are of interest because they often encode arithmetic information about other
              things, for instance the number of solutions  to sets of equations.  The study
              of these functions provides insight into the symmetries and into the encoded
              arithmetic.
