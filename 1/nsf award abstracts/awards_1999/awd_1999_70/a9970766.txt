Abstract    :
              Chi Mak at the University of Southern California is supported by a grant from
              the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research
              involving path integral simulations of condensed-phase quantum dynamics.  The
              research has two major goals: 1) to understand the influence of the environment
              on the dynamics of tunneling systems such as those in electron transfer
              reactions; and 2) to develop new simulation techniques to accomplish this goal.
               Two models have thus far been developed by Mak: 1) a multilevel blocking (MLB)
              algorithm which works with models having several explicit degrees of freedom,
              and 2) a chromostochastic quantum dynamics (CSQD) method that works with models
              in which the environment is represented by an infinite collection of simple
              degrees of freedom.  Mak will further develop these ideas and apply them to new
              systems, and also develop a new hybrid method to treat models outside the reach
              of either of the other two methods.

Electron transfer reactions are an
              important class of chemical reactions with particular relevance in chemistry
              and biology.  In these reactions the electron's ability to tunnel from the
              donor to the acceptor is heavily influenced by its surroundings.   Despite the
              success of Marcus theory, many questions, especially those related to the
              quantal features of electron tunneling dynamics, still remain.  Mak's research
              will help to elucidate these important contributions, and further our
              understanding of this important class of chemical reactions.
