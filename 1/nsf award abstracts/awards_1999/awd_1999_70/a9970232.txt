High Field NMR
              Instrumentation for Structural Studies of Proteins and Nucleic Acids

This
              grant supports the acquisition of a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer in the Department
              of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Texas A&M. The spectrometer will
              significantly enhance the study of protein and nucleic acid structure and
              dynamics at Texas A&M.  Projects that will benefit from the new spectrometer
              include:  (1) investigation of the structure and dynamics of proteins that
              regulate gene expression, (2) investigation of the structure and dynamics of
              chemokines that are related to HIV, (3) studies concerning the structure,
              thermodynamics, and metal ion binding of catalytic RNA molecules, (4) studies
              focused on hydrogen bonds in proteins and nucleic acids, (5) de novo design and
              characterization of proteins, and (6) the analysis of conformations of peptides
              containing elements that mimic the turns found in proteins.  None of these
              studies can be accomplished using the spectrometers currently available to
              researchers at Texas A&M.

In addition to having a significant impact on
              research at Texas A&M, the 600 MHz spectrometer is also expected to have an
              impact on training students.  The new spectrometer will become part of the
              Biomolecular NMR facility.  This facility provides  postgraduate, graduate, and
              undergraduate students with access to high field NMR equipment.  Students from
              three different departments use this facility.  The addition of a 600 MHz
              spectrometer will significantly expand the training of students in the area of
              macromolecular structure and dynamics.
