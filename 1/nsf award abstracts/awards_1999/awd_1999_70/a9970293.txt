Abstract    :
              Several related investigations into processes of high energy atomic physics,
              studying the interaction of photons and electrons with correlated atomic
              systems are proposed. These include the role of higher multipole effects, the
              structure of scattering amplitudes, Compton and Delbruck scattering and
              photoionization at energies where relativistic and correlation effects become
              of comparable magnitude.
