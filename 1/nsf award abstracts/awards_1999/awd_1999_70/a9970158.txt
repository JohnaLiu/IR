Abstract    :
              The Santa Fe Institute (SFI) will conduct multidisciplinary research in the
              science of complexity.  SFI will run a visiting scientist program, a workshop
              program, and maintain its summer school on complexity and its education and
              outreach activities.  The organizing themes central to all the SFI workshops
              and the visitor program include evolutionary dynamics, integrating form and
              organization with dynamics, robustness of natural and social systems, and
              complex networks dynamics.  Researchers involved in the SFI activities will
              come from many disciplines, including biology, physics, mathematics,
              computation, and the social behavioral, and economic sciences.  The techniques
              of complexity, chaos, and adaptive systems provide the unifying intellectual
              basis for the proposed studies.  Graduate student and postdocs are integral to
              all of the SFI activities.  SFI also will serve as the host for an REU Site
              program and a program that will provide broadening, multidisciplinary research
              experiences to physics graduate students.
