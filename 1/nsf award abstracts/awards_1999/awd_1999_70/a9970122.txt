This award will support participants at the ICCP99:
              International Conference 
on Complementarity Problems: Contemporary
              Applications and Algorithms 
to be held at the Wisconsin Center of the
              University of Wisconsin-Madison 
from June 9-12, 1999.  The general goal of
              the conference is to bring 
together researchers from a variety of backgrounds
              who are involved in 
theoretical, applied, and/or computational research on
              complementarity 
problems.  They will present and discuss the latest results
              in this area, and 
offer suggestions for collaborative research and further
              development of the 
field.  The conference will focus on three major themes:
              (1) finance and 
economic applications, (2) engineering and machine learning,
              and (3) 
computational methods.
