Abstract    :
              This project will be a continuation of the investigator's research in the
              modular representation theories of algebraic groups and of finite symmetric
              groups, and to explore consequences and related results in combinatorics and
              number theory.  Projects to be undertaken include a determination of the
              integers n and primes p such that n has a self-conjugate p-core partition (this
              has implications in number theory and representation theory); a construction of
              the ordinary irreducible projective representations of the finite symmetric
              groups; and a more general investigation of the tensor product in the category
              of representations of the symmetric group.

Group theory is often described
              as ``the study of symmetry;'' indeed, the particular groups under consideration
              here are called symmetric groups.  Group theory arises and is used in a wide
              variety of other fields, including chemistry (crystallography), coding theory
              and cryptography, and solid state physics.  Understanding the structure of
              groups is the major task of group theory.  As every finite group is contained
              in a symmetric group, the symmetric groups play an important
role.
