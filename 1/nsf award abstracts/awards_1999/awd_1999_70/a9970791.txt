Abstract    :
              A theory of cold-atom collisions and highly excited molecular spectra is
              proposed which stresses the common features of all atomic systems.  By
              combining analytic solutions of a certain class of long-range potentials with
              the numerical solution of the coupled states problem at short range, it is
              possible to extract parameters which describe a range of atomic systems.  In
              addition, the approach leads to a more efficient computational procedure which
              avoids the integration of these equations to very large distances.
