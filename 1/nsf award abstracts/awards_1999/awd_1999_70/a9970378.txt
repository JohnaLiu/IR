Abstract    :
              This project has two parts: The first part  concerns the construction of
              integral models of Shimura varieties over primes of non-smooth reduction. The
              second part focuses on the study of the integral representations that appear in
              the cohomology of arithmetic varieties with an action by a finite group; there
              are connections with special values of L-functions, with the theory of class
              groups of cyclotomic fields and applications to determining the geometric
              Galois module structure of lattices of modular forms.  

This research falls
              into a modern area of  number theory known as arithmetic geometry in which
              geometric methods are used to solve problems in number theory.  Number theory
              has its historical roots in the study of the natural numbers. It is among the
              oldest branches of mathematics. Within the last half century it has become an
              indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission
              and processing, and communication systems.
