Abstract    :
              The proposal research is to study the synthesis and characterization of
              low-phonon energy materials doped with rare earth for remote sensing, infrared
              spectroscopy, infrared counter-measures, and efficient fiber amplifiers for
              telecommunications.  Studies include concentration dependence of energy
              transfer in Tm: YC13, a  study of upper state lifetime in Ho: YC13  optimal
              growth conditions for Er: PKb2Cl3, and co-doped systems.
