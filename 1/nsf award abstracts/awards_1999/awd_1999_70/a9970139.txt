TITLE:           NSF-CNPq Collaborative Research:
              Automatic Configuration
and
                 Monitoring of Component-Based

Component technology has appeared as the most
              promising solution for the
problem of effective software development for the
              coming decades. It
supports
the construction of sophisticated systems by
              assembling together a
collection
of off-the-shelf software components with
              the help of visual tools or
programmatic interfaces. However, existing
              component architectures lack
support to analyze and exploit the nature and
              magnitude of interactions and
dependencies among components.

The objective
              of this research is to apply the knowledge about component
requirements and
              dependencies to permit the automatic configuration of
software systems with
              little or no intervention from system administrators
or
users. It focuses on
              developing formal models and software tools for
reifying
the interactions
              between components. With these tools, the project will
produce (1) an
              infrastructure for automatic configuration of distributed
component-based
              systems and (2) a generic framework for collecting,
consolidating, analyzing,
              and visualizing qualitative and quantitative
information about component
              interaction.

The research will offer an important software infrastructure
              which has been
neglected by existing object and component architectures.  It
              has a great
potential impact on the reliability, flexibility, and
              automatic
adaptability of next generation distributed systems.
