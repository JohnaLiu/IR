Summary

Four major and five minor users at the University of
              Minnesota are acquiring an EPR
instrumentation upgrade to study the dynamics,
              structure, and function of proteins involved in muscle contraction, membrane
              calcium transport, photosynthesis, lipid binding and transport, and protein
              folding. The investigators are studying biological function and mechanism
              through mutagenesis, protein design, physiology, and enzyme kinetics, as well
              as a variety of structural techniques, using the shared facilities of a
              recently established Structural Biophysics Core Laboratory (SBCL).  The new
              instrument has capabilities that will (1)  allow experiments on small and
              precious samples, such as mutant proteins, single muscle fibers, and single
              protein crystals, and the capability for programmable data-acquisition for
              time-resolved EPR experiments, (2) include specialized resonators for small
              oriented samples and for time-resolved photochemical EPR experiments, and (3)
              has a second higher spectrometer frequency, to increase sensitivity and
              resolution and decrease ambiguity of data analysis.   The structure and
              dynamics of muscle structural proteins will be detected by EPR simultaneously
              with muscle mechanics and correlated with the aging process. Transient and
              multi-frequency EPR will be used to probe the kinetics of turnover of the
              catalytic site of photosystem II, the photosynthetic water-oxidizing complex.
              The dynamic interaction between lipid binding proteins and bound lipids will be
              probed by EPR in solution and single protein crystals and coordinated with
              x-ray crystallography.
