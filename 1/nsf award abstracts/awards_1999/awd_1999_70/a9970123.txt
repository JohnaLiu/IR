Abstract    :
              Under this project, researchers at the University of Maine and the Brazilian
              National Institute for Space Research (INPE) are collaborating to study new
              models for integrating geographic information. The two research teams
              complement each other, providing a unique synergy in conceptual modeling and
              systems development. Long-term visits by Brazilian researchers assure a tight
              cooperation, and provide for integrated research and education. The work
              focuses on the semantics of spatial data collections that are stored in
              geographic information systems or spatial databases. Such collections often
              have diverse database schemas and lack conventions that would make them easily
              compatible, so that they could be combined to perform an integrated analysis.
              The goal of this research is to develop computational models that will allow us
              to compare, harmonize, and integrate geographic information across different
              ontologies and different spatial data models. The approach consists of a new
              integrated method to assess similarity based on common parts, functions, and
              attributes. In these similarity assessments, different contexts are considered
              through the operations a user intents to perform with the harmonized data. The
              results of this project will provide meaningful comparisons and integration of
              geospatial information, enabling better interoperation among geographic
              information systems.
