Abstract    :
              BORCHERDS, 9970611
 
The object of the proposal is to extend knowledge of
              automorphic forms
and vertex algebras and the relations between them. The main
              ideas for
doing this are to investigate automorphic forms on the fake
              monster
Lie group, and to investigate higher dimensional analogues of
              vertex
algebras.

Vertex algebras are a way of encoding some of
              the
calculations that physicists do with Feynman diagrams in string
theory.
              They are often very symmetric; for example, there is one whose
symmetries form
              the "monster simple group" and which can be used to
explain the so-called
              moonshine conjectures. An automorphic form is a
special sort of function which
              is unusually symmetric. A typical
example is the "elliptic modular function",
              which is closely connected
with the vertex algebra of the monster simple
              group
