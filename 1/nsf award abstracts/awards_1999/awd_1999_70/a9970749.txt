Abstract    :
              This proposal centers around nuclear structure theory and its applications in
              astrophysics, particle physics and condensed matter physics. 

One of the
              principal themes is the development of appropriate theoretical tools for the
              description of nuclei far from stability and their application to the variety
              of new phenomena expected. Studies related to deformed halos in neutron-rich
              nuclei, to proton-neutron pairing correlations in N = Z nuclei, and to new
              features of nucleon transfer reactions, the nuclear effective interaction and
              beta decay rates are proposed. Other nuclear structure projects are concerned
              with the proton-neutron monopole force and the possible role of single-particle
              resonances in extending the high spin structure of nuclei beyond the band
              termination point.

A secondary theme of the proposal concerns the
              application of mapping techniques to problems outside the nuclear structure
              domain. Baryon mappings, which have recently been shown to be promising as a
              means of building nuclei directly from constituent quarks, will be applied to
              one- and two-nucleon systems and to symmetric nuclear matter. Boson mappings
              will be used to treat the dynamics of antiferromagnetic spin chains, in an
              extension of earlier work.
