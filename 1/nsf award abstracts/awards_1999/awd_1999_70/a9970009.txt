Henson
     This project emphasizes mathematical logic in relation to
              other
areas of mathematics and computer science.  C. Ward Henson will
              use
methods from logic to solve problems within these areas and will
              use
logic as a basis for formulating new concepts and posing new
              problems
within them.  This project has the following main aspects: (a)
              further
development of Henson's logic for structures that are based on
              metric
spaces, especially on Banach spaces, and continued application of
              this
theory to problems in functional analysis; (b) study of
              exponentiation
and other elementary functions from the logical point of view;
              and (c)
continued investigation of the computational complexity of
              logical
decision problems, especially those arising in the most central
              areas
of mathematics.
     During the past 40 years or more, techniques from
              logic have not
only clarified the foundations of mathematics, but they have
              contributed
new tools for solving mathematical problems.  These tools have
              been
especially effective in those areas of mathematics that are close
              to
algebra and number theory.  In this project, C. Ward Henson aims to
make
              those tools from logic equally effective in the areas of mathematics
that are
              close to topology, geometry, and analysis.
