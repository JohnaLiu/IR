Clusters of Galaxies

Michael D. Gregg

Dr. Gregg is
              conducting  three distinct but complementary observational studies of clusters
              of galaxies.  
1. conducting a complete redshift survey over a 4s x 3s region
              of sky centered on the Fornax cluster.
2. studying the Coma cluster using a
              wide field CCD mosaiced imaging instrument at Kitt Peak National Observatory
              and the Canada Hawaii France Telescope.  The overall goal to understand how the
              interactions and evolution of galaxies and the cluster as a whole affect each
              other.
3. Using the Very Large Array's FIRST Survey to search for clusters of
              galaxies.
Although there are three projects, they are linked by a common
              science thread:  to understand clusters of galaxies.   This work provides a new
              way to search for large scale structure at great distances where optical and
              x-ray searches become ineffective.
