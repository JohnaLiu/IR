 This award supports the acquisition of a Philips XL30
              FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a backscattered electron detector,
              an integrated EDAX  non-dispersive X-ray microanalysis system, and a
              Cressington 208 HR turbo sputter coater.  The high-resolution XL30 and its
              support equipment will replace a 15 year old ISI SX40 SEM, that has extremely
              limited capabilities.  The XL30 will greatly enhance seven different research
              programs, four of which are presently supported by project grants from the
              National Science Foundation.  These research projects cover a wide range of
              topics, from the ultrastructure of dolphin blubber to the mechanisms whereby
              crustaceans and other organisms form calcified structures.  The wide range of
              topics described indicates how an instrument, and, in fact, microscopy as a
              whole can add to the scientific information to be gained from almost any set of
              experimental procedures.  The XL30 will also greatly enhance the range of
              analytical tools and training offered to graduate and undergraduate students at
              UNCW.
The XL30, because of its use of low accelerating voltages, allows one to
              view uncoated, as well as coated specimens. Investigators interested in
              biomineralization could, for example, examine the interface between calcite
              crystals and organic matrix in oyster shell with an atomic force microscope
              (AFM) after it has been visualized with the XL30.  The ability to capture a
              high resolution image and subsequently use multiple analytic tools (e.g. AFM,
              nuclear magnetic resonance, material testing, antibody probes) on the same
              specimen would greatly enhance the on-going research programs.  The X-ray
              analysis component, especially the mapping capabilities, will likewise enhance
              several programs.
The Microscopy Laboratory at UNCW is part of a growing
              Biological and Marine Sciences Program that includes a new 18 million dollar
              laboratory-sciences building and a 17 million dollar Marine Sciences Facility
              that is nearing completion.  In addition to supporting the specific programs
              described, National Science Foundation support of a XL30 would greatly increase
              the scope of the analytical and microscopic research possible at UNCW and
              enhance its growing basic research programs.
