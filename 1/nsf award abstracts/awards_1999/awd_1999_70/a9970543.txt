The objective of the project is to perform research in
              the theory of dynamical systems, mainly low-dimensional, both smooth and
              continuous.  
The Principal Investigator will apply analytical, topological
              and combinatorial tools in order to investigate real and complex systems. The
              main 
parts of the project are devoted to the study of the attractors for
              rational functions, rotation sets for maps of trees and graphs, entropy of the
              
2-dimensional golden mean shift (using methods developed for studying
              one-dimensional systems), and nonautonomous discrete dynamical 
systems, both
              low-dimensional and general.
For almost every phenomenon from Physics,
              Chemistry, Biology, Medicine, Economy and other sciences one can make a
              mathematical 
model that can be regarded as a dynamical system. Sometimes the
              study of this system is extremely difficult, but quite often it can be
              
reduced to the study of a much simpler, low dimensional one. This project is
              devoted mainly to the investigation of the properties of this type 
of systems
              from the mathematical point of view. The results that can be obtained are
              usually much stronger than in the general case.
