The goals of the research project 'Counting curves on higher
              dimensional complex projective manifolds' are1) to explicitly calculate the
              expected number of curves (one-complex-dimensional submanifolds) on higher
              dimensional manifolds in settings where one expects finitely many such curves,
              2) to determine when the expected number is actually realized by (rigid)
              curves.  One aim is to simplify recent advances by Givental, Yau, et al.
              carrying out 1) in the case of Calabi-Yau threefolds.  Another is to study the
              general deformation of a special situation in which the curves, although
              expected to be finite, actually move in families.

This project lies within
              the area of research called complex projective geometry, that is, the study of
              geometric properties of solutions of systems of polynomial equations in several
              variables.  The research is related to fundamental questions in quantum physics
              and differential equations.
