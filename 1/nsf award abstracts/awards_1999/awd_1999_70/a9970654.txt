Abstract: Lakic's
              project is concerned with four closely related topics in Teichmuller theory:
              asymptotic Teichmuller spaces, vector fields for holomorphic motions,
              substantial boundary points, and the variability set of a Riemann surface. The
              techniques he intends to use arise from two recently developed theories,
              asymptotic Teichmuller theory and the Teichmuller theory of closed planar sets.
              New insights into the hyperbolic geometry of plane domains are expected to
              emerge as a by-product of the research.  

Teichmuller spaces of closed sets
              have many applications to dynamics and hyperbolic geometry. The recently
              developed asymptotic Teichmuller spaces, for instance, serve as parameter
              spaces in the study of dynamical systems. Modern dynamical system theory has
              had a number of important applications, ranging from the life sciences and
              physics to economics. Several complicated biological phenomena (the rate of
              change in the population of a single species, to cite a concrete example) are
              modelled by nonlinear dynamical systems, making it imperative to understand the
              long-term behavior of these mathematical systems if knowledge of the
              corresponding bio-system is to be advanced. The research conducted under this
              award should provide dynamicists with some valuable tools for the study of
              various infinite dimensional dynamical systems.
