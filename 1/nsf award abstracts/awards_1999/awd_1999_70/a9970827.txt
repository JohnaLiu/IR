              Theoretical investigation of the inner accretion flow in active galactic

The centers of active galaxies are thought to contain
              supermassive black holes.  Surrounding these black holes are disks of matter
              that accrete material from the galaxy and feed it into the black hole.  The
              nature of the innermost regions of accretion flows into these supermassive
              black holes is poorly understood.  Most of the total power presumably
              originates in these sourves.  This is the region where the effects of general
              relativity are the strongest.  

Dr. Blaes  is investigating the properties
              of the inner accretion flow through two theoretical approaches: 

(1)The
              first approach consists of well posed, mathematical calculations of the
              interaction between the "photon-bubble" instability and the magnetorotational
              (Balbus-Hawley) instabilities; both of which should exists in the inner
              accretion flow and both of which will directly govern the dynamical and
              thermodynamical properties of the flow.

(2) The second approach concerns a
              more phenomenological modeling of a variety of possible geometries to try and
              fit the observed spectral and variability behavior.
