Abstract    :
              Grayson

     Grayson and his colleague Stillman collaborate in
              developing
the computer software system Macaulay 2, a symbolic
              computer
algebra program that supports large scale research
              computing
projects dealing with systems of polynomial equations in
              many
variables.  The program's many functions depend mainly on
variants of
              the Groebner basis algorithm for computing standard
bases and syzygies of
              ideals and modules over polynomial rings.
The results yield quantitative and
              qualitative information about
solutions of such systems of equations.  In this
              project the
investigators develop new algorithms, improve existing
              algorithms
and implementations, improve the documentation, add new
              features,
improve the program's efficiency, and make it more useable. 
              They
also provide a web-accessible computation server to
              facilitate
contributions from and collaborations between the
              Internet-based
community of users.  These interchanges improve the
              algorithms
and scope of Macaulay 2.  Stillman also continues his research
              in
computational commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, as well
as into
              problems involving generalized Green's conjectures,
Castelnuovo-Mumford
              regularity, toric varieties and binomial
ideals.  Grayson also continues his
              research into algebraic
K-theory concerning the connection between algebraic
              K-theory and
motivic cohomology as mediated by filtrations of the
              K-theory
space.
     The goal of this project is to turn Macaulay 2 into
              the
premiere collaborative research tool for mathematicians and
others around
              the world whose work involves systems of polynomial
equations.  Such research
              is important because systems of
polynomial equations arise whenever
              mathematics is used as a tool
in science, for example, in engineering, in
              physics, and in
biology.  The project extends the algorithms, efficiency,
              and
scope of Macaulay 2, provides an Internet server for users, and
provides
              an Internet-based forum for users to contribute Macaulay
2 packages and to
              collaborate on the solution of mathematics and
applications problems.  The
              project also involves the training of
students in both mathematics and
              symbolic computation.
