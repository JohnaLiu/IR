Abstract    :
              9970295

This is a project in algebraic geometry.  Ein proposes to  study
              complexity questions on computational problems concerning geometric objects
              defined by a system of algebraic equations.  In particular, he plans to study
              the complexity in finding the relations among the equations that define an
              irreducible variety.  Ein also proposes to study geometric properties of linear
              systems on algebraic varieties.

Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest
              branches of mathematics.  It studies geometric objects defined by algebraic
              equations.  Because of their rich structure and fundamental importance, these
              geometric objects have been studied extensively by mathematicians.  In recent
              years, mathematicians have found important applications of  algebraic geometry
              to mathematical physics, coding theory, compuatational science, number theory,
              and topology.
