This project deals with diophantine approximation and value
              distribution theory of holomorphic functions.  Work by C. Osgood, the Principal
              Investigator, and others has shown that these two fields are in fact connected
              by a formal analogy.  This observation has led to new conjectures, shorter
              proofs of existing theorems, and proofs of new theorems.  This project will
              extend the analogy, working primarily but not entirely in the field of
              diophantine approximation.

Number theory is the study of the properties of
              whole numbers and ]rational numbers.  A large part of this is devoted to
              studying whole-number and rational-number solutions to systems of polynomial
              equations.  One particular approach to this study has been to look at
              inequalities satisfied by such solutions.  This approach, called diophantine
              approximation, is often useful for proving that there are few integer or
              rational solutions to a given set of polynomial equations.
