A Composite
              Model Checking Toolset for Analyzing Software Systems

In this project a new
              automated verification technique for analyzing software specifications called
              composite model checking will be investigated. Model checking is a technique
              for searching the state space of a system to find out if it satisfies a given
              property. The success of model checking procedures rely on the efficiency of
              the data structures used to represent the states of  the system. In this
              project a composite model will be developed for combining multiple
              type-specific representations so that all variable types can be represented
              efficiently during the state space search. This way, representations such as
              Binary Decision Diagrams which are efficient for encoding Boolean variables
              will be combined with representations such as linear arithmetic constraints
              which can encode unbounded variables. A set of tools will be implemented to
              support composite model checking. The layered structure of the toolset will
              allow other researchers to use it at various levels 1) for testing the
              effectiveness of new representations; 2) for investigating various model
              checking strategies such as backward and forward search, partitioning and
              abstraction; or 3) for analyzing complex software specifications.
