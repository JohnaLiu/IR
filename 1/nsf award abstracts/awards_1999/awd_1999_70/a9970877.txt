Abstract    :
              Prof. Prince's group will develop improved algorithms for the detection of
              gravitational wave signals with LIGO and implement these algorithms in software
              that runs efficiently on parallel computers.  Specifically, they will implement
              improved algorithms for semi-coherent detection of periodic sources of
              gravitational waves and test these algorithms using data on x-ray pulsars and
              data from prototype interferometers.  They will also develop more efficient
              algorithms for generation of binary inspiral chirp templates using the
              stationary phase approximation. 
Algorithms for the detection of periodic
              sources and binary inspiral are central to achieving the science goals of LIGO.
               The next required step for LIGO is to develop efficient algorithms that run on
              multi-processor parallel computers and that are robust when applied to real
              data.
