Abstract    :
              This award partially funds a Special Year in Number Theory  at the University of
              Illinois in 1999/2000.  The Special Year will feature short and long term
              visits by international experts in Number Theory and culminate in  a major
              international meeting, the Millennial Conference on Number Theory, to be held
              on May 21 - 26, 2000, at the University of Illinois Campus at Urbana-Champaign.
               Several smaller meetings are also planned in conjunction with the Special
              Year, including a regional conference in Fall 1999; a graduate student
              conference in early 2000; and an instructional conference on Fermat's Last
              Theorem in the Summer 2000.  It is expected that these activities will help
              disseminate the latest advances in the field, foster interaction between
              leading researchers in Number Theory,  stimulate research in the area, and
              provide a major boost to the careers of young researchers and advanced graduate
              students in the area of Number Theory.


The Special Year falls into the
              general mathematical field of Number Theory. Number Theory has its history in
              the study of whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the
              divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest and richest
              branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic
              reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an indespensable
              tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing,
              cryptography, and communication systems.
