Knight
     This award will support mainly the travel of graduate
              students in
mathematical logic to professional meetings and to a lesser extent
              will
support travel of some outside speakers to the Notre Dame Logic
              Seminar,
which is also important for providing the broadest background in
              logic
for the students.  Finally, a small portion of the funds (about
              10%)
will enable the students to have permanent access to certain
              important
reference books.  Knight and her students are working on various
              aspects of
computable structure theory.  One student, Charles McCoy, has
              several results
connecting definability with complexity.  He is now trying to
              characterize
in a mathematical way the linear orderings and Boolean algebras
              with the
feature that between computable copies, there is always some
              isomorphism
at level two in the arithmetic hierarchy.  Another student, Andrew
              Arana,
is beginning work on models of arithmetic and enumerations.  Knight
              herself
will concentrate on problems involving existence of computable copies
              of
structures.  In particular, she hopes to extend the partial results
              of
Khisamiev on reduced Abelian p-groups with computable copies.  She
              is
interested in a question of Shore, on what statement could serve as
              a
computable non-structure theorem.  Knight has a side interest in
              systems
theory. 
     The area of computable structure, a new and arguably
              more suggestive
term for what has long been known as recursion theory, has its
              roots in the
discovery more than half a century ago of sets of integers for
              which no
algorithm exists to decide if a particular integer is a member. 
              Moreover,
another old result (from the 1950's) established that there are
              incomparable
sets of this type, i.e., two sets such that neither permits one
              to construct
the other from it in a mechanical way.  As a practical matter,
              one cares
about the speed and efficiency of algorithms and not their mere
              existence.
Nevertheless, understanding the inherent limits of algorithmic
              possibility
is an important philosophical accomplishment and triumph of the
              human
intellect, in a way the ultimate in self-knowledge.
