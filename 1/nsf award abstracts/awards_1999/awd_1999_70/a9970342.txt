This proposal deals with the  representation theory of reductive
              groups. The problems concern the relation of certain basic questions (arising
              in the Langlands program of automorphic forms) relating the nonvanishing of
              analytic invariants ( called automorphic L-functions) to the existence of
              functorial liftings conjectured in the Langlands program.  One very classical
              example of such phenomenon is the Waldspurger correspondence relating the
              existence of half integral weight forms to nonvanishing of classical
              L-functions at centers of symmetry.  We consider various methods of
              constructing functorial liftings. The program sets forth alternative methods to
              be studied.  The specific ideas used in these new methods include (1)the
              construction of new models for automorphic representations called Gelfand Graev
              models and (2) determination of tensor L-functions for the case of the direct
              product of GL(N) with a classical group.  We study formulae for certain
              specific values of automorphic L-functions and the construction of tempered L
              packets for classical groups.

This research is in the area of number theory.
               Number theory has its historical roots in the study of natural numbers.  It is
              among the oldest branches of mathematics.  Within the last half century it has
              become an indispensible tool in diverse applications in areas such as data
              transmission and processing, and communication systems.
