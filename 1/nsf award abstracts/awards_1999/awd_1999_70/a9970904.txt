Professors Boyer and Galicki propose to investigate
              several
projects in geometry and topology. The objective of all the
projects
              is to investigate fundamental questions in Riemannian
Geometry with the two
              main focal points, Contact Geometry and
Einstein Metrics.  The questions and
              problems proposed here are
based on the principal investigators' work which
              exploited a
fundamental relationship between contact geometry
              of
Sasakian-Einstein spaces and two particular kinds of Kaehler
geometry.
              These are the Q-factorial Fano varieties
(Kaehler-Einstein metrics with
              positive scalar curvature) and the
Calabi-Yau manifolds (Kaehler Ricci-flat
              metrics).  Our recent
work has led to a significant progress in studying many
              classical
problems as well as resulted in the development of completely
              new
techniques. Most notably, we were able to construct compact
locally
              irreducible positive scalar curvature Einstein spaces
with arbitrary second
              Betti number in any odd dimension greater
than 5. We now are at the point
              where several classification
problems and conjectures described in this
              proposal appear to be
within our reach. Furthermore, the type of Einstein
              geometry that
we are studying has recently become of interest in
              Theoretical
Physics in the context of superconformal field theory and
              string
theory, and gives our work an interdisciplinary flavor.

Mathematics
              is the foundation upon which our modern technology is
built, and much of its
              understanding and development must preceed
technological progress. 
              Nevertheless, our research into a
particular type of geometry is closely
              linked to some important
problems in modern Theoretical Physics and should
              provide an
important mathematical basis for their understanding.
