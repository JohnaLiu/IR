Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT - 9970402
The microscopy of living processes has undergone a minor
              renaissance in recent years. Of particular importance has been the use of
              genetic and microinjected fluorescent probes to track and tease apart dynamic
              processes in living cells and tissues. In this grant, funds have been provided
              by the National Science Foundation to purchase a state-of-the-art
              microinjection and microscope imaging system.  This equipment will be used by
              basic science researchers at the College of Charleston, Medical University of
              South Carolina and NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center. The projects
              include applications in genetic analysis of green fluorescent protein
              expression in living zebrafish embryos; following migratory behavior of
              fluorescently tagged cells in tissue culture; dynamic measurement of
              cell-to-cell communication in developmental processes; and fluorescent tracking
              of toxins in developing fish embryos. The interdisciplinary groups using this
              equipment have proven commitments to education and strong records of providing
              opportunities for young people to experience work in a professional research
              environment.  These include students at all levels from high school to
              post-doctoral trainees-with special emphasis on encouraging minority
              participation in science. This grant by the NSF will contribute significantly
              to scientific research and education infrastructure in the Charleston, South
              Carolina area.
