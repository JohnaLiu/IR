This Americas Program award will jointly fund, together with
              the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences, the attendance of 10 junior faculty
              and graduate students from the United States to the Householder Symposium XIV
              on Numerical Algebra to be held June 14-18, 1999 in Whistler, British Columbia.
              The activity is being organized by the Householder Program Committee, together
              with the SIAM Activity Group in Linear Algebra.  

This multi-national
              symposium is held once every three years to review advances in numerical
              algebra and to foster new collaborative efforts. The meeting brings together
              theoreticians, numerical analysts, and application researchers from all over
              the world.  Selection of US junior faculty and students will be made by
              soliciting applications through electronic bulletin board announcements and
              advertisements in cognizant journals.
