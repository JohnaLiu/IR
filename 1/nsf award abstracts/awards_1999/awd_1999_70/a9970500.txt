Abstract    :
              This research project focuses on algebraic varieties, the geometric objects
              defined by the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations.  Varieties
              will be studied through their Chow groups.  The Chow group of a variety is the
              free abelian group on subvarieties modulo the subgroup of elements which are
              rationally equivalent to zero.  Although the Chow group is known to have good
              abstract, functorial properties little is known about its structure for most
              varieties.  The goal of the project is to make progress towards a better
              understanding of various aspects of this structure.  The torsion in the Chow
              group will be studied as will the relationship between the Chow group and
              various cohomology groups.  Furthermore, the quotient of the Chow group by the
              relation of algebraic equivalence will be investigated.  Special properties
              which occur when the variety is defined over a finite field will also be
              studied.

The line of investigation pursued in this project continues
              historical investigations with roots in the 19-th century.  The research should
              contribute to a better understanding of the geometric figures defined by the
              solution sets to systems of polynomial equations.  It is also motivated by a
              large body of conjectures, some recent and some quite old, which predict a
              beautiful and subtle relationship between geometry and the theory of numbers.
