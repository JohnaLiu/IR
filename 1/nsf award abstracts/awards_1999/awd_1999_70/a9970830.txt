Abstract    :
              The purpose of the proposed study is to address the following research question:
               How does teacher leadership work, as configured in USIs, help to develop and
              sustain SMT education reform on scale?  The planned research will test the
              following hypothesis about the nature of teacher leadership work in USI
              sites:

Teacher leadership, when geared toward supporting the learning of
              other classroom teachers, is a powerful strategy for helping districts get to
              scale with science, mathematics, and technology education reform.

A
              two-tiered sampling strategy is proposed-a purposeful sampling of USI sites and
              a purposeful sampling of teacher leaders within each site.   Working with
              approximately seven USI sites, the methodology includes collection and analysis
              of USI documents, surveys, on-site observations and focus group discussions,
              and interviews with selected teacher leaders, principals, and districts office
              staff.
