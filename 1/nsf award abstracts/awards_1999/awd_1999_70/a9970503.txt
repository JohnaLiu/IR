Abstract    :
              This proposal brings together three researchers who will as a team use
their
              diverse backgrounds and expertise to tackle a number of
inter-connected
              inverse problems arising from differential geometry and
partial differential
              equations, each having a natural physical
interpretation.  The specific
              problems include a dynamic version of the
classical boundary rigidity problem
              for Riemannian metrics and its
connection to the hyperbolic Dirichlet to
              Neumann map, an inverse problem
for anisotropic electromagnetic bodies, and
              the detection of obstacles or
cracks in an inhomogeneous conducting body from
              electrostatic measurements
performed on the boundary.

The field of inverse
              problems addresses the problem of determining
information about the interior
              of an object without destroying it, or
cutting it open.  One may send in
              waves: light waves, x-rays, or
ultrasound, and analyze the transmitted waves
              which have been scattered by
an unknown interior (scattering theory); or one
              may make boundary
measurements of solutions to boundary value problems, the
              solutions of
which depend on the material properties of the interior (inverse
              boundary
value problems).  Some of the problems discussed in this proposal
              also
have applications to: electrical impedance tomography (application of
              a
voltage potential to the boundary of a body and measurement of the
              induced
current at the boundary yields information about the interior),
              medical
imaging by ultrasound, non-destructive testing in industry (for cracks
              or
wear in airplane wings, for instance), and seismology and oil
              exploration
(the travel time of acoustic waves is used to reconstruct the
              earth's
substructure).
