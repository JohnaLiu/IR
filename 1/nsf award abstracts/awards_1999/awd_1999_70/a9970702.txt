It is proposed to study several problems related to tight
              closure, 
including the long open question as to whether it commutes with
              
localization, the relationship of tight closure with Hilbert-Kunz
              
functions, the problem of characterizing tight closure in equal
              
characteristic zero in new ways that will produce better insight 
into the
              phenomenon, and the central problem of extending the 
underlying idea to rings
              that do not necessarily contain a field, which 
would solve many open
              questions, including the long standing conjecture 
that regular rings are
              direct summands of their module-finite 
extension rings. 

Commutative
              algebra and algebraic geometry may be thought of 
as studying solutions of
              many equations in many unknowns 
when, typically, the solution is not unique.
              The set of 
solutions can then be viewed geometrically, but one 
can use
              instead encode all the pertinent information about 
the equations in abstract
              algebraic objects called commutative 
rings. The two points of view interact
              in beautiful and 
productive ways. A breakthrough method in commutative
              algebra that 
has had explosive development in this decade is the theory of
              tight 
closure. Part of the underlying idea is to consider the system 
of
              equations, after suitable modification, or the ring, modulo 
many different
              prime integers. This is a powerful technique 
that has solved many problems,
              while opening up vast new 
areas for research.
