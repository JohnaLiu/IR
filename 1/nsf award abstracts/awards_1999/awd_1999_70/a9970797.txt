Abstract    :
              
The present day distribution of galaxies is inhomogeneous.  The universe at
              the time of the cosmic microwave background (CNB) is isotropic and smooth.  A
              critical problem in modern cosmology is the reconciliation of the two.  The CMB
              provides an extremely uniform back light to the observable universe.  When one
              views the CMB through a cluster of galaxies, the CMB spectrum is distorted
              because the CMB interacts with the hot, ionized plasma that is gravitationally
              bound in clusters of galaxies.  This effect is known as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovitch
              effect..  The thermal and bulk velocities of the electrons in the hot plasma
              produce spectral distortions that  can be only distinguished from one another
              by multi frequency observations at 100 to 300 GHz.  

Dr. Church is
              continuing a program of research that uses the Sunyaev-Zel'dovitch Infrared
              Experiment (SuZIE).  This is a bolometric array receiver that observes at 143,
              217, 350 GHz.  The instrument is designed to measure the thermal and kinematic
              components of the SZ effect with high precision.  Dr. Church is extending the
              sample of SZ derived peculiar velocities at z greater than or equal to 0.1 to a
              sample of 60, with an expected precision of 250-700 km/s per cluster; and also
              measuring the arcminute scale anisotropy of the CMB with a precision of 10 mK
              per 1.5' pixel over 0.5 sq degree, thus mapping out the CMB power spectrum from
              l = 1000 to 3500.
