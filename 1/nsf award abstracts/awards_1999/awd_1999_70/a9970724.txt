Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical physics will include work on large effects of quantum
              chromodynamics, with an emphasis on the physics behind the confinement of
              quarks. Quantum chromodynamics is the theory, well accepted by now, describing
              the strong nuclear interactions. A phenomenon of central importance in quantum
              chromodynamics is the confinement of quarks, which constitute the building
              blocks of protons and neutrons, i.e., of all atomic nuclei. We need to
              understand why these quarks are always confined  within complex physical
              systems, and never appear in isolation. The proposed investigations are
              therefore very important in understanding the strong nuclear forces.
