Abstract    :
              9970357

This proposal is about connections between the Regular Inverse Galois
              Problem and two other topics:  Firstly, the theory of the middle convolution
              developed by N. Katz in his book " Rigid Local Systems", published in 1996; and
              secondly, certain questions raised by  Frey and  Kani about genus 2 covers of
              elliptic curves and related arithmetic properties of elliptic curves.

Galois
              theory, the study of  symmetries between solutions of high degree algebraic
              equations, has been a centerpiece of algebra for hundreds of years.  Recent
              developments of both theoretical and applied nature --- namely, the
              classification of finite simple groups as well as the advent of powerful
              computer algebra systems ---have rekindled a lot of research activity in Galois
              theory, centering around the Inverse Problem of Galois Theory, one of the major
              open problems of mathematics:  The question which type of symmetries can occur
              (among the solutions of algebraic equations).
