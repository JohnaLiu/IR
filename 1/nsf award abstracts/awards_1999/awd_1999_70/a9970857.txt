ABSTRACT

Our mathematical research centers around the
              following
problems in partial differential equations of both
theoretical and
              practical interest.
The first part is concerned with the regularity of
              solutions
for the sum of squares operator, or  sublaplacian.
We will
              investigate necessary and
sufficient conditions for the local and global
              analytic regularity of the
sublaplacian when the bracket condition is
              satisfied.
Moreover, in the absence of the bracket condition we will
              study
the weaker properties of global analytic and smooth regularity
of the
              sublaplacian on the  torus.
Also we will consider regularity problems for CR
              structures,
and principal type operators.
The second part is concerned with
              the study
of the Cauchy problem for nonlinear partial differential
              equations
of shallow water type under low regularity initial data
using
              harmonic analysis techniques. In particular we
plan to investigate the local
              and global well-posedness of the
initial value problem for the completely
              integrable
Camassa-Holm equation.
And finally, in the third part we plan to
              show that the exponential map of
an appropriate metric on the group of
              volume--preserving diffeomorphisms of a
compact riemannian manifold  is a
              nonlinear Fredholm map of
index zero. This would be significant because, as is
              well known,
geodesics of this metric correspond to solutions of the
              Euler
equations of hydrodynamics.


Partial differential equations is a
              many-faceted subject.
Our understanding of the fundamental processes of the
              natural world
is based to a large extent on partial differential
              equations.
For example, the equations considered in the first part of
              our
proposal arise in the diffusion of chemicals, in the spread of heat,
and
              in many other physical processes influenced by diffusion.
Moreover diffusion
              processes are closely connected to
random (Brownian) motions. The synthesis of
              the theory of these
diffusion partial differential equations and probability

              provides the theoretical framework for studying problems
where diffusion and
              randomness are present. An example outside
mathematics and physics is the
              field of Finance, where powerful techniques from
stochastic analysis have been
              brought to bear on almost all aspects of
mathematical finance: pricing of
              financial derivative products such
as options and bonds, hedging, interest
              rates and so on.
The equations in the second and third parts arise from
              problems in
hydrodynamics. They are mathematical models describing
fluid
              flow. The study of these equations will contribute
in our understanding of
              wave formation, the structure of their
singularities, and
their long time
              behavior. It may also contribute in the very
big problem of understanding
              turbulence.
At the same time the theory for studying these partial
              differential
equations problems forms a vast subject  that interacts with many
              other
branches
of mathematics, such as complex analysis, differential
              geometry, harmonic
analysis, probability, and mathematical physics.
