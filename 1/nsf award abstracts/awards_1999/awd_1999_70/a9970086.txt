     The investigator develops and uses mathematical models
              and
tools to study a variety of problems in physiology organized
around the
              theme of excitability and wave propagation.  The three
main interconnected
              thrusts for this work are: 1) to develop
mathematical models that can be used
              to describe specific
physiological phenomena; 2) to develop analytical
              techniques,
numerical algorithms, and computational tools to study the
              model
equations; 3) to use analytical and numerical tools to understand
the
              behavior of these systems and to thereby better understand
the underlying
              physiological processes.  The physiological
problems are drawn from four
              specific areas: 1) cardiology and
the problems of fibrillation onset and
              defibrillation; 2) calcium
dynamics and excitation-contraction coupling in
              cardiac cells; 3)
the role of microtubule networks in the transport of
              chemicals
throughout a cell; 4) the involvement and spatial spread
              of
bacteria in chemical reactions, such as mine tailings dumps,
water
              treatment plants, oil spills, etc.
     The common thread running through this
              work is that chemical
signals underlie motion, and this work is directed
              toward an
understanding of how chemical signals are generated,
              controlled,
and how they mediate motion.  Such an understanding is a
              crucial
first step toward solving several important health-related
              and
environmentally related problems.  Specifically, an
              improved
understanding of the heartbeat and how and why it fails could
give
              new clues as to how to prevent or cure some dangerous
cardiac disorders. 
              Similarly, an improved understanding of how
bacteria (and other living cells)
              move and regulate their motion
could lead to improved organic control of toxic
              chemical wastes.
