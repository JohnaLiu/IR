Discovering Software Process Measures
              Using Genetic Programming is a research project that is developing automated
              methods for finding algorithms that measure novel and useful attributes of
              software development processes using genetic programming.  A cost-effective
              strategy for assuring high quality software is to target enhancement activities
              to those modules that are most likely to have faults.  When the methods being
              developed by this project are applied to a software development project, the
              resulting software process metrics will be novel, specialized for the
              development organization, and useful for predicting software quality.  Genetic
              programming is a promising technology that is well-suited to searching for
              novel combinations of algorithmic elements that satisfy complex criteria.  This
              project's contributions to the state of the art are empirical exploration of
              data stored by feature tracking systems and problem reporting systems to
              discover software process metrics that are useful as independent variables in
              software quality models, an automated method for goal-driven discovery and
              measurement of specialized software process metrics using genetic programming,
              and a demonstration of the application of genetic programming to a new domain,
              namely, software measurement.  This improvement in the state of the art will
              enable software developers to achieve practical, cost-effective process
              improvement guided by predictions from software quality models at a new level
              of accuracy and robustness.
