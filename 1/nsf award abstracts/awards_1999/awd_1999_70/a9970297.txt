Abstract    :
              The project is devoted to two related topics, namely nonlinear
              hyperbolic
equations and partial differential equations with nonsmooth
              coefficients.
The hyperbolic equations we consider are either semilinear (such
              as
the critical Wave-Maps and Yang Mills equations), for which one hopes
              to
obtain
both local and global results, or nonlinear, for which the aim  is
              to
improve
the local theory. The problems related to partial differential
              equations
with nonsmooth coefficients are mostly inspired by nonlinear pde's;
              this
includes various Strichartz and Carleman type estimates, as well
              as
hyperbolic
boundary value problems.


The equations of interest for
              this project can be loosely described as
models for wave-like phenomena, such
              as generalized relativity and
nonlinear ellasticity. While many physical
              models are genuinely nonlinear, 
their mathematical analysis
is extremely
              difficult, often beyond the current mathemathical theory;
thus,
in most cases
              we contend ourselves with simplified models which are linear
or only mildly
              nonlinear. The proposed work is part of a larger program
whose aim is to
              understand such fully nonlinear equations. The strategy is
to study a sequence
              of increasingly difficult model problems which get
closer and
closer to the
              relevant physical model, so that at each step some new
nonlinear feature is
              understood.
