Bunimovich

The proposal deals with the properties of finite- and
              infinite-dimensional dynamical systema. Both topological and ergodic properties
              are addressed.  The systems under study include nonlinear hyperbolic partial
              differential equations, lattice dynamical systems (in particular, coupled map
              lattices), lattice gas cellular automata, billiards and the systems of
              interacting particles. The broad approach will be used that combines methods of
              the ergodic theory, the theory of nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems and
              the theory of bifurcations.

Most of the questions that will be addressed in
              this proposal have their origin in statistical physics, geometrical optics,
              hydrodynamics and biology and were transformed into the mathematical form by
              the principal investigator with collaborators. The new applications under study
              address the dynamical systems which naturally appear in manufacturing,
              especially in the dynamics of production lines. The application of ideas and
              methods of dynamical systems allowed already to increase production rates of
              such lines e.g. in the apparel industry. The major effort will be made now in
              the analysis of reentrant manufacturing systems which deal e.g. with the
              production od the semiconductors.
