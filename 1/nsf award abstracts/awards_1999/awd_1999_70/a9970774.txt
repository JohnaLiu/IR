The project is concerned with new directions in which
              unitary representations may be used to study the geometry, dynamics and ergodic
              theory of semisimple groups and their discrete subgroups.  Rigidity phenomena
              in the framework of representation theory will be presented, which have direct
              implications to rigidity of actions and homomorphisms of lattices, both in rank
              one and in higher rank simple Lie groups.  New tools in the rigidity  theory 
              of quasi-isometries of amenable groups will be introduced and investigated as
              well, using this approach.

The concept of symmetry is of fundamental
              importance in mathematical analysis, and underlies many of nature's secrets. In
              studying and using this concept, the theory of Lie groups and the way they
              arise and operate as symmetries of geometric objects (such as a ball), is a
              central theme.  Independently, the mathematical theory of Hilbert spaces
              -highly symmetric infinite dimensional analogous of balls (consisting of, say,
              sequences of numbers)- has found remarkable applications in diverse scientific
              areas, such as designing efficient networks, quantum mechanics and elementary
              particle physics. While connections between the above two themes are known, and
              exploited, the aim of this project is to open completely new directions in
              which they relate. In doing so, techniques from both theories will be used, and
              new tools  will be introduced, which will enable a better understanding of
              these two important subjects.
