This project studies the arithmetic of Shimura varieties, abelian
              varieties, motives, and related objects, including the following specific
              problems:  define a good category of abelian motives over a finite field
              without assuming the Tate conjecture; the conjecture of Langlands and Rapoport
              concerning the structure of Shimura varieties in nonzero characteristic;
              canonical integral models of Shimura varieties in the case of bad reduction;
              the degeneration of abelian motives and its application to the study of
              compactifications of Shimura varieties; mixed motives with integer coefficients
              over finite fields.

The proposal is in the area of arithmetic geometry,
              which studies solutions of systems of polynomial equations over arithmetically
              interesting rings or fields, such as the ring of integers or the field of
              rational numbers.  It also includes the study of  higher dimensional analogues
              of elliptic curves, namely, abelian varieties, and their generalizations,
              motives.  This material is in the meeting ground between arithmetic and
              geometry.
