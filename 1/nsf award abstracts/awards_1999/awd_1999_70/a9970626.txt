This project concerns two topics in
              representation theory.  The first is to attain a deeper understanding of
              representations of p-adic groups by studying the behavior of affine Hecke
              algebras under extension of scalars. It appears that such algebras will
              completely control the representation theory of p-adic groups. The second
              project is to investigate an explicit family of highest weight vectors in
              tensor products of representations of GLn. These appear to be the first such
              explicitly given family. The main question is, whether they in
fact span the
              space of all highest weight vectors.

Representation theory is a major
              mathematical technique for exploiting the presence of symmetry. For example,
              the structure of the hydrogen atom, one of the fundamental computations in
              quantum mechanics, is controlled by representation theory. Another way of
              thinking about representation theory is as a generalization of the theory of
              eigenvalues and matrices that many people see in a college course on basic
              linear algebra. This project addresses two important questions in
              representation theory. One potentially has important applications to number
              theory. The other concerns a generalization of the  theory of angular momentum
              in quantum mechanics. It will help describe how  pair  of interacting quantum 
              mechanical systems of a rather general type  breaks up into simpler systems.
