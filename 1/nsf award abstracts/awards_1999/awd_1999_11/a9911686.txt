Abstract    :
              The NBER Summer Institute brings together economists from universities,
              government, and international organizations for a few days, or a few weeks of
              seminars, workshops, conferences and collaborative research.  The 1998 Summer
              Institute included 939 economists  from 201 universities and nonacademic
              institutions, 61 percent of these participants were not affiliated with the
              NBER. An effort is made to reach out to new participants, and 20 percent of the
              1998 participants were attending Summer Institute for the first time.  The
              Summer Institute provides a unique opportunity for economists to work closely
              with others in their areas of specialty for extended and intense periods of
              research. There are many opportunities at various conferences for researchers
              to spend an hour or two interacting with colleagues, but the NBER Summer
              Institute is unique in that it lasts long enough to allow serious collaboration
              among economists from several institutions. While there are, of course,
              presentations of work nearing completion, emphasis is placed on the "workshop"
              aspects of the program, where new ideas are raised, preliminary research ideas
              are developed, and plans for joint or coordinated research efforts are
              established.  The Summer Institute is organized into twelve programs, or areas
              of study: economic fluctuations, economic history, monetary economics,
              corporate finance, asset pricing, industrial organization, health and aging,
              international studies, labor studies, productivity, and taxation. Each program
              has its own group of participants, and its own group structure. Although there
              is considerable variation among the programs, a typical Summer Institute
              program will last for one to three weeks, with seminars each morning, and
              afternoons devoted to research. Programs may include a variety of subjects or
              they may be organized around specific topics.
