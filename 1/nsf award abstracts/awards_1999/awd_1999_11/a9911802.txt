Abstract    :
              The Anatomy of a Ridge Axis Discontinuity (ARAD) 3-D seismic experiment is a
              cooperative experiment between Scripps Institution of Oceanography and
              Cambridge University.  The field experiment was conducted aboard the R/V Ewing
              in Septemer-October 1997 and was located over the 9 degrees north overlapping
              spreading center on the East Pacific Rise.  Key elements of this experiment
              included the first 3-D reflection survey of a mid-ocean spreading center and a
              coincident 3-D crustal tomography experiment.  Preliminary data analysis
              suggests that the observed distribution of crustal magma accumulations beneath
              the overlapping spreading enter appear to be inconsistent with either a simple,
              broadly symmetrical structure or with models which depict the lims at
              attenuated ends of magmatic systems fed largely y horizontal flow.  Instead the
              magma seems to be fed from directly eneath the offset basin.  Further analyses
              are planned during the period of this grant.
