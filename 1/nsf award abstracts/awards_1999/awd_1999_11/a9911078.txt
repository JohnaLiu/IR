              System Research

The Department of Electrical Engineering at Princeton
              University will purchase a high-end server, workstations, networking hardware,
              and CAD tools, which will be dedicated to support research in computer
              engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research projects, all
              generally in the areas of Computer Architecture, Computer-Aided Design, and
              particularly focused on advancing design and architecture techniques for
              embedded systems and systems-on-a chip.

In a fundamental paradigm shift
              system design in the semiconductor industry, entire systems are being built on
              a single chip, using multiple embedded functional blocks called cores.  This
              has been made possible by the ever-increasing density of chips.  The current
              0.25-micron technology has made it possible to integrate tens of millions of
              transistors on one chip, and considerable interest is focused on discussing
              what the contents of billion-transistor systems-on- a-chip (SOCs) ought to
              be.

We propose to develop algorithms and tools to provide key technologies
              with breakthrough potential to semiconductor companies,and to develop efficient
              software environments and tools to deal with all aspects of the SOC design
              problem.
