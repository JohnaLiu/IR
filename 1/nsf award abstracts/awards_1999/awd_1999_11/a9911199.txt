This award will provide funding to help U.S. graduate students,
              postdoctoral fellows, and assistant professors  attend the Fifth International
              Marine Biotechnology Conference to be held in Townsville, Australia, from
              September 29th to October 5th, 2000.  This meeting is the premier international
              marine biotechnology conference and emphasizes the use of molecular approaches
              in studying the protection and enhancement of global marine resources.
              Societal, legal, and commercial issues are also covered.   The meeting will
              help US scientists  establish international collaborations and will foster the
              dissemination of the latest global advances in this area.
