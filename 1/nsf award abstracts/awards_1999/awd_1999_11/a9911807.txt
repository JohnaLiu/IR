This project builds the professional infrastructure needed
              to identify and organize web links that augment science instruction.  The NSTA
              SciLINKS program provides standards-based links keyed to textbooks.  Educators
              are the key to identifying those links, and this project establishes that core
              group of educators and the protocols, and it assesses the effectiveness and
              usefulness of such online materials.  It also ensures that the sites are
              consistent with the NSES and that there is open access for all science
              teachers, parents and other stakeholders.  Forty teachers participate in the
              first summer, thirty are added the second, and twenty more the final summer. 
              They develop the coding process that identifies high quality web-based
              materials and they engage in professional development on how web resources can
              be correlated to the National Science Education Standards and the Benchmarks. 
              In addition, the project provides an interactive web site to share information
              and to develop and distribute a Guidebook for Web Assessment.

Extensive
              evaluation is included to determine the usefulness of the sites.   Online
              monitoring is done of registered users, and sessions at national conferences
              are used for dissemination and to provide feedback to the developers.  Two
              layers of advisory groups guide the efforts.
