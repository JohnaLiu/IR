Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are three-fold: (1) to document to what degree and in
              what ways late 19th-century American businesses incorporated gender and racial
              ideology into images of American identity in order to sell "civilization" and
              their products overseas, (2) to examine how, in turn, images of the commercial
              empire were used to sell products at home, and by so doing, (3) to contribute
              to our theoretical understanding of the relationships between imperialism,
              national identity, gender, and "race."  This research will focus on the
              transformations of the image of the American garden -- the symbolic space of
              American nation-building -- as it was used to construct and legitimize American
              commercial expansion in the late 19th century.  The goals will be accomplished
              through an analysis of: (1) images of American identity used as promotional
              devices and corporate advertisements at the 1876 and 1893 Expositions, and (2)
              advertising campaigns of select American corporations who were successful in
              selling their products overseas in the late 19th century (Singer, McCormick,
              Heinz, Colgate-Palmolive, Kodak), and (3) the use of such images in popular
              19th-century journals.  The project will involve the use of different
              methodologies appropriate to the diverse range of source material (corporate
              archives, manuscript collections, advertising histories, contemporary
              guidebooks and pamphlets, 19th-century journals).

This research will provide
              the first empirical study of the ideological underpinnings of American
              commercial imperialism, and will advance our understanding of the relationships
              between American imperialism and national identity in the late 19th century. 
              This empirical work will contribute to our theoretical understanding of the
              links between notions of "race," gender, national identity, and imperialism in
              late 19th-century America.  By so doing, this study should provide a necessary
              context for understanding the on-going cultural and economic dominance of the
              United States over large portions of the world based on the selling of its
              consumer products.
