Abstract    :
              

To understand how the earth's climate might change in response to
              anthropogenic influence, such as the burning of fossil fuel, it is necessary to
              understand the natural variability of climate over glacial/interglacial times.
              One method of studying this variability is through investigation of the
              deep-sea sedimentary record, which contains chemical, fossil and mineralogic
              evidence of past climatic conditions. A potentially important signal in the
              sediments is the ratio of Ge to Si in opal, which varies in response to
              changing ocean conditions. To derive the maximum use of this tool, its chemical
              behavior in the sea floor must be fully understood. Therefore, this work will
              study the fractionation of Ge and Si in ocean sediments by laboratory
              experiments that would create a controlled diagenetic setting to determine the
              incorporation of Ge and Si into iron oxyhydroxices and sulfides.  Additionally,
              existing pore water samples will be analyzed to investigate the behavior of Ge
              in different ocean settings.  Field Studies in the California borderland will
              be carried out to collect additional pore waters and to deploy in-situ benthic
              chambers to measure the fractionation Ge and Si in different environments.
