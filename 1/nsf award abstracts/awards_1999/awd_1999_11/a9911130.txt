Abstract    :
              Perceptual discriminations between complex sounds such as those of speech and
              music are cued by differences along multiple dimensions, including pitch,
              loudness, duration, and timbre; these differences may occur simultaneously or
              sequentially, and may be distributed over a wide range of frequencies. While
              differences along some target dimensions contribute effectively to extricate
              the sounds, differences along other dimensions contribute little or nothing,
              and are therefore irrelevant. Complex-sound discriminations depend not only on
              the ability to attend to and integrate information arising from target
              dimensions, but also on the ability to ignore or filter out information arising
              from irrelevant dimensions. Previous research on perception of target and
              irrelevant dimensions has employed mainly speeded-classification tasks; the
              present investigation employs an adaptive, forced choice procedure. On each
              trial of the experimental task, a standard sound will be followed by two
              comparison sounds; relative to the standard, both comparisons will contain an
              irrelevant loudness difference, but only one randomly-chosen comparison will
              contain also a target pitch difference; human listeners will be asked to
              determine which comparison contains the target difference. Discrimination of
              target-irrelevant differences will be studied as a function of three variables:
              frequency and level separation between target and irrelevant differences,
              positive or negative polarity of irrelevant loudness differences, and amount of
              task training. The experiments are expected to shed light on the roles of
              perceptual grouping, relational pitch cues, and long-term memory on
              discrimination of target-irrelevant dimensions; in doing so, the experiments
              will increase our understanding of how people perceive multidimensional
              auditory displays.
