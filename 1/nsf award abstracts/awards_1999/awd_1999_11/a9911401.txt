This project will develop model curriculum units designed to
              produce deeper conceptual understandings in areas of the life sciences (Energy
              and the Human Body) that involve complex visual models.  The curriculum for
              grades 7-9 will be subdivided into five distinct units of study:  cell
              structure and function (cellular respiration emphasis), pulmonary respiration,
              circulatory system, digestive system, and relationship of respiration and
              ecosystems.  The curriculum will require six weeks to cover a few of the units,
              several months to a semester to cover all of the units, and can be integrated
              with existing curricula or used as a stand-alone program.  The curriculum will
              be comprised of a teacher's guide, student workbooks and a CD-ROM.  The units
              will be developed in conjunction with a team of middle school teachers and will
              also utilize findings from current research on learning that have developed
              instructional methods for teaching complex visual models in biology.  Learning
              outcomes will be assessed using transfer problems and alternative assessment
              tools that measure integrated conceptual understanding.
