The Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research
              (IAI) was created by an international agreement concluded among representatives
              of American States, namely the Agreement Establishing the Inter-American
              Institute for Global Change Research, done at Montevideo on May 13, 1992 ("the
              IAI Agreement").  The IAI Agreement created an intergovernmental organization
              for the purposes of coordinating and promoting scientific research related to
              global change.  The Institute has an evolving "Scientific Agenda" identifying
              particular areas for research.  Full membership in the IAI is limited to
              States, although the IAI Agreement also provides for non-State entities to
              become "Associates of the Institute."
The Institute is governed by an annual
              Conference of the Parties, and by a subsidiary Executive Council (EC).  The US
              Government currently serves on the EC.  The Institute has a permanent
              secretariat, the "Directorate."  The procedures and practices of the IAI's
              governing institutions are elaborated in detailed rules of procedure.  The IAI
              thus possesses the fundamental institutional characteristics of an
              international organization:  it was created by international agreement, is
              composed of States and is governed by governing bodies composed of
              representatives of States.
The US Government participates actively in the IAI.
               The United States played a leading role in the creation of the IAI and has
              been an active participant in the IAI since its creation.  Senior US Government
              officials serve on the Executive Council and hold other responsible positions
              related to IAI activities.  Furthermore, the IAI has been listed by the State
              Department and by the Office of Personnel Management as an international
              organization within the meaning of the Federal Employees International
              Organization Service Act, covered by 5 U.S.C. 3343 and 5 U.S.C. 3581.
Core
              Budget support, for which this proposal is submitted, allows the operation of
              the Directorate of the IAI.  Currently, the IAI Directorate is hosted by Brazil
              in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo state, on the campus of the Brazilian
              National Space Research Institute (INPE), where the IAI Directorate functions
              as an internationally recognized juridical personality, with the corresponding
              privileges and immunities granted by the Government of Brazil.
The IAI
              receives Core Budget contributions from the other Parties to the Agreement
              Establishing the IAI:  Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,
              Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama,
              Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.  Amounts are arrived at by consensus at
              an annual meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the IAI
              Agreement.

              Foundation is the lead U.S. Government agency designated by the White House to
              carry out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.
