This is a
              collaborative proposal with Principal Investigators from the Universities of
              Colorado, Alaska, and the Desert Research Institute.   Large portions of
              Siberia, Alaska, and northwestern Canada formed an unglaciated land-mass during
              the late Pleistocene known as Beringia.  Previous Beringian paleoclimatic
              studies have yielded only qualitative temperature estimates. There is a need to
              develop quantitative estimates to gain a better understanding of the magnitude
              and regional expression of climate change.  The Principal Investigators will
              attempt to quantify the paleotemperatures through the analysis of fossil
              insects, pollen, and plant macrofossils using thermoluminescence (TL) dating.
              They will use the Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) method of fossil beetle analysis
              and paleobotanical studies to produce estimates of mean temperatures of the
              warmest (TMAX) and coldest months (TMIN), as well as estimates of mean annual
              temperature (MAT).  They will reconstruct past environments at the five study
              sites in central and northern Alaska with sediments ranging in age from the end
              of isotope stage 6 to the Holocene.  The Principal Investigators will focus on
              samples from just before and during the last interglacial interval.  They will
              date sediments from 140-50 thousand years by TL and its newer variant,
              photon-stimulated-luminescence. 

Two research themes will be addressed.  The
              first theme is to study the nature of the climatic transition of stage 6 to
              stage 5 and to determine where the Old Crow tephra fits in this sequence.  The
              second research theme is to determine the nature of climatic amelioration in
              Beringia during the last interglacial period.
