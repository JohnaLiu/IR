'A Study of Place" integrates geographic visualization
              technologies into the study of earth science and geography at the middle
              school.  Two modules, each of four to six weeks duration, are "The Antarctic
              Continent:  Ice Climate and Exploration,' and  'The Atlantic and Its Coasts: 
              Currents and Commerce.'  Each module is driven by science and geography
              standards and has a common sequence.  A dilemma or mystery of an historical
              event in a particular geographic setting frames the unit.  Central earth
              science concepts are developed in tandem with investigative, image analysis,
              and mapping skills.  Core understandings are built in the context of current
              research.  A parallel study in a related or extended setting is carried out and
              becomes the assessment. The materials use satellite images, advanced geographic
              visualizations and other computer technologies.  The materials are disseminated
              on the Web as are teacher guides that support teachers in their learning to use
              non-traditional classroom strategies.
