Abstract    :
              This is a cooperative project among US, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Japanese
              scientists.  The purpose of the project is to constrain crustal thickness
              variations to the north of Iceland, along the Kolbeinsey Ridge.  Crustal
              thickness will be measured along two seismic refraction profiles - one along
              215 km of the southern Kolbeinsey Ridge from the Tjornes fracture zone
              northward to the 68 degree offset, and another cross-axis profile extending
              east from the northern end of the along-axis profile to 10 Ma-old crust.  These
              two profiles will allow the determination of the distance dependence of melt
              flux at the ridge in the critical range of 200-400 km from the plume center,
              the asymmetry of the plume influence on the spreading centers to the north and
              south, and the temporal variability of the plume influence on the ridge over
              the past 10 Ma.
