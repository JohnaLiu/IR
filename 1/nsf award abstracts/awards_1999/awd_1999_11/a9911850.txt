This three-year project proposes to provide professional
              development and leadership training for 45 teachers in the content of earth and
              environmental sciences covering the state of North Carolina.  The teachers will
              meet each summer in different parts of the state to learn directly about the
              environment in that region. These regions are the coastal region, the cental
              region and the western, mountain region.  These teachers, at the end of the
              three years, will then provide training to other teachers in their geographic
              area of the state.  Each teacher will have very substantial professional
              development, well beyond 100 hours, approaching 240 hours over the three years.
               In addition, each teacher would be given graduate credit plus other
              recertification units for successful completion of the professional
              development.  No teachers outside the state of North Carolina will be eligible
              for participation.
