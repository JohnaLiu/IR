The Education Research Collaborative at TERC in Cambridge,
              MA, is adapting and extending the materials from three NSF-funded instructional
              materials development projects in order to meet the needs of out-of-school
              youth, adult learners, and other non-traditional students enrolled in adult
              basic education, pre-GED, GED/high school equivalency, and transitional courses
              to college.  The materials being adapted are Investigations, Connected
              Mathematics, and Interactive Mathematics Program.  Eight units are being
              developed around the topic areas of:  Number Sense; Patterns, Functions, and
              Relations; Geometry and Measurement; and Probability and Statistics.  Support
              materials for instructors are being developed along with the instructional
              materials, and professional development activities are being provided as
              well.
