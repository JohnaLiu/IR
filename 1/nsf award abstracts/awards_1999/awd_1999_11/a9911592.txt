              ABSTRACT

OCE-9911592

Despite increasing recognition that iron distribution
              and availability is significant in terms of global oceanic production, the
              biogeochemistry of this trace metal remains poorly characterized.  In
              particular, it particularly desirable to develop techniques for estimating what
              portion of iron is available for utilization by the phytoplankton.  In this
              project, scientists at the Bowling Green State University will construct a
              novel, genetically-engineered cell biosensor for use in the determination of
              bioavailable iron in the waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes.  The
              Cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 will be used for the construction of
              the biosensor, and biosensor response will be evaluated in short-term
              Fe-limited growth-rate experiments, iron additions, and in studies to
              investigate the influences of temperature and light.  In the field, the
              research team will study the biosensor performance in on-deck incubations of
              water collected at discrete depth intervals as well as in in-situ deployments
              to discrete depths.  Biosensor response will be compared to other independent
              chemical measurements of bioavailable iron.  Once the technology is developed
              and perfected in the Great Lakes, it will be possible to begin development of a
              similar tool for seawater.
