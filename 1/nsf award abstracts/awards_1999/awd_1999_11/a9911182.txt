              ABSTRACT

OCE-9911182

The director of this project, together with three
              other oceanographers and meteorologists, will organize a 2.5  day workshop in
              La Jolla, California with the goal of working out a detailed implementation
              plan for the research program known as the Pacific Basin Extended Climate Study
              (PBECS).  This program will use a mix of observational, modeling and data
              assimilation to examine processes that determine the heat and fresh water
              budgets in the upper waters of the Pacific together with air-sea heat and
              moisture fluxes.  The motivation for such a study is the need to identify and
              quantify a number of processes that strongly affect the global climate, for
              example, processes that modulate the timing and amplitude of the ENSO cycle. 
              The PBECS program will form part of the U.S. Climate Variability and
              Predictability Program (CLIVAR).  Participants will include a variety of
              leading oceanographers and meteorologists currently working on climate-related
              phenomena.
