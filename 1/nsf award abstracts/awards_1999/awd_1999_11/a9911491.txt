Critical Demography is an emerging approach to the study of
              populations that introduces new theories and methods. Some are novel, others
              are borrowed from other areas in sociology. The aim in critical demography is
              to focus on ways that social structures, especially relations of power and
              domination, affect demographic phenomena such as migration and mortality. PI
              first used the term in a paper presented at the 1998 meetings of the American
              Sociological Association, in which structural constraints involving race were
              used to analyze demography of African Americans. It has since been applied to
              the study of women and of other ethic groups. This SGER will support developing
              a database at SUNY Albany that will be usable by other scholars in this
              developing approach. Data will be classified and re-coded from a large existing
              data set, the Integrated Public Use Microdata Samples (IPUMS) for the U.S.
              population from 1850 to 1900. PI will place the new database on a web site for
              scholarly public access.
