"Object Lessons:  Inquiries in Natural History for Elementary
              Schools" is a natural history-based approach to teaching science.  This
              approach introduces authentic objects and specimens into the classroom,
              providing a framework for extensive outdoor as well as indoor investigations,
              collaboration across grade levels in order to facilitate long-term
              investigations, exploring seasonal comparisons and building a data base of
              information that can support continuing schoolyard inquiries.  Real objects are
              supplemented by accurate models, scientific drawings, photographs and written
              materials for children, together with suggested lessons and background
              materials for teachers.
