Abstract    :
              This research develops a more fully verified, account of the relationship
              between gender and case-process decisionmaking, conceptualizing gender
              disparities in judicial decisionmaking as a process that takes place across
              four stages: pretrial release, adjudication, incarceration, and sentence
              length.  The research tests main, interactive, and cumulative effects of gender
              on decisionmaking across case-processing stages, contexts, and offense
              categories.  Data are disaggregated to include comparisons involving White,
              Black, and Hispanic defendants.
The main data source is the State Court
              Processing Statistics (SCPS) program, which collects individual-level
              information on the processing of a sample of felony defendants in the State
              courts of the Nation's 75 most populous counties.
