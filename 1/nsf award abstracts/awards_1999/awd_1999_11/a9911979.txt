This project will supply shipboard scientific
              support equipment for the research vessel  Blue Heron operated by the
              University of Minnesota, large Lakes Observatory and dedicated to use in
              support of ocean science research.  The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment
              Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and
              safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research
              sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data
              retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Richard D. Ricketts is fully
              qualified to direct this project having had considerable experience in
              overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.  This
              project will allow the institution to acquire DC Locker/Fire Fighting
              Equipment, Zodiac and Motor, and Shipping Container.
