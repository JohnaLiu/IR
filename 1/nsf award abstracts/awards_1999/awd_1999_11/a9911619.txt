Abstract    :
              	This project investigates the extent to which multiple understandings of
              political values present in American political culture influence the nature of
              mass public policy preferences.  The objective of the project is to test a
              general theoretical framework grounded in both psychological and political
              science literatures.  The project assesses specifically the availability of
              value meanings in American political culture, the relation of those meanings to
              individual-level characteristics and issue contexts, and their implications for
              the formation of policy preferences.  This current work expands the literature
              in the realm of political values, public opinion, and political psychology by
              conceptualizing values as multidimensional in nature, the meaning of which is
              dependent on social, psychological, and contextual factors.  The project uses
              survey and experimental methodologies in conjunction with student and community
              subject samples to examine the meanings of equality common to American citizens
              and their roles in forming the foundation for opinions regarding affirmative
              action, social welfare, and civil rights policies.  The general theoretical
              orientation of the project provides potential for the advancement of scientific
              understanding of public opinion as it seeks to attain a more nuanced assessment
              of the foundations of public policy preferences.
