Abstract    :
              	Data on the distribution of oxygen (O2) in air constrain rates of carbon
              dioxide (CO2) uptake by the global land biosphere and the ocean. They also
              allow us to calculate seasonal net production in the oceans on a hemispheric
              scale. The CO2 concentration of air is rising about half as fast as combustion
              adds CO2; the land biosphere and the oceans sequester the remainder. Since
              growth of the land biosphere produces O2, atmospheric O2/N2 data allow a
              partitioning of the sequestration between these two globally important sinks.
              
	This project supports continued measurements of the O2/N2 ratio of air
              collected at nine remote sampling sites from Barrow, Alaska, to Syowa,
              Antarctica, and on container ships transiting between Los Angeles and
              Australia. The results will improve and extend estimates of climatological
              values of CO2 sequestration rates and ocean carbon fluxes. A combination of
              empirical correlations and modeling studies will be used to examine the
              relationship between climate and the two important biospheric fluxes calculated
              from O2/N2 data: CO2 sequestration rates by the land biosphere and ocean carbon
              fluxes. The objective is to achieve process level insights into controls on
              these two fluxes by characterizing interannual variations and their causes.
