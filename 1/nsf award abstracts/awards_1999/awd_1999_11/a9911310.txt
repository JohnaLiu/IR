Abstract    :
              This project will assess the sensitivity of tropical Atlantic cross-equatorial
              heat flux to changes in trade winds that may have occurred on
              glacial/interglacial time scales.  Seasonal response of ocean flux to
              variations in tropical winds will be simulated for the warm maximum of the
              Holocene and for the last full-glacial conditions.
