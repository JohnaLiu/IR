This three-year project would provide for the
              professional development of a total of 410 teachers of physical science in the
              state of Mississippi at grades 8 and 9.  To accomplish this task a
              twelve-module instructional development manual based upon exemplary materials
              will be developed.  This manual would then be used as the basis for providing
              content and pedagogical enhancement for 130 teachers of exemplary status and
              one faculty member drawn from the two- and four-year colleges across the state.
               The first five teams would use the first three modules to the same five groups
              of 26 persons.  The next summer would be a repeat using modules 7-9 for the
              first session and 10-12 for the second so that the 130 teachers would have all
              twelve modules in hand.  The final project year would have the ten three-person
              teams at ten sites each providing the professional development to 26 new
              teachers for a total of 260 in year three.  The total number of teachers
              directly affected by the project becomes 410 high school teachers and 10
              college faculty.  Each two teams would operate in one of the five (5)
              congressional districts and be coordinated by the five Intermediate Service
              Districts of the Mississippi Department of Education.
