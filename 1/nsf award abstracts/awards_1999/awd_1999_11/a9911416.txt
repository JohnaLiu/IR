Abstract    :
              
Characterization of world river fluxes for global geochemical models is a
              major goal of geochemistry.  It is important to understand the input
              ofnutrients, trace elements, and organic carbon into the coastal ocean.  In
              addition, by studying the composition of pristine rivers, itis possible to
              understand the products of weathering, and ultimately, the long-term
              stabilization of climate by the effect of weathering on the atmospheric CO2
              concentration.  This project will extend previous work on the geochemistry of
              rivers in China to hitherto inaccessible areas of western China from which
              little data has beeen obtained.  The proposed work would involve study of the
              dissolved chemistry of these rivers as they evolve from pristine source regions
              to more heavily populated areas, collection of suspended and bed-load material,
              and establishment of a base-line against which on-going very large hydrologic
              manipulation projects can be referred.  Aspects of this work will address the
              influence of tectonics on climate via weathering and associated stabilization
              of atmospheric CO2.  This work would be done in collaboration with Chinese
              scientists.
