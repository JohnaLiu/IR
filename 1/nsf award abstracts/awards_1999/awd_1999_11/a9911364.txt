              ABSTRACT

OCE-9911364

Unusually high organic carbon concentrations are
              found in sediments accumulating under suboxic water columns where the
              oxygen-deficient zone impinges on the continental shelf.  Although several
              factors are believed to be responsible for these high concentrations and are a
              matter of ongoing debate, a mechanism to explain why a substantial fraction of
              sedimentary organic matter (OM) resists bacterial degradation only under
              suboxic water columns is still lacking.  The PIs propose to study interactions
              between iron and OM in sediments from the Mexican coast to test their premise
              that the unusually high OM concentrations in sediments result from inner-sphere
              Fe-OM complexation and "refractorization" of the more labile OM.  This
              scientific team believes that the complexation takes place because of the
              absence of significant amounts of kinetically faster competing species such as
              O2, NO3-, IO3-, Mn oxides and HS- in the sedimentary horizon where complexation
              takes place.  Results from this study will prove or disprove whether this
              iron-complexation process indeed is a viable mechanism to explain the unusually
              high OM concentrations in sediments on the Mexican coast, as well as provide
              information on the kinetics of competing reactions (ie. O2, NO3-, IO3-, Mn
              oxides and HS-) leading to the speciation of Fe in oxic, suboxic and sulfidic
              sediments.
