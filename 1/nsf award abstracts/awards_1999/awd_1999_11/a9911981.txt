The Principal Investigator will obtain
              surface velocities of outlet glaciers in eastern Greenland by using
              high-resolution (34 m pixel size) declassified intelligence satellite
              photographs (DISP) from 1963 to 1968. The velocities and visible surface
              features will provide an early baseline for detection of ice-sheet changes. For
              selected glaciers, the results will be used to describe the pattern of flow and
              to determine the dominat stress using the force-budget method where the data
              permit. The DISP images are only available on film, with each film covering a
              nominal area of 10.6 X 144.8 nautical miles. They will acquire nearly 600 films
              and assess their quality and glaciological interest, scan and digtize selected
              films. Those images that are suitable such as those with few clouds and high
              radiometric resolution will be used for automated frature tracking to obtain
              velocities. All films will be archived with a short description of each.
              Velocities obtained from the DISP will be compared with those derived from
              Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferomery. If there are large differences,
              the Principal Investigator will work with SAR scientists to identify the
              discrepancies.
