"Science Co-operatives" is a five year Local Systemic
              Change project designed to transform the elementary science program of 35 rural
              school districts in Missouri and Iowa.  The project will work directly with 75
              schools, enhance the content and pedagogical knowledge of 1,405 teachers, and
              impact over 19,000 students.  Three university-based project teams (University
              of Missouri-St. Louis, the University of Iowa, and Iowa State University),
              assisted by expert consultants and facilitated by 9 local Co-op field
              coordinators will deliver summer and school-year teacher enhancement
              activities.  Telecommunications will allow experts to deliver inservice
              instruction to teachers within and across cooperatives on a variety of science,
              pedagogical, and special topics.  The fiber optic systems involved include the
              Iowa Communication Network (ICN) and the Missouri Research and Educational
              Network (MOREnet), both fully interactive educational video networks that link
              universities, community colleges, school districts, and other sites. 
              Professional development will have, at its core, the implementation of units
              from three NSF-sponsored elementary science curriculum development projects: 
              FOSS, STC, and Insights.  Additional teacher inservice activities will be
              patterned after the highly successful "Science Parents, Activities, and
              Literature" that helped teachers  integrate their science teaching with other
              disciplines.  An independent evaluation will use both qualitative and
              quantitative methods to measure the impact of the project on students'
              opportunities to learn science, attitudes towards science and achievement, and
              teachers' knowledge of science and improved classroom practice.
