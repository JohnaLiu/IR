This project has the potential to influence early childhood
              education by creating, testing, and disseminating a science-centered preschool
              curriculum that enhances science understanding and the intellectual development
              of all children in the 3-5 age cohort, particularly girls, low income and
              minority children.  The curriculum, sufficient for one year, will consist of
              coherent and integrated, science-based, classroom activities, and related
              material for assessment and parent involvement.  Science topics provide the
              contexts for activities across the curriculum and support the development of a
              rich knowledge base and problem solving skills.  Science-based materials for
              outreach to parents will be developed utilizing "Science ZipKits" that will
              link day care/school centers and homes and continue the science explorations
              begun in the centers.  The new instructional materials will be based on current
              activities that are developmentally appropriate, engaging for all preschoolers,
              and have been shown to be effective for all children.
