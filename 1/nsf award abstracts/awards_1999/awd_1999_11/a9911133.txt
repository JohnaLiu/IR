              Abstract

The goal of this proposal is to develop nanoscale methods to
              manipulate nanoparticle chain aggregates (NCA) and measure their properties.
              These aggregates exhibit elastic properties, which have been observed for
              several metal oxides composed of particles in the 5 to 10 nm size range. 
              Measurement of the bond energies between particles and characterization of the
              elasticity are of interest, and complementary theoretical work will interpret
              the measurements in terms of fundamental properties of particle bonds. 
 A
              systematic investigation of aggregates would advance fundamental understanding
              and have broad technological implications.  The proposed research covers four
              areas.  An improved laser ablation generator for NCA synthesis will be designed
              to permit the production of more monodisperse particles.  Bond energies and
              elastic properties of the NCAs will be measured by atomic force microscopy. 
              High-speed video analysis of NCA stretching will be used to characterize
              elastic properties.  Theoretical studies will relate measured NCA properties to
              primary particle size and material properties.  Methods of relating experiment
              and theory include a statistical model of restructuring, grain boundary
              sliding, and van der Waals forces. The model has the potential for quantitative
              predictions.  This work has the potential for application to improving the
              performance of materials produced from nanoparticles including filled rubber
              and ceramics.
