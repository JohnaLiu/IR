Special Project: 
              The Story of Computer Graphics' Documentary Project


ACM/SIGGRAPH will
              produce a video documenting the history of computer graphics. The video will be
              premiered at SIGGRAPH '99 in August 1999 held in Los Angeles. The video will be
              produced in High Definition broadcast format allowing distribution in multiple
              formats such as NTSC and PAL.  The project has two volunteer Executive
              Producers: John Hart, responsible for SIGGRAPH coordination, and Carl Machover,
              responsible for content.  A distinguished content advisory committee consisting
              of Gwen Bell, Nelson Max, Chase Chasen, Dick Phillips, Alan Chesnais, Patric
              Prince, Nick England and Alvy Ray Smith helped map out content.  The treatment
              includes interviews with pioneers in the field. Footage of early
              accomplishments will be part of the video.  The video is expected to
              communicate to a wide audience the accomplishments of computer graphics ranging
              from interactive graphics systems and text formatting to movie art such as
              StarTrek.  The video will be distributed to educational circles and is expected
              to encourage young people to try science and technology career paths.
