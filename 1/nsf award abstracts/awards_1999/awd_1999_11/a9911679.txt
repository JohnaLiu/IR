CARPENTER

This professional materials development project will
              create materials to support elementary teachers in creating classroom
              opportunities that enable children to move from arithmetic thinking to
              algebraic reasoning.  Principal Investigators from the University of Wisconsin
              - Madison and the University of California, Los Angeles, will collaborate in
              the design and development of the materials.  The project builds on 12 years of
              cognitively-guided instruction professional development and research in
              addition to research on algebraic reasoning.  The current materials will be
              appropriate for elementary teachers of grades K-6.

The teacher materials
              will consist of a book and a set of video episodes on CDs that include (1) an
              analysis of the development of students' algebraic reasoning, (2) narrative and
              video cases of children solving key problems, (3) classroom interactions that
              support the development of critical constructs, (4) problems that teachers can
              pose to their students that make student's algebraic thinking explicit, and (5)
              reflection questions and writing prompts that encourage teachers to make
              explicit their own thinking about the development of algebraic thinking, their
              understanding of algebra, and the ways in which they can engage students in
              their own classrooms.  Leader resource materials will provide information to
              professional developers about paths teachers take in learning about students'
              algebraic reasoning and ways to support that development.  These materials will
              include a description and discussion of activities for (1) developing teachers'
              mathematical understanding, (2) supporting teachers in constructing problems
              and developing classroom discourse, (3) conducting inquiry about the
              development of student thinking, and (4) developing communities that support
              inquiry and teacher learning.
