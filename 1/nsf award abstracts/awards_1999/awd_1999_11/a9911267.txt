The study examines a "wave" of
              democratizations in which, according to preliminary research, the business
              community abandoned support of democracy while expressing relatively little
              concern over economic and cultural threats.  The goals of the project are 1) to
              understand why business communities abandon support of new democracies; 2) to
              test the hypothesis that this turn reflects challenges to the business
              community's control of the state, in competition with the emerging "class" of
              modern intellectuals, even where business's economic position and cultural
              values are not threatened; and 3) to investigate the last completed "wave of
              democratization" not complicated by decolonization and the Cold War, namely the
              constitutional revolutions of 1905-1912.

Qualitative comparative-historical
              research will be completed on three cases, Mexico, Portugal and Turkey using
              primary source materials in three languages.  The case studies will consist of
              a systematic examination of: 1) publications of business organizations; 2)
              memoirs of business leaders and their contemporaries; 3) contemporaneous
              periodicals; 4) the archives of government ministries monitoring
              anti-democratic activity; and 5) the observations of foreign diplomats as
              recorded in published and unpublished diplomatic documents.  Source materials
              will be analyzed for information regarding 1) the business community's support
              for democracy, with attention to possible shifts in this support over time; and
              2) the economic, cultural and political context of this support.

This
              project is limited in theoretical scope.  It is designed to study business
              community support for new democracies, but it does not address other possible
              causes of democratic survival and collapse, which are considered in the
              longer-term research agenda from which this project is drawn. This project will
              also not explore the implications of its findings for the fate of new
              democracies at the end o the 20th century.
