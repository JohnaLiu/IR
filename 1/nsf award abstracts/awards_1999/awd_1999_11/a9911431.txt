This grant is collaborative with Susan Olzak
              (SES-9911296) The research test arguments about social movements and collective
              action that address theories of political opportunity structure, tactical
              dynamics, and inter-movement competition.   A longitudinal data set generated
              from newspaper reports of protest events and covariant data sets will be
              constructed to capture relevant dimensions of the broader social, cultural and
              political context of social movements and collective action in the U.S. Phase I
              of the project (also funded by NSF) consisted of developing a reliable coding
              scheme that captures the details of protest event reports, and identifying and
              coding all protest events report in New York Times between 1960-1980.   The
              resultant database of over 10,000 protest events contains general society-wide
              indicators on three social movement areas: The Women's, Environmental and Peace
              Movements.  This initial phase of the project focused on the role of political
              opportunity in the different patterns of protest in the three movements. For
              example, preliminary analyses suggests that the timing of Women'' movement
              protest in the U.S. is strongly related to the timing of national congressional
              hearings on women's issues, consistent with a political opportunity
              interpretation.

This project, phase II, will employ the standard methodology
              developed in the initial phase to add new indicators and examine the 1950-59
              and 1981-1995 periods.  The project will explore casual mechanisms and social
              processes affecting the trajectory of public protest.  This includes its
              intensity, varying tactical dimensions, location, proximity of target and
              diffusion of its pace and tactics across time, space and social movements.  The
              longer period of data on protests will allow one to adequately analyze shifts
              in macro-level forces of change and opportunity with a variety of appropriate
              methods.
