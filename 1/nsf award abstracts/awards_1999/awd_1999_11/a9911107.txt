Science teachers in K-12 schools are for a number of reasons
              often unable to pursue scientific research interests that may have been sparked
              during their university studies.  This can be a detriment to attracting
              science-oriented students into the teaching profession.  The lack of
              opportunity to follow research also means that the science teacher is not able
              keep abreast of developments in the Earth Sciences.  This program will bring
              science teachers and research scientists together as partners to address this
              issue.  The program, Science Teacher and Research Scientist (StaRS), will
              provide the opportunity during summer break for science teachers to work in a
              research setting for six to eight weeks with AGU members and then to share
              their experiences with colleagues and students in their schools and at
              professional meetings.  This award is for a workshop to bring together selected
              teachers, scientists, teacher educators, and funders to develop an
              implementation plan.  The workshop will be held at AGU headquarters in
              Washington, D.C. to design a program with community input.  The workshop will
              include a plan of action for implementing a scientific research program for
              teachers and a report from the participants on the merits of research
              experiences for teachers and benefits for their students.
