Funds are provided for a combination
              laboratory and field study of the role of microbreaking in air-sea gas
              exchange.  Microbreaking involves the breaking of small waves without the
              entrainment of air into the water.  The resulting turbulence disrupts the thin
              skin layer near the sea surface, bringing deeper fluid in contact with the
              air-sea interface.  The gas transfer velocity has been observed to correlate
              with the fractional area of the sea surface associated with microbreaking as
              well as with the mean squared sea surface slope.  This effort is designed to
              understand the mechanisms behind the relationship between the gas transfer
              velocity and fractional area of microbreaking and to determine if the
              relationship of gas transfer velocity to mean squared slope is determined by
              microbreaking.  It is anticipated that this will allow development of a
              theoretical framework associating gas exchange and microbreaking.  Such a
              theoretical relationship would be of use in air quality prediction and global
              change and climate studies.
