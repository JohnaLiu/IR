Abstract    :
              The primary goal of the research is to predict the extent and diversity of
              near-ridge subsurface microbial habitats by constructing thermodynamic and
              kinetic models of the geochemical interactions between rocks, fluids, and
              microorganisms in the hydrothermally influenced subseafloor.  The geochemistry
              of ridge axis subseafloor environments will be modeled by calculating the full
              range of likely fluid compositions and available microbial energy.  The work
              will build on the current state of the art in reaction path and reactive
              transport models by considering interactions between fluids, rock and microbes,
              involving a suite of likely crustal compositions, phase-separated fluids,
              conductivity-cooled fluids, and mixtures of these with seawater and
              conductively-heated seawater.
