Abstract    :
              This is a geophysical investigation of the dependence of melt supply on mantle
              temperature and the effects of the variation in melt supply along the Southeast
              Indian Ridge on the crustal accretion process.  The investigation involves a
              seismic experiment including both refraction lines utilizing ocean-bottom
              hydrophones to determine variations in crustal thickness and upper mantle
              seismic velocity and multichannel seismic reflection surveys to determine the
              internal structure of the crust.  Since the spreading rate and the mantle
              source both are nearly constant along this portion of the Southeast Indian
              Ridge, the along-axis variation in depth can reasonable be ascribed primarily
              to the effects of an along-axis variation in mantle temperature.
