BSCS will form a dissemination and professional development
              center that will raise national awareness of 21 high school science curricula
              developed with NSF support, and provide professional development to teams from
              high schools and/or school districts in selecting appropriate curricula and
              implementing the adoption process.  In addition, the project will implement a
              pilot project where current earth science and physical science teachers who are
              teaching out of field can receive training in both the content and the skills
              needed for inquiry-based science instruction.  An analysis will be conducted to
              determine how the pilot model can be transferable to other sites.
