Description:  This award supports the US-India & US-Namibia
              Collaborative Research: Role of Carbonatites in the Emplacement of Fluorite
              Orebodies at Okorusu, Namibia and Amba Dongar, India.  PI Richard Hagni,
              University of Missouri Rolla, will conduct a comparative study of the world's
              two most significant carbonatite-related fluorite deposits.  
In collaboration
              with highly qualified international colleagues in Namibia and India,
this
              study will generate important data on the mineralogy, geochemistry, ore
              petrology, and petrography of these deposits.  Hagni and his students have
              already done much
preliminary work to define the important issues of research
              and comparison between these two deposits.  Numerous analytical techniques will
              be brought to bear on the samples including microthermometry of fluid
              inclusions, cathodoluminescence of carbonate minerals, trace-element analyses
              of fluorite, and ore microscopy of opaque phases.  
Scope:  The PI is an
              excellent ore microscopist and materials analyst, he has a focused sense of
              what this research will accomplish, and has excellent facilities available in
              his department.  The results will be of academic interest in the United States,
              but could be of considerable importance to Namibia and India from optimization
              of the processing technology used to recover economically important minerals. 
              The proposed research will facilitate collaborative research and direct
              exchange of scientific information between researchers from the United States,
              India, and Namibia.
