This project will create four curriculum resources that
              would be of benefit to science teachers needing orientation to technology:  (a)
              a resource guide to exemplary curriculum materials in technology education at
              the elementary and middle school grades; (b) a workshop series that uses the
              guide to introduce technology concepts to teachers and curriculum specialists
              in technology and science education; (c) a manual that will enable
              professionals to run similar workshops; and (d) a website for dissemination. 
              The resources to be selected will be consistent with standards for technology
              education, as published by the International Technology Education Association. 
              The resource guide features emerging curriculum materials from projects funded
              by the National Science Foundation.  Materials will reflect technology
              education, science curricula that emphasize technology education, and curricula
              that integrate technology and other subjects.
