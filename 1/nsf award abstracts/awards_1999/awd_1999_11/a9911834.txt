The Exploratorium's Institute for Inquiry works with teams of
              district professional developers and leaders to help them incorporate inquiry
              into their elementary science program reform plans in ways consistent with the
              vision outlined in the National Science Education Standards.  This project
              would expand and broaden that work through the research and development of five
              modules designed to enhance the capacity of professional development providers
              to introduce elementary teachers to inquiry-based approaches to science
              teaching, insure appropriate usage and explanation of science content, and
              improve the quality of professional development in elementary science
              education.  Each module will include a core set of inquiry-based activities
              that can be used by science specialists as they work with elementary teachers
              to help them improve classroom instruction.  The modules will include:  "An
              Introduction To Inquiry;" "Hands-on Curriculum Toward Enhanced Inquiry;"
              "Learning Content Through Inquiry;" "Classroom Strategies for Teaching Inquiry
              and Assessing Student Learning;" and "Designing In-depth Inquiry Experiences." 
              All modules will be made available at no cost and will be able to be accessed
              via the Exploratorium website.
