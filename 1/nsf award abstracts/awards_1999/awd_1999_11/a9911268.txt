Abstract    :
              9911268
The investigator advances the hypothesis that an important source of
              
decadal variability for the Kuroshio lies in the interaction of the
              
Kuroshio with the inertial recirculation to its immediate south.  
He argues
              that this interaction is a possible mechanism for the rapid 
transitions
              between two alternative persistent equilibria, one in which 
the Kuroshio path
              is relatively straight as it flows past Japan and one 
in which it develops a
              quasistationary southward meander.  The 
investigator proposes to test this
              hypothesis with a simplified 
numerical model of the north-west Pacific, a low
              vertical resolution 
version of MICOM.  In particular, he will examine the
              potential 
vorticity budget of the time varying Kuroshio/inertial
              recirculation 
system.  Experiments will also be made to test the influence of
              surface 
buoyancy fluxes over the recirculation gyre on the evolution of that
              gyre. 
The region of the Pacific concerned and its dynamical counterpart in
              the 
North Atlantic are the locations of some of the largest air-sea heat
              
exchanges seen outside the tropics.
