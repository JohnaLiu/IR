Abstract    :
              A relatively undistured sliver of flexured and uplifted lithosphere is exposed
              continuously for about 300 km along a seafloor spreading flow line near the
              Vema Fracture Zone in the central Atlantic Ocean.  This lithospheric sliver
              exposes a basal mantle peridotite unit, a lower crustal gabbro unit, a dike
              complex, and upper crustal asalts, and is an ideal location for studying
              temporal changes of accretion processes.  The PI has sampled the mantle-derived
              ultramafic unit at about 40 close-spaced horizontal intervals covering a
              strectch of time of over 10 my.  This project will study texture, modal
              composition and major and trace element composition of these samples.
