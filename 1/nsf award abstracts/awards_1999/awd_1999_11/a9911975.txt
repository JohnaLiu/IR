Abstract    :
              This project will examine the different magneto-hydrodynamic wave modes in the
              magnetosphere.  Four interrelated topics will be studied: (1) The relationship
              of ULF waves to the energization of particles in the radiation belts, (2)
              resonant cavity modes in the inner magnetosphere, (3) excitation of field-line
              resonance modes by energetic ring current particles, and (4) the effects of
              pressure anisotropy on the plasma dynamics of the inner magnetosphere.  The
              methods used to study these questions will include analysis of satellite and
              ground-based data, MHD and gyrokinetic simulations, and anisotropic MHD
              simulations coupled to hybrid code simulations.
