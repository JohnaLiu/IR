Abstract    :
              9911676  Strand  The objectives of this research are to improve the efficiency
              of phytoremediation of haolgenated hydrocarbons (HHCs) by studying the
              fundamental mechanism of HHC degradation in plants and, by genetic engineering,
              to provide improved strains of trees capable of more rapid ant thorough uptake
              of HHCs.  Previous work has shown that trees and other plants are capable of
              taking up and oxidizing HHCs such as trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene and
              carbon tetrachloride to chloride ion and carbon dioxide. Pilot scale trials
              have shown that full-size poplar trees growing in the field can take up large
              amounts of HHCs while producing very little air emissions.  The goal of this
              research is to gain a fundamental understanding of the transformation
              mechanisms in plants and, by using this knowledge, to increase HHC degradation
              in plants by genetic engineering.  Molecular and biochemical assays suggest
              that a plant enzyme similar to the mammalian cytochrome P450 2E1 is involved in
              HHC degradation.  This research will seek to determine the mechanism of HHC
              oxidation in plants, to isolate the genes responsible for that oxidation, to
              further analyze the improved capabilities of transgenic plants and to transform
              poplar and other tree species to optimize their HHC oxidative activities.  If
              successful, this research could lead to more cost-effective means of treating
              soils contaminated with HHCs. ***
