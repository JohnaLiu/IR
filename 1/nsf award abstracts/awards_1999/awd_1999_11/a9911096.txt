This award is proposed a workshop on RF Micromachining and
              MEMS in Wireless Communications Technology.  It will bring together
              approximately 30 researchers involved in this area of research, discuss the
              state-of-the-art of this technology, and identify the R&D needs that will help
              enable this technology and facilitate its full utilization in the development
              of the next-generation wireless systems.
