Funded under the guidelines for "Local Systemic Change through
              Teacher Enhancement," this five-year project is a partnership among Virginia
              Tech, the Albemarle County Public Schools, and the Montgomery County (Va.)
              Public Schools.  The project expands to the elementary grades the partner's
              ongoing, common work with middle and high school teachers of mathematics in the
              Local Systemic Change (LSC) project "Systemic Reform of Grades 6-12 Mathematics
              in Rural Virginia."  All 629 teachers who teach mathematics in the 27
              elementary schools in the two participating county systems receive at least 130
              hours of professional development and support for curricular implementation. 
              Albemarle County has adopted "Investigations in Number, Data and Space," and
              Montgomery County has narrowed its selection to "Investigations" or "Everyday
              Mathematics." 

The professional development consists of summer institutes
              beginning prior to implementation, and sessions that are held throughout the
              school years for the duration of the project.  The project provides 173 hours
              of professional development for the teachers at all grade levels, K-5. 
              Leadership is provided by teams, with each team consisting of a university
              faculty member, a mathematics supervisor/coordinator, one additional leader in
              each county, and six elementary teacher leaders.  A cadre of 54 teacher leaders
              -- two in each school -- contributes to the sustainability of the project
              beyond the life of its NSF funding. 

In addition to the required LSC core
              evaluation, the project's evaluation includes a component to track
              change/growth in teacher's content knowledge, as well as attitudes and beliefs
              towards mathematics. 

Auditable cost sharing is derived from Virginia Tech
              and the partnering school districts.
