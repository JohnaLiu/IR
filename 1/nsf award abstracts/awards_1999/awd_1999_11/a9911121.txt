Abstract    :
              Funds are being provided for the PIs to undertake a high-resolution study of the
              Oligocene shallow-water drill sites to determine linkages between
              oxygen-isotopic record and the sea-level variations.  Both faunal and
              stable-isotopic studies of the ODP cores and onshore sites on the New Jersey
              margin are planned.  The PIs will use the litho-and biofacies data to determine
              paleowater depth at Milankovitch scale resolution and will attempt new
              estimates of the magnitude of sea-level changes.  Onshore Oligocene daa will be
              used to reconstruct a high-resolution oxygen-isotopic record.  Detailed
              chronostratigraphy will provide a sense of leads and lags between changes in
              sea level and the sediment response.
