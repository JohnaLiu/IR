TERC and Lesley College propose a four-year, professional
              development materials project to develop and deliver an online science
              education masters degree program for teachers, curriculum specialists and
              instructional resource persons responsible for K-8 science education.  The
              program will prepare participants to integrate inquiry-based science pedagogy
              and web-based information technologies into daily practices.  The project will
              also deepen understanding of online learning models and strategies for
              professional development.

The 33-credit hour program will be comprised of
              six-credit hour modules and an introductory three-credit hour course entitled
              "Try Science."  Participants will do one module of work each college term, thus
              completing the program in two years.  Each module will have two instructors who
              together will bring science and pedagogy expertise to learners.  Participants
              will conduct real-world investigations, which will be facilitated through
              on-line instruction.  This approach will open the course to those from areas
              without convenient access to university campuses.  

With increasingly common
              technologies-Internet connectivity, a web browser and CD-ROM-learning will be
              accessible in teachers' homes or schools in asynchronous time, allowing
              teachers to better balance personal commitments and professional growth. 
              

Approximately 25 participants will move through the master's degree program
              together.  In addition, within the project time frame, it is anticipated that a
              minimum of 500 teachers will receive 90-135 hours of professional
              development.

The request is for $2,447,668.
