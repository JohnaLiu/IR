Abstract    :
              Funds are being provided for a high-resolution geomagnetic paleointensity study
              of U-channel samples from ODP Leg 129, Site 769 in the Sulu Sea.  A pilot study
              confirmed the exceptional magnetic quality of these sediments and demonstrated
              that the site is free of drilling-induced mangetic overprint or storage
              diagenesis that effects paleointensity.  Samples also preserve millennial scale
              record and have excellent stable-isotopic stratigraphy.  The study will allow a
              detailed understanding of the temporal evolution and high-rgrequency
              variability of geomagneic paleointensity record of the Brunhes age.
