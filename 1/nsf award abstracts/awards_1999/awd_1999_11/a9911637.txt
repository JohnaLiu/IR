Abstract    :
              The PI plans to attempt wireline coring on drowned reef from a leased drilling
              platform offshore British Virgin Islands. The objective is to extend the
              sea-level record from 20 k.y. back to 60 k.y. and to extend the C-14
              calibration back to 40 k.y. Stable isotopic analyses of the cores will allow
              extending the tropical sea-surface temperature record up to 60 k.y.B.P. Virgin
              Islands are situated on a stable platform and thus reconstruction of the 20-60
              k.y. record here will be more reliable for this time slice than other places
              where tectonics (uplift/subsidence) were active at that time.
