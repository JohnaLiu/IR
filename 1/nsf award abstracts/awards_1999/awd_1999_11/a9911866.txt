Abstract    :
              During the Messinian desiccation of the Mediterranean around 6 m.y. ago, exposed
              margins were severely eroded to a new base level ca. 2 km below present day sea
              level, leading to massive subaerial erosion of existing shelf platforms,
              transforming many margins into basinward dipping ramps.  During the subsequent
              flooding these were then covered by aggrading to prograding Pliocene sediments.
               The PIs will participate in a French cruise and examine the Rhone River
              margin.  This is a relatively young margin and is well preserved.  The cruise
              will acquire multi-chammel seismic data, which, along with the existing daa,
              will be interpreted to reconstruct the architecture of the evolving margin,
              from canyon cutting and incision to late rdevelopment of the sediment wedges.
