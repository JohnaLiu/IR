This 18-month project instructs teachers, primarily from
              grades 6-8, in seven selected rural school districts in Western Colorado, in
              the basic concepts of atmospheric science.  It will bring 35 teachers (five
              from each district) for a three-week summer workshop for intensive content,
              pedagogical and leadership training.  The workshop will increase the teachers'
              knowledge of the atmospheric sciences and mathematics, enable them to develop
              activity-based teaching strategies, show them how to use current educational
              technologies, increase their leadership skills and provide them with laboratory
              and field experiences as they work with UCAR scientists.  During the school
              year these teams of lead teachers will work with 21 teachers in their district
              (for a total of 182), aided by UCAR scientists, instructors from Colorado's
              Science Discovery Program and the Annenberg/CPB Internet training program.  The
              atmospheric science curriculum will be based upon the materials developed by
              the original Project  LEARN  program and includes modules entitled "Atmospheric
              Dynamics," "Ozone in Our Atmosphere" and "Cycles of the Earth and
              Atmosphere."
