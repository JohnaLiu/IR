Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to complete the analysis and synthesis of the Deep Basin
              Experiment conducted as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
              The data include current meter mooring at choke point and fracture zone,
              neutrally buoyant floats and hydrographic data with tracers and nutrients. It
              is propose to use a combination of data analysis, inverse methods, and a
              hierarchy of quasi-analytic and numerical models to produce a dynamically
              consistent understanding of the deep circulation within the Brazil Basin. Newly
              discovered features of the deep circulation will be incorporated in the
              analysis. These include a prominent zonal banding of the deep circulation, an
              apparent low frequency (order 2 year) sloshing within the basin, numerous small
              vortices embedded in the larger scale circulation, and plumes of anomalous
              water extending away from the boundary into the basin interior.
