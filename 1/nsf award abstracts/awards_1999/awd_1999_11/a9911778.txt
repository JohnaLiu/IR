In this five-year Local Systemic Change project the Hudson
              and Fitchburg Public Schools are collaborating with the University of
              Massachusetts-Lowell to implement a systemic change program for all K-5
              elementary teachers and all 6-8 middle school teachers of mathematics and
              science in the two districts.   Also providing expertise to the project will be
              the Education Development Center and TERC.  The project will build upon four
              years of standards-based mathematics and science curriculum implementation and
              teacher enhancement in each district.  Both districts have adopted and are
              committed to using only reform-based, NSF-funded curricula at both the
              elementary and middle school levels.  

The participating teachers will take
              part in 160 hours of professional development over the life of the project. 
              The majority (130) of these hours will occur at the teachers' schools, in their
              classrooms and during their contract day.  The Pedagogical Content Knowledge
              Workshops will be held in six half-day, school-time sessions per year for the
              five years.  The Workshops will broaden and deepen the teachers' content
              knowledge, while using an inquiry, reform-based instructional approach. 
              In-class support will be provided by the districts' mathematics and science
              specialists as well as a cadre of 54 specially prepared Teacher Leaders. 
              Lastly, the Summer Synergy Institute will give participants the opportunity to
              intensely examine and develop conceptual and instructional synergy between
              mathematics and science.  

The project will impact two districts, 13
              schools, 314 teachers and 6,450 K-8 students.
