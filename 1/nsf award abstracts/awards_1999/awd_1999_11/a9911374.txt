This four-year project is based on the instructional
              approach of having students discuss why incorrect thinking portrayed in "cases"
              of students' work is actually wrong.  Students examine incorrect work and
              identify what errors caused the incorrect answers.  The project will develop
              video and print materials for K-8 students, along with professional development
              materials for teachers on how to use the student materials.  At grades K-3 the
              materials will focus on beginning number and operation concepts, and at grades
              4-8 the materials will focus on rational numbers.  In total there will be 81
              full lessons, 126 mini lessons, 10 "Kids' Cases" for grades 4-8; all of these
              materials will be developed in English and Spanish.  There will also be two
              videotapes (one for primary grades and one for intermediate grades) to help
              students learn to engage in discourse.  The teacher materials will be teaching
              guides for each full lesson and mini lesson, 3 teacher's manuals (grade K,
              grades 1-3, and grades 4-8), and two additional videotapes (one for primary
              grades and one for intermediate grades) on conducting mathematical discourse. 
              Preliminary research was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the
              pedagogical approach used by the materials, and extensive piloting of the
              materials will take place in California, Arizona, Missouri and Georgia.  The
              evaluation will include analysis of students' learning of key concepts,
              teachers' use of materials, and the degree of dissemination.  The materials are
              expected to be published by Heinemann and disseminated through a national
              network and an administrators' roundtable.  The project will be conducted by
              WestEd in San Francisco.
