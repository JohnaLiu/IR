Abstract    :
              The principal investigator compiled the RIDGE Multibeam database which has put
              many girded datasets from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Mid-Ocean Ridges
              into a webing files from which digital elevation models can be created.  The
              project provides for continued maintaince and growth of this database, and for
              the development of interactive user-friendly interfaces with GMT and MSystem
              software.  The we server will supply data to users in the traditional way and
              will provide much more specialized data analysis and visualization
              capabilities.
