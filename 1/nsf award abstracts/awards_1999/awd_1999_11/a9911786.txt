              ABSTRACT

OCE-9911786


A clear understanding of microbial remineralization
              of organic matter in marine sediments is critical to our understanding of
              global O2, carbon and nutrient mass balances.  However, establishing
              remineralization rates of organic matter are difficult because steep porewater
              profiles of O2, pH, pCO2, NO3-, Mn2+, Fe2+, NH4+ and HS- are generally
              established near the sediment-seawater interface as a result of both microbial
              and chemical reactions.  These steep porewater gradients are hard to quantify
              using conventional sampling techniques that sample over cm versus mm sediment
              intervals (ie. collecting porewater via centrifugation or squeezing) and
              limitations imposed by pressure, temperature and other environmental
              conditions.  Microelectrodes have the potential to provide reliable, very fine
              scale and in-situ measurements with minimum disturbance of the system.  For
              this reason, the PI proposes to field test newly developed neutral
              carrier-based polymeric membrane pH and pCO2 microelectrodes and a profiler
              system.  The primary objective of the proposed work will be to determine the
              analytical precision and accuracy of the combined microelectrodes and profiler
              such that they can be used to study the rates and mechanisms of organic carbon
              diagenesis and CaCO3 in a variety of marine environments.
