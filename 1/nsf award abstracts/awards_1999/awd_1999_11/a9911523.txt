Abstract    :
              This project will determine the thermal budget of oceanic crustal formation
              using measurements of vertical heat flux on the Endeavour segment of the Juan
              de Fuca Ridge by systematically surveying areas of diffuse hydrothermal venting
              within the axial valley using meters.  The detailed measurements of near-bottom
              vertical heat flux will allow determination of the horizontal dimensions of the
              crustal fluid circulation cells, identification of recharge zones, and the
              partitioning of the heat of crustal formaiton between focused high-temperature
              vents, diffuse flow and conductive heat flux.
