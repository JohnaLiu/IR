Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to understand the molecular basis of solvent
              tolerance in Clostridium acetobutylicum, with the purpose of using this
              information to obtain strains that produce higher concentrations of solvents. 
              The research is organized around two hypotheses: (1) that the ability to
              produce high concentrations of solvent (butanol), and also butanol tolerance,
              is enhanced by increased protein stability in strains that overexpress
              heat-shock proteins; and (2) that butanol tolerance is enhanced by expression
              of native solvent/drug resistance genes, e. g. proteins of the multidrug efflux
              family.  This project is being jointly funded by two programs at NSF and by the
              Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
