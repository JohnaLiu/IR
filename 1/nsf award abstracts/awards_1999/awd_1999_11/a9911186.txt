Abstract    :
                  Sesquiterpenoid compounds have been identified in plant emissions in
              numerous studies and are suspected to participate in aerosol-forming processes
              and heterogeneous reactions in the atmosphere.  Understanding the role of these
              compounds in atmospheric processes is challenged by the lack of analytical
              capabilities and ambient measurements.  In this project, a capillary
              diffusion-based calibration system will be built to generate well-defined
              gas-phase concentrations of sesquiterpenoid compounds.  A gas
              chromatography/flame ionization detection instrument will provide automated and
              continuous on-line monitoring of the system output.  The calibration system
              will be designed to allow addition of potential analytical interferences to the
              analytes, such as water and ozone, in order to study the effects of these
              atmospheric components on the SQT recovery rate and the analytical precision
              and accuracy.  Sampling, storage and analysis methods using either whole air
              sampling techniques into bags and canisters and collection onto solid
              adsorption cartridges will be investigated for their analytical suitability. 
              These studies will develop methodology for the reliable measurement of
              sesquiterpenoid compounds in air for ambient measurements and flux studies.
