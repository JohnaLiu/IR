Decision Making Project Abstract:

This Small Grant
              Exploratory Research (SGER) project proposes an innovative and unconventional
              multi-sensor fusion architecture, with applications to a variety of scientific
              and engineering systems that acquire, process, and integrate information
              gathered from multiple knowledge sources and use this information for critical
              decision making. The proposed architecture leads to a critical enabler for
              autonomous operation of such systems, primarily due to its two significant
              attributes. Firstly, the fused information is richer, i.e., it  contains
              information that cannot be obtained otherwise from each individual sensor
              acting alone, and thereby enables the system to perceive or measure its
              physical environment more accurately. Secondly, the new architecture can
              efficiently fuse the information from multiple sensors in a self-organizing,
              adaptive fashion, which allows it to modify or control its own operation while
              interacting with its environment. This attribute eliminates the need for
              having, a priori, detailed and accurate information about the sensors, and of
              their physical environment. The new architecture can be gainfully employed in
              unstructured and uncertain environments. In addition to developing a sound
              mathematical theory, computer simulations and laboratory experiments are
              designed and used to validate the configuration and performance of the new
              architecture.
