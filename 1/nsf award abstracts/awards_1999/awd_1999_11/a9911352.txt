	This award provides 67 percent partial funding support for
              the acquisition of a new electron microprobe to be installed in the Department
              of Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan. The University is
              committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. The
              new microprobe will be operated as part of the University of Michigan's
              Electron Microbeam Analytical Laboratory, ensuring adequate technical support
              and access for all campus researchers. The electron microprobe is an analytical
              tool that focuses a beam of energetic electrons on a sample surface, generating
              characteristic X-rays from the elements in the sample. The technique produces
              precise chemical composition analyses of unknown samples with good spatial
              resolution in the micron range. Anticipated applications at the University of
              Michigan include research in earth sciences, science of materials, chemistry,
              engineering and dentistry.
