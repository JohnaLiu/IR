ScienceTIP is a teacher enhancement initiative for K-8
              teachers in the Sweetwater middle schools and the four feeder elementary
              districts in California.  This planning grant project will use a systemic
              approach to further define the steps required to accomplish three major goals. 
              These final goals are:  1) adopt and implement a K-8 standards-based science
              curriculum,  2) form a collaboration between teachers and administrators of the
              participating schools with science content experts in the area in order to
              provide a professional development program for standards-based instruction, and
               3) change classroom practice so that students leaving the K-8 system move
              forward prepared for high school science courses.

The planning grant will
              use the NSRC model involving school district leadership teams.  These teams
              will meet during the planning timeframe in order to address five (5) elements
              for effective science education programs.  From this planning, a long range
              strategic plan will be produced.  This final plan will be coordinated into a
              full proposal for later submission.
