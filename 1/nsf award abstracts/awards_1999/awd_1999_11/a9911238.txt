Abstract    :
              This renewal award will support further work on the geochemistry of
              redox-sensitive metals (Fe, Mn, Mo, V, U, Re and Cd) in sediments of the
              continental margins.  Data from the Amazon, Cascadia and New Guinea shelves
              will be used to calibrate a sediment model of diagenesis.  The ultimate goal is
              to predict global metal diagenesis as a function of bottom-water oxygen
              concentration and organic matter rain rate.  Such predictions will permit the
              interpretation of metal data in ancient sediments in terms of changes in water
              circulation and primary production.
