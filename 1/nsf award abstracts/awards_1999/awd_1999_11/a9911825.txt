This five-year project will provide for up to 20 teachers of
              chemistry each year to be brought into a two-year, two-month program which will
              culminate in the participants receiving a Masters of Chemical Education.  The
              participants will be chosen from the areas of  Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey
              and Pennsylvania which are in proximity to the University of Pennsylvania's
              campus.  The participants will work over three summers and two academic years
              to reach the goal of a Masters degree.  The chemistry department is working
              with the School of Education to develop and maintain the program.  The project
              will provide tuition and fee scholarships to the participants, including
              parking.  At the conclusion of this five-year program it is expected that 60
              teachers will have received their Masters degree with another two cohorts
              having nearly completed it.  The university is committed to institutionalizing
              the project, and will provide the necessary support for the last two cohorts in
              particular.
