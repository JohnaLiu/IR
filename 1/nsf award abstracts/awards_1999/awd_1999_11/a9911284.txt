Abstract    :
              This project is to merge several data bases pertaining to the federal courts of
              appeals and  the US Supreme Court. The National Science Foundation has funded
              much of this infrastructure research.   The idea that these data bases might
              some day be merged was considered when the data bases were designed and coding
              rules were coordinated to facilitate merger.  Nevertheless, the individual data
              sets have been difficult to use and investigators must devote significant time
              to learning the intricacies of each data set.  The merging supported by this
              grant will facilitate comparative analysis and widen the audience of potential
              users.  The final products will be a User's Manual, a set of commands to
              perform some functions, and a series of tables describing certain trends on the
              courts of appeals.  The material will be accessible via the internet.
