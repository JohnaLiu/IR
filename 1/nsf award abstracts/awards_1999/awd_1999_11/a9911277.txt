Investigators at Old Dominion University will develop and test
              a new system of eliminating biological fouling on sensors that measure
              temperature and salinity (thermosalinographs).  The method uses a pulsed
              electric field to eliminate biofouling, and builds upon experience on a much
              larger scale with intake pipes on power plants. Salinity is one of the
              ubiquitous measurements in ocean science research and the use of accurate
              sensors on ships and moorings with long-term measurement capabilities will grow
              in the future, as the need for real-time salinity data in oceanographic
              circulation models using active data assimilation grows. The sensor testing
              program will make use of facilities at the Virginia Marine Science Museum,
              where an educational display on salinity and its measurement will be
              established.
