Abstract    :
              Phase separation of seawater and fluid/mineral equilibration accounts for much
              of the chemical variety observed in mid-ocean ridge hot spring fluids.  Double
              diffusive convection or similar thermohaline convection processes potentially
              account for constant C1 and temperature in submarine vents, but factors
              affecting the relative transport of heat and C1 in fluids are unknown close to
              the two-phase boundary of seawater.  This project will quantify the chemical
              and thermal diffusional phoenomena and viscosity of NaC1-rich fluids at
              conditions from 350 degrees Centigrade up to and including the two phase
              boundary of seawater.
