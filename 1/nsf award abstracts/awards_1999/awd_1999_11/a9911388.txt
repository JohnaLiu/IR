Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the relationship between experiences of inequality
              and the processes/meanings underlying health assessments among African-American
              elders in Philadelphia. The study will build upon earlier work by Dressler to
              link social distress to health outcomes. The premise is that cultural models of
              health reflect the broader sociopolitical and economic realities of
              individuals' lives. It looks specifically at how African American elders define
              health and the models they use to assess their own health, and how these are
              linked to their assessment of the "health" of their communities.
