              ABSTRACT

OCE-9911913

The ocean is a major sink for CO2 produced by human
              activities, yet there are few sites where the oceanic CO2 increase is being
              measured at regular intervals over a long enough time to be detectable. 
              Quantifying the increase in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations at
              these time series sites caused by uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is complicated by
              the natural variability in the DIC budget caused by changes in physical forcing
              and biological productivity.  Measurements of 13C/12C at the Hawaii Ocean Time
              Series (HOTS) site have been shown to provide a unique fingerprint of the
              primary processes affecting DIC concentrations in the surface ocean and an
              excellent proxy for tracking the increase in DIC due to uptake of anthropogenic
              CO2.  Since 1995, the rate of increase in DICs (DIC normalized to constant
              salinity) and decrease in d13C-DIC has doubled relative to values obtained
              between 1990-1995.  The PI proposes to continue making monthly profiles of
              13C/12C and DIC at the HOTS site to determine whether the accelerated DICs
              increase and d13C-DIC decrease continues.   In addition, the proponent also
              will measure the horizontal gradients of DIC and d13C-DIC of surface waters in
              the vicinity of HOTS to determine how much of the interannual increase in
              surface DICs at HOTS can be explained by changes in the advection of water
              masses and rates of biological carbon export versus uptake of anthropogenic
              CO2.
