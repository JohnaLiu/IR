Abstract    :
              		The vertical transport of momentum by cumulus convection is very important in
              maintaining the large-scale atmospheric circulation, but the process is not
              adequately represented in general circulation models of the atmosphere.  The
              development of parameterizations of convective momentum transport is extremely
              important to the advancement of climate and numerical weather prediction in
              general.  
	Dr. Zhang will investigate fundamental issues related to
              convective momentum transport and the development of a convective momentum
              parameterization scheme.  Specifically he will examine the role of the
              convection-induced pressure gradient force across clouds in vertical momentum
              transport.  He will employ two- and three-dimensional cloud resolving models
              and a single column model as well as observations from both a tropical maritime
              environment and a midlatitude continental environment.  The cloud resolving
              model results will be used to understand the role of the pressure gradient
              forces and then refine the parameterization.  Several parameterizations will
              then be tested through simulations with a single column model.  Ultimately the
              results should improve our understanding of the effect of convective momentum
              transport on the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere.
