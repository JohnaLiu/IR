Abstract    :
              This project develops and conducts a theoretical and experimental program to
              extend existing theories of status generalization to include effects of "second
              order expectations," imputations of one's ability received from one's partner
              in a task-focused group.  Two sequential experiments, both of them variations
              of a standard laboratory situation, will be conducted.  The first will assess
              our theoretical statement and will compare it to alternatives.  The second will
              refine the theory's mechanisms for representing second order information.  The
              results should show an effect of the partner's opinion on one's own beliefs and
              behaviors.

The general result of this work will be an extension of status
              characteristics theory to incorporate a new class of types of situations and
              behaviors, those involving information from the partner about oneself. 
              Understanding the import of other's views of our abilities will lead to a
              better comprehension of the process underlying cooperative task groups.  This
              research tradition, status characteristics theory, will also be related to a
              set of other social science traditions.
