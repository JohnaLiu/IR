Abstract
OPP-9911278
This proposed research seeks to predict the impact of
              perturbations such as climate change, atmospheric deposition of nutrients, and
              increasing use of natural resources, on the Arctic north-slope tundra.  Through
              a variety of research grants, including Long Term Ecological Research projects,
              the Toolik Lake Research Site has a 25-year research record on lake, stream,
              and terrestrial ecology.  This proposal would seek an additional 5 years of
              support to develop linked models of soil, stream, and lake processes affecting
              the flow of carbon and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).  Detailed
              experiments would be conducted to evaluate specific interactions.  Additional
              work would develop (1) linked numerical component models for fluxes of water,
              nutrients and organic matter through small catchments and compare these models
              with new experimental results, (2) develop an ecological classification for the
              streams and lakes within the larger basin containing Toolik Lake, (3) produce
              information by remote sensing and GIS (geographic information system) on the
              surrounding environment and also on the location of stream and lake classes and
              likely structure of food webs, and (4) calibrate the component models. 
              Educational and outreach experiences have been included.
