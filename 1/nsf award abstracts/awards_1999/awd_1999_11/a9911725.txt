Abstract    :
              Funds are being provided to allow the PIs to continue the interpretation of the
              seismic reflection and refraction data gathered during a 1997 cruise to the
              Galicia Bank and the Iberian Abyssal Plain.  Some 4000 km of high-quality
              reflection profiles with 56 deployed OBS and hydrophones were collected on
              which the basic processing has been completed.  In addition to this data, the
              British and French data in teh region will also form a part of the synthesis. 
              The PIs will pursue pre-stack depth migration to image the internal structure
              of the peridorite ridge formed by the uplift of the upper mantle.  Extimation
              of lateral variability of crustal extension on Iberian margin, calculation of
              residual Buguer gravity anomaly and a comparison with the conjugate New
              foundland margin are also planned.
