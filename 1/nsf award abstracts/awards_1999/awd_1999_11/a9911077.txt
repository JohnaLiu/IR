CISE Research Instrumentation: Dual
              Manipulator Mobile Robot

The Department of Electrical and Computer
              Engineering at Michigan State University will purchase a dual-arm mobile robot
              system consisting of a mobile platform equipped with a dual-arm manipulator and
              various sensors.  This equipment will be dedicated to support research in the
              area of computer and information science and engineering.  The equipment will
              be used for several research projects including in particular: Planning and
              Control for Cooperative Operation of Multiple Mobile Manipulator in a
              Perceptive Frame; Task Scheduling and Control of a Reconfigurable Manufacturing
              Workcell; Heterogeneous Function-Based Human/Robot Cooperation; Multi-Sensor
              Fusion in Robot Action planning and Control.  The objectives of these projects
              aim at developing theoretical foundations for intelligent planning and control
              of robotic and manufacturing systems to improve the reliability and efficiency
              of operations.  The requested equipment will provide unique capability to
              experimentally implement and test new theoretical findings.
