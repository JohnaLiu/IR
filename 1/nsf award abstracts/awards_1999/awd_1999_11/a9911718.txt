Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to establish a functional proteomics approach
              for the elucidation of the important aromatic biosynthesis pathways of the
              extremely thermoplilic sulfate-reducing archaeon, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, whose
              genome was recently sequenced.  In particular, the Principal Investigators
              
will design techniques based on the coordinated use of liquid
              chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), DNA microarray technologies, and gene
              cloning and expression in E. coli for efficient screening of enzyme activities
              and for gene identification.
