Abstract    :
              The Cox, Matthews and Associates (CMA) will convene a conference titled:
              National Conference on Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education for
              African American Students.  This national conference will focus on techniques
              and strategies available to provide underserved, underrepresented target
              population of African American youth with skills needed to complete in an
              increasingly technologically oriented workplace.

The objective of this
              conference is to explore plans for implementing successful strategies that have
              been researched and proven successful with African American students in
              communities, K-12 schools, colleges, and universities.  Also, the conference
              will highlight the plausibility of replicating these successful practices for
              teaching science, mathematics, and technology education in urban schools where
              African Americans are the underserved, underrepresented population.
