This project studies how changes
              in state law affect non-governmental associations from about 1900 to 1940. The
              issue is important because many analysts have studied such associations as
              vehicles to promote or retard democratization, and to promote or retard welfare
              and other types of social change. The legal climate in which potential
              associations exist affects their structure and mission, as well as composition
              of their membership. Identifying the legal structure and relating it to the
              types of organizations is the first step in the research. Following that, the
              PI will seek to explain variations that exist among organizational types in the
              same environments, and how the organizations seek to conform to their legal
              climates. 

The investigation is made possible by the considerable variation
              among states in laws governing associations during the period to be examined.
              An early part of the research will document and seek to explain variations in
              laws governing formal associations. Next, the research will investigate links
              between specific laws and the form and purpose of associations, tracing how
              they encourage some combinations of organizational forms while proscribing
              others.  The scope is ambitious and the work will contribute to several areas
              of sociological research such as development of the welfare state and the
              relationships of political action and market forces. 

The main value of this
              work is historical and theoretical. Empirically, its main contribution will be
              to develop ways to measure political-legal structures governing the existence
              and activities of associations.
