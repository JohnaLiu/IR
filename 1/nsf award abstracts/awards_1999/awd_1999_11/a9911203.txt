Abstract    :
              SES 99-11203 - Anne C. Fitzpatrick (George Washington University) 
"War by
              Numbers:  Computers, Nuclear Weapons, and the Arms Race"

This project
              embodies a comparative history of computing in the American and former Soviet
              nuclear weapons programs. This award supports travel to and research at several
              scientific institutions and archives through-out North America, Russia,
              Ukraine, and Armenia, as well as interviews with numerous participants in the
              nuclear weap-ons communities. This research will provide the scholarly basis
              for a book that will be published by a university press. This study will
              greatly enhance public understanding of the role of technology in the nuclear
              arms race, and in science and society.
