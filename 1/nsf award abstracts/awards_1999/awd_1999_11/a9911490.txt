Abstract    :
              This project consists of a methodological and an auction-theoretic section. The
              former extends
the literature on the foundational theory of extensive games by
              introducing the notion of
epistemic priorities and analyzing its implications.
              The latter applies the foundational approach
to game theory to the study of
              standard and novel auction mechanisms; hence, it helps clarify the
connections
              between the predictions of auction theory, and its underlying behavioral
              and
epistemic assumptions.

The notion of epistemic priority reflects the
              idea that players may entertain various hypotheses
about their opponents, and
              rank them according to their plausibility. Epistemically
              prioritized
hypotheses form the basis for an axiomatization of solution
              concepts incorporating forward
induction, but are also useful in understanding
              the role of belief consistency in equilibrium
analysis.

The analysis of
              auctions employs normal- and extensive-form rationalizability, augmented
              with
appropriate assumptions on bidders' mutual beliefs. This project develops
              general techniques to
solve a variety of "standard" auction mechanism under
              different assumptions about payoffs and
information. This methodology is then
              employed to assess the robustness of "classical" results in
auction theory,
              such as revenue equivalence / revenue ranking of different auction formats,
              bid
shading in first-price auctions, and demand reduction in uniform-price
              auctions.
