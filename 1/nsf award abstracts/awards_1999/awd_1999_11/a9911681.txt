Abstract    :
              Researchers will examine the role of climate factors on the carbon and nutrient
              uptake by tundra root systems in the Arctic. Isotopic tracers will be added to
              existing long-term plots to examine the flow of carbon through root systems and
              into the soil through several growing seasons.  The production of roots and the
              fate of root-derived inputs to soils is not understood sufficiently well in the
              Arctic to enable predictions of the effects of global warming on the
              uptake/release of greenhouse gases.  This project will determine C-N
              interactions as a function of climate, assess the effects of climate change,
              examine the controls on the fate of  root carbon, and develop a model to
              predict carbon distribution and export in Arctic tundra ecosystems.  The
              results from this project will be incorporated in regional scale models that
              are used to predict ecosystem and landscape responses to climate change.
