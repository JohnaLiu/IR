Abstract    :
              The goals of this research are to study the de novo synthesis and metastability
              of organic acids that are potential energy sources for microorganisms
              inhabiting hydrothermal vent environments.  The work will test the hypothesis
              that short-chain carboxylic acids can form matastaly by mineral catalysis under
              hydrothermal conditions, and that they can persist under these conditions to
              serve as potential energy sources for thermophilic and hyperthermophilic
              prokaryotes.  Computer modelling will be used to predict thermodynamic
              conditions that favor the metastable formation of organic acids when
              hydrothermal fluid and seawater mix.  The modelled fluid composition,
              temperature ranges, and pressure will then be simulated in a flow-through
              catalytic reactor vessel to empirically test thermodynamic predictions and to
              determine kinetic mechanisms and reaction rates.
