The Role of Memory Retrieval in Probability
              Judgment
 
People are often overconfident about their answers to general
              knowledge
questions (e.g. whether chimpanzees have longer or shorter
              gestation
periods than humans).  And there is ample evidence that "real
              world"
judgments, such as physicians' diagnoses of myocardial infarction,
              are
often less than ideal in a similar way.  The proposed research is
              intended
to further develop and test a recently proposed model which asserts
              that
features of how people bring to mind ("recruit") arguments pertinent to
              a
given judgment situation lead to deficient judgment.  This research
              is
further anticipated to illuminate procedures that yield
              improved
judgments.  The "argument recruitment model" proposes that people
              rarely
base their judgments on more than a few facts or arguments.  And when
              they
do bring to mind multiple arguments from memory, the ones retrieved
              later
in the process tend only to support those presented earlier.  The
              model
predicts that judgment should be improved if the amounts and "balance"
              of
retrieval of facts from memory are changed.  Thus, the
              primary
manipulation to be explored in this research is that of requesting
              study
participants to recall all of the relevant facts (e.g., similar
              previous
cases) they can prior to rendering their judgments.  Support for the
              model
will be indicated to the extent that such demands tend to reduce
              the
overconfidence evident in participants' judgments.
