Abstract    :
              This award is for a reconnaissance investigation of lakes in the Lofoten
              archipelago, off the coast of northern Norway, to identify lakes with potential
              for high resolution paleoclimate studies, by carrying out limnological and
              bathymetric surveys and recovering and analyzing short cores of lacustrine
              sediments from selected sites.  The Lofotens (67-69 degrees N in the North
              Atlantic) are in a location that is sensitive to changes in ocean circulation
              within the Norwegian Sea, and they are strongly influenced by variations in
              atmospheric circulation through the North Atlantic Oscillation.  If the proper
              lake sediments can be found, high-resolution sedimentary records of changes in
              these ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns would be valuable.
