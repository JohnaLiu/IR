Abstract    :
              This research project involves field and laboratory studies on the physiological
              and behavioral adaptations of birds to the extreme conditions that prevail in
              Arctic environments.  The study will focus on four bird species found at sites
              in Greenland and Alaska that represent a series of harsh polar conditions.  The
              effect of different environments on breeding will be determined in order to
              examine the role of climate.  Blood samples and steroid treatment will be used
              to test hypotheses about the role of environmental conditions on testosterone
              production and its effect on reproductive behavior during the breeding season. 
              The results will be used to examine the potential effects of changing climate
              conditions, such as global warming, on the breeding behavior of birds that
              migrate into the Arctic.
