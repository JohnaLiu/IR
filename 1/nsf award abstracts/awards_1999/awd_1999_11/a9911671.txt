This project will produce an integrated, video-based
              instructional resource on the current DNA-based revolution in biotechnology,
              covering the related science history, basic science concepts, current
              technology and surrounding social issues.  It is directed at students and
              teachers of biology in grades 8-12.  In addition to a 5-part series of 20- to
              30-minute instructional videos, there will be a comprehensive teacher's
              guidebook and a web site to provide additional background information,
              classroom learning activities and independent research projects.  Basic
              knowledge of genetics, particularly molecular genetics, is becoming more and
              more important for every person in our nation.  Recent advances in food
              production and medicine in particular mandate that all people have a solid
              understanding of fundamental genetic principles.  However, the content is new
              and complex.  This project will introduce difficult concepts in genetics with
              an engaging format designed to appeal to the student audience through the
              creative use of music, animation and humor.  It will easily integrate into
              existing biology curricula, and will serve as a launching point for
              inquiry-based investigations.  There is a well-conceived dissemination plan,
              which includes public broadcasts on Public Broadcasting Stations in the US and
              Canada, with subsequent sales.
