MAPPING BRAIN
              FUNCTION BY COMBINED MRI, MEG and fMRI

The overall goal of this project is
              to develop composite techniques for noninvasive, functional brain imaging that
              provide spatial and temporal resolution superior to any available imaging
              techniques. One objective is to develop a probalistic framework of
              computational methods for the integrated analysis of multi-modality image data.
              A second objective is to develop and evaluate advanced forward models for
              MEG/EEG. A third objective is to enhance experimental and analytical methods
              for functional neuroimaging (event related fMRI). A fourth objective is to
              collect physiological data inside the MRI magnet by developing
              electrophysiological and optical systems with that capability. A fifth
              objective is to develop and apply computational tools for mapping brain
              function.
