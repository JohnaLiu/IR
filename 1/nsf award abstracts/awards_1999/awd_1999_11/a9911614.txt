This two-year, multidisciplinary science program based on the
              college text, "The Sciences:  An Integrated Approach," by James Trefil and
              Robert Hazen provides an alternative to the traditional sequence of science
              courses in the ninth and tenth grades.  The materials are developed by first
              choosing the learning goals, then providing assessments to determine that the
              learning goals are achieved.  For the ninth grade, rigorous science is learned
              through the use of cross-cutting themes with different integrating vehicles: 
              energy through personal and social perspectives, the material world through
              science and technology, cycles through history and nature of science, and
              evolution through science as a human endeavor.  In the tenth grade, modules
              concentrate on experiences from each discipline with connections to the others.
               After this course, students should be able to continue taking other
              disciplinary or multidisciplinary standard or honors courses.  In addition to
              the student materials, there is a teachers' guide providing content and
              strategies for teaching the activities and two implementation guides addressing
              awareness and planning for change and ongoing implementation needs of the
              teachers of integrated science.  A professional development program is also
              developed.  Field testing is in eight sites nationally.
