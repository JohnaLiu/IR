              ABSTRACT

OCE-9911707

The development of an accurate understanding of
              global biogenic fluxes will require the synthesis of satellite, process,
              time-series and seafloor studies, each providing unique information.  Satellite
              observations provide global, synoptic images of surface pigment distributions,
              but by themselves do not constrain fluxes from the photic zone to the deep
              ocean.  Process and time-series studies provide detailed information about the
              production, transformation and fluxes of biogenic materials, but at a very
              limited number of specific locations.  Seafloor studies, while not constraining
              short-term temporal variability, provide an assessment of the global
              distribution of the deep oceanic fluxes.  For this reason, the PI proposes to
              develop a basin-wide, quantitative description of carbon fluxes based on a
              general diagenetic model into which global seafloor measurements of organic
              carbon, calcium carbonate, opal and benthic oxygen are assimilated.  In
              addition, the PI also will compile nutrient and selected metal fluxes (Ba and
              Ge) into the same data set so that flux patterns of these components can be
              compared to carbon fluxes. It is expected that results from this study will
              yield an organic carbon-calcium carbonate-opal model by which the impact of
              calcium carbonate and opal accumulations on the organic carbon accumulation can
              be represented, as well as the permit other environmental factors to be
              considered in developing an improved description of seafloor biogenic fluxes.
