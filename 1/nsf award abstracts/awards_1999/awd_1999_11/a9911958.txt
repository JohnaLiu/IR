This proposal supports U.S.-Japan collaborative research
              between Dr. Bruce Baldwin of the Department of Chemistry, Spring Arbor College,
              Spring Arbor, MI and Dr. Takuji Hirose, Department of Applied Chemistry,
              Faculty of Engineering, Saitama University, Saitama, Japan.  Dr. Baldwin will
              be supported for three months at Saitama University in order to develop new
              chemical sensors or recognition agents for chiral molecules.  These new agents
              would be the natural extension of work previously completed in Japan by the
              host scientist, Dr. Takuji Hirose, and the PI.

Conventional and enzymatic
              methods will be used to make the target molecules stereoselectively.  The
              conventional approach will produce a racemic mixture of the target chiral
              molecules, separated by chiral column technology or as distereomeric salts. 
              The enzymatic method capitalizes on the American PI's experience with
              enzymatically promoted organic chemistry, making an artificial enzyme using a
              natural enzyme.

Molecular engineering of chemical recognition moieties is
              crucial for developing new materials having unique properties, molecular
              devices such as sensors, and stereocontrolled synthesis and separation systems.
               Chemists and industries in both the United States and Japan are intensely
              interested in these systems, so these studies will benefit the chemical
              knowledge of mutual importance to both countries.  It is expected that the
              cooperation between these laboratories should foster future collaborations and
              promote international exchange of scientific resources and ideas.
