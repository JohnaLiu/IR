This grant is collaborative with John McCarthy
              (SES-9911431). The research test arguments about social movements and
              collective action that address theories of political opportunity structure,
              tactical dynamics, and inter-movement competition.   A longitudinal data set
              generated from newspaper reports of protest events and covariant data sets will
              be constructed to capture relevant dimensions of the broader social, cultural
              and political context of social movements and collective action in the U.S.
              Phase I of the project (also funded by NSF) consisted of developing a reliable
              coding scheme that captures the details of protest event reports, and
              identifying and coding all protest events report in New York Times between
              1960-1980.   The resultant database of over 10,000 protest events contains
              general society-wide indicators on three social movement areas: The Women's,
              Environmental and Peace Movements.  This initial phase of the project focused
              on the role of political opportunity in the different patterns of protest in
              the three movements. For example, preliminary analyses suggests that the timing
              of Women'' movement protest in the U.S. is strongly related to the timing of
              national congressional hearings on women's issues, consistent with a political
              opportunity interpretation.

This project, phase II, will employ the standard
              methodology developed in the initial phase to add new indicators and examine
              the 1950-59 and 1981-1995 periods.  The project will explore casual mechanisms
              and social processes affecting the trajectory of public protest.  This includes
              its intensity, varying tactical dimensions, location, proximity of target and
              diffusion of its pace and tactics across time, space and social movements.  The
              longer period of data on protests will allow one to adequately analyze shifts
              in macro-level forces of change and opportunity with a variety of appropriate
              methods.
