This proposal, sponsored by Rutgers University, will carry
              out a three-year project which will involve 30 High School teachers each year
              of the project who will commit to a six-week, two-summer research experience --
              four weeks in the first summer  and two weeks in the second summer.  The
              research is in the area of discrete mathematics -- especially graph theory --
              with an emphasis on applications.  The first summer includes an educational
              program centered on content, mentored research work, teacher-researcher
              interaction, and classroom implementation sessions.  Follow-up will occur
              during the academic year and includes research activities for students.  The
              school program will culminate with presentations about the research projects in
              a spring conference.  In the following summer the teachers will be involved in
              a more sophisticated series of research projects.  Also teachers will report on
              the implementation in the classroom of the materials which were based upon the
              research topics.  The second year teachers will act as mentors with the next
              cohort of teachers to help their transition to research and classroom
              implementation.
