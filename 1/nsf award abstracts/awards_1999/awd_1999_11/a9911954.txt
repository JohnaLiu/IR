              ABSTRACT

A study of equilibrium
              an dynamic effects in systems containing liquid triglycerides is proposed to
              provide fundamental understanding relevant to emulsions, microemulsions, and
              especially foams containing these
Renewable oils.  Phase behavior studies
              would include use of surfactants such as those with propylene oxide chains,
              which show promise of solubilizing long-chain liquid triglycerides and forming
              microemulsions.

A major emphasis of the proposed research is study of the
              effect of triglycerides on foam stability.  Because these effects are important
              both in dishwashing, where stability is desirable, and in the operation of
              horizontal-axis washing machines, where it is undesirable, the proposed work
              would be conducted in collaboration with Shell Chemical Company as a GOALI
              project.  It includes both a systematic study designed to identify surfactant
              structures producing forms most or least sensitive to destabilization by
              triglycerides and direct observations with the Particle Vision Measurement
              apparatus and with videomicroscopy to obtain an improved fundamental
              understanding of the mechanism by which liquid and solid triglycerides
              destabilize foam.
