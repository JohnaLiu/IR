Abstract    :
              This study will examine the population dynamics of two dominant grazing copepod
              species, Calanoides carinatus and Eucalanus crassus, in the context of a
              coupled biological?physical model in the northwestern Indian Ocean. The model
              populations will include a diapausing fifth copepodite stage (CV) believed to
              have evolved as the result of a predictably intermittent food supply associated
              with upwelling caused by seasonal monsoonal forcing within the region. The
              primary objectives of this study are: 1) to determine the significance of
              ontogenetic migration and diapause of the copepods Calanoides carinatus and
              Eucalanus crassus for the success of these populations in the northwestern and
              equatorial Indian Ocean, with respect to timing of migration and onset and
              collapse of phytoplankton blooms associated with monsoonal upwelling; 2) to
              test hypotheses of mechanisms underlying the initiation and cessation of
              diapause in CV stage of C. carinatus and E. crassus; and 3) to ascertain the
              importance of physical advection in transporting populations to the Oman coast,
              Gulf of Aden and Gulf of Oman, and potentially more distant areas such as
              Mozambique and Java, using the Great Whirl off Somalia as the epicenter of
              distribution of C. carinatus and E. crassus.
