Abstract    :
              The NAE Committee on Engineering Education (CEE) was established in August 1999
              within the NAE's Independent Program Office.  The mission of this new committee
              is to strengthen the National Academies' (NAE,NAS,IOM, and NRC) collective
              voice and service to the nation on issues pertaining to the vitality and
              currency of engineering education in the United States. As a standing
              committee, the CEE consolidates the membership, functions, and ongoing
              activities of both the former NRC Board on Engineering Education (BEEd) and the
              former NAE Academic Advisory Board (AAB), thus bringing the Academies' efforts
              in the area of engineering education into close affiliation with the Office of
              the NAE President.

The National Science Foundation will support the planned
              core activities of the CEE for the period October 1, 1999, to September 30,
              2004.  

The general objectives of the CEE's proposed effort are
              to:

Identify significant issues in engineering education and collect the
              information necessary for their detailed examination;

Develop long-term
              strategies for engineering education in the context of changing national and
              global circumstances, technologies, and societal and industrial
              needs;

Recommend specific policies to implement these strategies to
              appropriate national and state government agencies, and university
              administrations;

Organize studies on future possibilities in technologies
              and industrial practices and serve as a bellwether for the improvement of
              engineering curricula and institutions;

Engage in public education and
              outreach on issues relevant to its mission; and

Provide for ongoing
              assessment of the impact of CEE activities on the currency of engineering
              education in the United States.
