Abstract    :
              Award is for Os isotopic analysis of Quaternary to Recent alkaline asalt samples
              from Vesteris Seamount, a 3000m high, solitary volcano offshore of northeastern
              Greenland in the North Atlantic Ocean.  These samples (together with other
              alkaline asalt samples from the North Atlantic), which include
              well-characterized basanites of up to 14% MgO, have been shown to contain
              measrable 187 Os/188 Os, rare amongst oceanic lavas which are not directly
              related to mantle plumes.  This study will study small-scale heterogeneities in
              the oceanic upper mantle, and would enhance our understanding of the Os
              composition of the depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle source.
