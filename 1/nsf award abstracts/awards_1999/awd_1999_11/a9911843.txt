This national project provides training and support in
              computational science for 200 high school teachers from 50 schools. 
              Participating teachers receive 180 hours of instruction and up to 18 CEUs as
              part of this leadership program.  The first cadre begins with the SC2000
              national high performance computing, and networking conference and the second
              cadre with the SC2001.  Each is followed by support and in-service training
              events during the school year from a national support structure consisting of
              the proposing institutions.  Included are Summer Institutes for each to refine
              and extend the computational science skills of the teacher participants.  The
              purpose of this project is to investigate how computational science can best be
              presented and integrated into the high school curriculum in a variety of school
              districts and how computational science affects student learning of topics in
              mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, environmental science and
              physics.

This project builds on previous work and leverages the efforts of
              the proposing institution and its partners, who have extensive investments in
              computational science.  The partners include the Krell Institute, the National
              Center for Atmospheric Research, the National Center for Supercomputing
              Applications, the Ohio Supercomputer Center, the Shodor Education Foundation,
              and the University of Alabama, as well as the sponsoring professional societies
              of the SC conferences, the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE
              Computer Society.
