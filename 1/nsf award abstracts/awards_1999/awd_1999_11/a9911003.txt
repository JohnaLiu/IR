Abstract    :
              TELL  (Turkish Electronic Living Lexicon) is a searchable online
              electronic
database containing a list, derived primarily from dictionaries
              and
atlases, of those Turkish words known to a one native speaker of
              Standard
Istanbul Turkish. Words are entered both in orthography and in
              standard
phonemic transcription, as elicited from the speaker. Each lexeme
              was
elicited in several morphological contexts; these are all included in
              TELL.
Etymological information and roots of complex words are provided for
              just
over half of the items. The preceding was accomplished during the
              first
phase of TELL, funded by NSF. The second phase will add
              significant
dimensions to the database. Two additional speakers will be
              added;
etymological sourcing and morphological parsing will be completed.
              TELL
will be linked to a sizable text corpus so that text frequency
              and
concordance information can be provided for each lexeme. For two of
              the
speakers, high-quality audio files will be made available for each
              word,
downloadable over the internet. TELL will thus be a tool for
              phonologists
and phoneticians alike, and will also serve teachers and students
              of
Turkish. The URL for TELL
              is
