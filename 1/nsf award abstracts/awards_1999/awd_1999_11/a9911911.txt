This U.S.-Mexico award will help to support doctoral
              dissertation work of Eric Keys in the southern Yucatan under the supervision of
              Prof. Billie Turner of Clark University.  The research will study the expansion
              of commodity chile peppers production in the southern Yucatan peninsular region
              of Mexico and the idea that this activity increases small-holder welfare while
              reducing deforestation within a tropical forest and surrounding biosphere
              reserve.  The study will focus on three elements: the environmental limits on
              chile peppers cultivation, the economic rewards of chile marketing, and how
              chile cultivation links to critical agents in development and conservation.
              

The desire to preserve tropical environments and the realization that
              individuals depend on those environments for livelihood, leads to attempts to
              link conservation with development. Intensive agriculture is frequently
              proposed as a strategy that enables farmers to increase their economic welfare
              and, at the same time, limit the total amount of land cultivated and thus helps
              to save ecosystems high in biodiversity, carbon-storage potential, or
              archeological and historical remains.  Using diverse methods such as
              ethnography, surveys, ecological research, and remote sensing, and in
              collaboration with researchers at the El Colegio de la Frontera Sur-ECOSUR, a
              Mexican research institute for southern border environmental research, this
              study will increase our understanding of conservation and development
              strategies.
