Funds are provided for both analytical and
              numerical modeling of the influence of Agulhas eddies on the Brazil-Malvinas
              Confluence Zone.  In particular, the influence of ring absorption on the
              temporal variability of the Brazil Current strength will be modeled. 
              Variability of the strength of this current influences the migration of the
              Brazil-Malvinas Confluence Zone. Different hypotheses concerning the formation
              and detachment of intrusion eddies will also be tested. The modeling studies
              will begin with a simple reduced gravity, one and a half layer analytical model
              and a one and a half numerical isopycnic before moving on to more realistic two
              layer models.
