              Instrumentation: Advanced Human Computer Interfaces for Biomedicine

The
              Department of Computer Engineering and Computer Science at the University of
              Missouri-Columbia will purchase audio, video, and virtual reality (VR)
              equipment which will be dedicated to support research in computer and
              information science and engineering.  The equipment will be used for several
              research projects.

1.  Spoken Language Processing for Telemedicine and
              Collaborative VR Environments
      Voice-driven automatic captioning in
              telemedicine for people with hearing disabilities
      Speech separation and
              recognition for collaborative VR environments
  
2. Video Communications over
              Telemedicine Networks and Geometric Coding of Anatomical Data
     Lips and
              hands focused real-time video coding for lipreading and hand-signing in
              telemedicine
     Three-dimensional geometric coding for collaborative
              VR-based endoscopic simulator

3. Collaborative Virtual Endoscopy and Digital
              Human Atlas with Speech Interface
     Prototype Intelligent Endoscopic
              Simulator (IES) for examining internal tissues and organs 
     Virtual
              operating table interface for teaching and examining complex multisource
              anatomical data
