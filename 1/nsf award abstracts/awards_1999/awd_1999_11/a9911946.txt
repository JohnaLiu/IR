Kangari

This proposal supports U.S.-Japan collaborative research
              between Dr. Roozbeh Kangari of the Construction Research Center, Georgia
              Institute of Technology, Atlanta and Dr. Toshiaki Fujimori, Director of the
              Advanced Technology Development Division at Shimizu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan. 
              Dr. Kangari will be supported for three months at Shimizu Corporation in order
              to collect information and data, study and analyze system productivity and
              logistics of Shimizu Manufacturing system by Advanced Robotics Technology
              (SMART) system.

The SMART system which will be investigated by the PI, is a
              part of an overall CIC (Computer Integrated Construction) strategy by Japanese
              firms for developing construction systems.  The proposed collaborative research
              in Japan will be focused on the following areas:  (1) to investigate the
              productivity improvement (cycle time analysis) of the three generation of the
              SMART project, (2) to study the safety improvement of the work environment in
              the SMART project; (3) socio-economic issues of robotization due to current
              reduction in R&D budget and Japan's slow economic recovery.

It is expected
              that the collaboration could lead to a set of new findings and recommendation,
              which might assist the industry.  The proposal also requests a supplement of
              travel expenses for a graduate student to participate in the research
              collaboration in Japan.  It is expected that the cooperation between these
              institutions should foster future collaborations and promote international
              exchange of scientific resources and ideas.
