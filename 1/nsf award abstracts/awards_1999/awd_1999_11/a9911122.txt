Abstract    :
              Tundra on the north slope of Alaska is covered with a large number of thaw-basin
              lakes which are the primary site of carbon storage via peat formation.  This
              three-year collaborative study will evaluate the overall coverage by lakes of
              the tundra near Barrow and Atqasuk (Alaska) based on high resolution satellite
              data.  Detailed on-site examination of thirty lakes will be done using ground
              penetrating radar to determine the thickness and distribution of peat and soil
              under the lakes.  Sediment cores will be collected to check the validity of the
              radar data.  Also, detailed examination of strata within the cores will be made
              based on soil composition, microfossil identification, pollen analysis and
              other measures.  In 4 detailed cores, the ages of the various strata will be
              determined by radiocarbon dating.  These results will allow the investigators
              to assess the carbon storage and peat formation history in the thirty lakes. 
              The regional history of peat accumulation may be estimated when the individual
              lakes are put in context of the regional lake distribution assessed via
              satellite data.  Consequently, this study may yield valuable information about
              carbon storage and peat formation in the Alaskan tundra.
