Cornell University will continue operations of the Jicamarca
              Radio Observatory (JRO) located near Lima, Peru.  The main instrument at JRO is
              the 50 MHz incoherent scatter radar.  Also on site are other antennas (some
              steerable, some broad beam) that are used for studies of plasma instabilities. 
              Nearby instruments used for coordinated experiments include a digisonde,
              magnetometers and optical instruments.  The scientific research conducted by
              JRO staff and other visiting scientists includes studies of the thermal
              structure of the equatorial ionosphere, low latitude electrodynamics, plasma
              instabilities, and thermospheric and mesospheric dynamics.  A new capability of
              the radar called JULIA allows the radar to be operated almost continuously in a
              low power mode to study the occurrence and evolution of plasma instabilities in
              the equatorial ionosphere.   Major research topics include:  (1) the thermal
              structure of the equatorial ionosphere, (2) low latitude electrodynamics during
              both quiet and disturbed times, (3) plasma instabilities in the E-region
              electrojet, in the region near 150 km altitude, and in the F region, (4) lower
              thermosphere dynamics and the effects of winds and waves in the neutral
              atmosphere, (5) equatorial mesospheric dynamics and the effect of the
              mesosphere on higher regions, and (6) minor studies of other phenomena, such 
              as long term changes in the geomagnetic field.  Science activities at Jicamarca
              contribute to understanding of global change and space weather.
