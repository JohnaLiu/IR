This award supports development of collaboration with Chinese
              researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Zoology to study
              the trophic transfer of contaminants to fish in Chinese lakes.  The funds will
              be used to support a planning visit by the three PIs and one graduate
              student.

Consumption of contaminated fish is a public health concern because
              fish are known conduits of exposure to contaminants such as PCB's and mercury
              by humans and wildlife.  Fish accumulate contaminants over their lifetime, so
              their body burdens build up to levels significantly greater than those in the
              water. A mechanistic understanding of movement through the food chain in
              aquatic food webs is lacking for most contaminants but is urgently needed to
              predict the types of lakes and food webs that present the greatest risk to
              humans via fish consumption. Through this collaboration with China, there will
              be opportunities to combine interests and expertise to try to better understand
              the potential for human exposure to contaminants via the aquatic 
food chain.
