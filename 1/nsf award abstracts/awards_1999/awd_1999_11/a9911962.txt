Award is for a geophysical study of the western and
              central Gulf of Aden conjugate continental margins to define the tectonic,
              stratigraphic, and magmatic development of one of the world's key areas for
              understanding how the initiation of continental rifting proceeds. 
              Deep-penetration, multi-channel reflection and Ocean Bottom Seismometer (OBS)
              refraction data, swath bathymmetry, magnetic, and gravity data will be
              collected in support of the objectives, which are centered around determining
              how the Afar mantle plume has affected the development of continental breakup
              and rift-flank structural development in the Gulf of Aden area.  Specifically,
              variation of strain partitioning, magmatism, and crustal structure with
              variation of distance from the Afar plume will be examined in the course of
              reconstructing conjugate margin evolution.  This work will also serve as a site
              survey in support of the ODP pre-proposal 528-Pre, and addresses an important
              goal of the ODP Long Range Plan, that of understanding early conjugate-margin
              development and continent-ocean transitions.
