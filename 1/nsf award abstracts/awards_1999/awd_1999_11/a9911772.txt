This project will produce a professional development
              package based on an interdisciplinary investigation of the use and disposal of
              chemical pollutants.  This theme allows integration of the content into biology
              and chemistry courses as well as courses in mathematics, social studies,
              civics, health and others.  The approach is to field test and refine the
              package, ultimately producing a combination of web-based instructional
              materials and CD-ROM's for high school teachers.  This will be accomplished
              through a series of On-line and On-site Institutes.  Teachers will be given
              guidance on how to train students to collect their own data, how to access
              other data sets on-line, and how to do real-life problem solving using GIS. 
              Among the goals are to provide cross-disciplinary content, provide a model for
              formulating pivotal questions, provide technical tools appropriate to
              facilitate cross-disciplinary linkages, provide inquiry-based activities,
              provide assessment strategies, and make TIES accessible to educators regardless
              of location.  Because of the cross-disciplinary nature of the professional
              development package, teachers will be able to utilize their skills to enhance
              teaching in a variety of subjects (chemistry, biology and environmental
              science), and can be incorporated into the classroom no matter which set of
              student instructional materials are used.  Teachers from urban, suburban and
              rural communities in Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania will
              field-test the materials at Summer Institutes and during the academic
              year.
