The objective of this project
              is to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of catalyst degradation
              through sintering.  The two main modes of industrial catalyst deactivation are
              poisoning and sintering.  During catalyst sintering, metal may migrate to form
              larger particles or sintering of the support may lead to encapsulation of the
              metal.  Sintering is a mode of catalyst deactivation in many applications
              including automotive catalytic converters and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. 
              Mechanistic understanding of sintering processes is limited and based primarily
              on model catalysts.  Several surface techniques are proposed to improve the
              present state of knowledge; these include small angle x-ray and neutron
              scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction.  Methods
              to control the nano-scale surface topology of catalyst supports, based on
              analytical results, will be developed. Understanding of the redispersion
              process could suggest strategies where periodic regeneration of the catalyst
              could be carried out in-situ.  If successful, this project could lead to
              improved catalyst design for high temperature processes.
