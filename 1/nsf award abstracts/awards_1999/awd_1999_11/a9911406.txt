Abstract    :
              This proposal will attempt to reconstruct sea surface salinity in the eastern
              equatorial Pacific and Caribbean during the last glacial period.  The project
              will estimate sea surface temperature using Mg/Ca in planktic foraminiferal
              shells, as well as from faunal assemblage of radiolaria and foraminifera.  18 O
              in planktic foraminifera will then be partitioned into temperature and salinity
              components.  The goal is to test results of an atmospheric circulation model
              which predicts that the transport of water vapor between the tropical Atlantic
              and Pacific oceans varies with large-scale climate changes.
