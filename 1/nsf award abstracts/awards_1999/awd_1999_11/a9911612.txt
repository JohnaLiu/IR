              ABSTRACT

Seawater that circulates
              within submarine hydrothermal systems undergoes profound chemical change as it
              traverses high temperature and pressure conditions that are far different from
              those of the ambient ocean. Consequently, the hydrothermal water venting from
              the seafloor is markedly different in composition from the seawater from which
              it is derived, and for some elements represents an important component of the
              global mass balance. To understand this process, the rock/water ratio of
              reactions beneath the seafloor must be understood. In this work,  Li isotope
              systematics in mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems will be investigated
              because Li has been found to be a good tool for understanding the rock/water
              behavior within the seafloor systems. The Li isotopic composition of previously
              collected hydrothermal fluids will be determined on samples that have already
              been analyzed for major and minor elements and for Li concentration. These
              samples are from four different sites along the mid-ocean ridge system.
