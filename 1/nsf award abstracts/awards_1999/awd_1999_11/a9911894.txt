This unusual five-year Teacher Student Development through
              Research Experience (TSD) project brings together real life miners, research
              scientists, and teachers in a working mine and inactive mines to participate in
              mining activities and the associated laboratory research activities surrounding
              minerals.  In year-one, 24 teachers from the Upper Peninsula of MI will
              participate in a six-week program that includes: content and skills
              preparation; working with scientists and engineers, in working and inactive
              mines, collecting specimens and cataloging them; and, hone leadership and
              change agent skills to enhance the transfer of the research/high tech mining
              experience back to the classroom.  The six-week summer research and field
              experiences are complemented by professional development activities over a
              12-month period. In years two and three the participant pool will include
              teachers from neighboring states:  WI, MN, IN, OH, and IL.  Each year 24
              additional middle and high school teachers will participate.  In years four and
              five teachers will come from a national pool focusing on those regions that
              have extensive mining activities.  Teachers may earn five (5) graduate credits
              from MTU.
