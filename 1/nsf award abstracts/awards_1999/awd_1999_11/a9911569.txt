"Technology Modules on the World-Wide-Web" is a collaboration
              between engineering and technology education faculty members from two SUNY
              campuses, to design and develop six Technology Education modules for grades 11
              and 12.  The modules are accessible through the world-wide web, but also via
              CD-ROM.  Topics are Principles of Engineering; Product Development and
              Automation; Energy and the Environment; Communication and Information
              Technology; Transportation; and System Integration and Society.  The modules
              allow computer-assisted simulation, and are meant to supplement the more
              typical hands-on activities of technology teachers.  The primary pedagogic
              strategy is case-based learning, each case involving a real-world technology
              situation, such as retro-fitting the lighting system of a house to make it more
              energy efficient.  Manuals are prepared to guide teachers through cases. 
              National pilot field test sites are integral to the evaluation. 

The project
              draws upon materials previously developed in the National Science Foundation's
              Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program in areas such as information
              systems, and semi-conductor manufacturing.  The materials resonate with the
              emerging national Standards for Technology Education now being finalized by the
              International Technology Education Association (ITEA); and relate directly to
              technology education content and learning standards of New York's Mathematics,
              Science and Technology (MST) curriculum, and to Project 2061 benchmarks.
