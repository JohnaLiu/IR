The purpose of this proposal is to support a team of U.S.
              engineering educators for participating in the International Conference on
              Engineering Education, ICEE 2000 Taipei, Taiwan.  The participation in this
              conference will strengthen the collaborations that nucleated during ICEE 97
              (Chicago), ICEE 98 (Rio de Janeiro) and ICEE-99 (Ostrava) and accompanying
              international workshops.  Consistent with the commitment made last year by
              Taiwan, Brazil and the Czech Republic, this team will constitute the U.S.
              delegation to the ICEE 2000 and the follow-on International Workshop.  A
              secondary purpose of this proposal is to support dissemination of the
              curriculum reform philosophy beyond the U.S. by targeted participation in ICEE
              2000.  This will be accomplished through key presentations, the conducting of
              workshops, and participation in symposia and panel discussions.  The
              availability of  a travel grant will enable the participation of US delegation
              in this important international conference.
