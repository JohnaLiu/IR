The Cosmic Ray Observatory Project (CROP) is a four-year
              project that involves Nebraska teachers and students in the detection of very
              high-energy cosmic rays.  Each summer six new high school teams of one teacher
              and up to three students will participate.  Participation begins with a
              four-week session at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln working to set up CROP
              detectors, troubleshoot the instrumentation, collect data, interpret local
              cosmic ray event data, and share the extremely high energy cosmic ray event
              data with colleagues from around the state.  Over the four years of the project
              30 teachers and 240 students will have participated in structured research
              activities with the senior scientists.  CROP involves teachers and students in
              a fundamental physics research experience, beginning with pre-data collection
              activities such as detector refurbishing and installation, debugging of the
              electronics locally, calibration of equipment, continuous data collection and
              maintenance of the experimental components.  It is research that depends on
              students and teachers in a meaningful way. "The experiments begin right in the
              classroom, continue through the school year, and via coordinated Internet
              sharing of data, extends beyond the schoolyard's boundaries.  The anticipated,
              extremely high-energy cosmic ray events require a very large distributed array
              of detectors that can be regularly maintained.  The location on school roofs
              across the State of Nebraska provides that.  The transfer to the classroom is
              enhanced by the self-contained classroom activities that have been developed
              for this purpose and are tied to the instrumentation and data collection as
              well as the decay of cosmic rays.  This carefully crafted project mimics the
              way fundamental research is done; that's what's being done.
