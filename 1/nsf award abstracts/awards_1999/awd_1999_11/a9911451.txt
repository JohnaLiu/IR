Abstract    :
                  This RUI project is an investigation of the thermodynamics of polar
              stratospheric clouds (PSC's).  There is strong evidence that PSC's play an
              important role in the annual depletion of stratospheric ozone at the poles. 
              The chemical activity of PSC particles changes as a function of their physical
              state (solid or liquid) and their chemical composition.  This research project
              will investigate the solid/liquid phase diagrams of aqueous chemical systems
              that make up PSC's using differential scanning calorimetry  and infrared
              spectroscopy.  The systems to be investigated include the nitric acid/water
              binary system and the nitric acid/sulfuric acid/water ternary system.  The
              results will have implications for understanding and modeling heterogeneous
              reactions that affect stratospheric ozone.
