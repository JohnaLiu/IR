This study examines, for the first time, the
              relationship between disability and nonstandard hours of employment among
              employed Americans.  Two basic hypotheses are addressed: (1) disabled workers
              are more likely than other workers to be employed evenings, nights or on
              rotating shifts; and (2) disabled workers are more likely to receive lower
              wages and less fringe benefits than other workers, particularly if they are
              working nonstandard hours, and if they are disabled.  It is expected that these
              relationships will hold true in when multivariate analyses that control for
              differences in social and demographic factors are performed.  It is also
              expected that there will be significant interaction effects showing that the
              nature of these relationships is conditional upon, race, ethnicity, and
              gender.

A nationally representative survey, the Medical Expenditure Panel
              Survey, 1996 Household Component, will be used to test these hypotheses.  For
              the purposes of this study, the sample is limited to individuals aged 18 and
              over (approximately 14,800 individuals), and will focus primarily on the subset
              of those employed.  This is the first time this federal survey has included
              information on which hours Americans are employed as well as how many hours. 
              Such data allow for exploratory research to test the proposed hypotheses and
              lay the groundwork for future sociological research in this area.  By
              considering disability jointly with issues of race, ethnicity, and gender, all
              in the context of employment during nonstandard work hours, the research will
              increase our understanding of the nature of social inequality and social
              stratification-areas central to sociological theory and analysis.  Further, the
              study should better inform public policy seeking to improve the employment
              situation of disabled persons.
