Abstract    :
              Falkowski  9911948

In this study, Falkowski and Kolber will use an Small
              Grant for Exploratory Research award to develop an Infrared Fast Repetition
              Rate fluorometer (IR-FRRF) as a novel technology for the detection of
              photosynthetic bacteria in the sea. Current evidence of geothermal and/or
              geochemically produced light associated with deep sea vents may indicate that
              non-solar driven photosynthesis could exist on the sea floor.  This research
              would enable the quantification of the contribution of light-driven metabolism
              to the overall bioenergetic budget in these bacteria in situ.  This instrument
              will provide new capabilities in exploring the hypothesis that
              photosynthetically active bacteria live in or near deep sea vent associated
              light regions. In collaboration with Dr. Cindy Van Dover, the instrument will
              be taken to sea in November and December 1999 for examination of samples
              retrieved by Alvin from vents on the Pacific Rise.
