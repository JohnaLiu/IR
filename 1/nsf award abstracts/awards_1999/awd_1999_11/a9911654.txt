Abstract    :
              This project will collect benthic foraminifera from intermediate-depth waters
              off the coast of the Carolinas, to determine which species are reliable tracers
              of bottom water chemistry (Ba, Cd and 13C).  Fluorescent labelling will be used
              to determine the life position of specimens; geochemistry of bottom water will
              be compared with that of the foraminiferal shells; and speciments will be
              cultured under controlled conditions.  Identification of reliable tracers will
              permit more accurate estimates of past changes in circulation.
