"PRIME" is a collaborative effort involving Illinois State
              University's Mathematics Education faculty and Peoria District 150.  Targeting
              the second largest urban school district in Illinois, this Local Systemic
              Change project will serve all 337 K-5 classroom mathematics teachers, and their
              principals.  The project was developed in response to teachers' request for
              professional support in implementing "Investigations in Number, Data and
              Space," a reform elementary mathematics curriculum that is aligned with both
              state and national standards. 

This 3.5-year teacher enhancement program
              involves each teacher in nearly 150 hours of professional learning. This
              program features three intensive summer sessions focused on improving teachers'
              understanding of mathematics content -- geometry, rational numbers, data and
              statistics -- and teaching practices related to the implementation of the
              Investigations program.  Systematic, substantive follow-through during
              subsequent school years in the form of grade level seminars, after school
              workshops, and extensive, classroom-based support from "PRIME" staff, will be
              provided.  A Mathlinks Committee of 32 lead teachers from the 16 schools
              participating in the Project serves to monitor grade-level coordination and
              implementation of Investigations, and provides local input to PRIME staff for
              project activity. The PRIME project further benefits from significant support
              from a parent, community and business collaboration that focuses on student
              learning. By engaging all stakeholders, the PRIME collaborative seeks to
              promote and support qualitatively different approaches for teaching and teaming
              K-5 mathematics.
