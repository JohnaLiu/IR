              Instrumentation:  Emulate the Performance of Wide Area Networks

The
              Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University
              will purchase computing and network equipment.  This equipment includes two
              24-port rackmount switches, an 8-port router, PCs for network emulation, four
              web servers, one RAID server, six mobile computing devices with wireless
              networking components, a wireless access point, and racks, monitors, and other
              devices to support the rackmounted system.  This equipment will be used to
              implement the EMPOWER (EMulate the PerfOmance of WidE aRea networks)
              environment that will be dedicated to support research in computer science and
              engineering.  EMPOWER enables the emulation of arbitrary network topologies,
              including interconnected host machines and routers contains both WAN ports and
              LAN ports.  Beyond emulation of network bandwidth, drop rates and patterns,
              delay distributions, and background traffic, EMPOWER provides an excellent
              environment to implement and evaluate different QoS schemes  (such as
              differentiated services) and label swapping schemes (such as MPLS).  Current
              research includes emulation kernel design, routing table configuration, network
              statistics visualization, and GUI to configure the network easily.
