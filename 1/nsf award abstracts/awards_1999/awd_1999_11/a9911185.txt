Abstract    :
              This project focuses on informed consent in online interactions and communities.
              Informed consent refers to the principle that individuals should be informed
              about the harms and benefits of participating in a particular activity, and
              should have a say in whether they participate or not. Despite the importance of
              informed consent during transactions on the World Wide Web (e.g., in fostering
              a climate of trust and protecting individuals' privacy), little attention has
              been paid to the ways in which particular Web programming tools enhance or
              impede its existence. This research project will 1) develop criteria and
              metrics for assessing the degree and kind of informed consent available in
              particular Web designs and 2) identify promising approaches for the development
              of new Web-based programming languages that would support the ready
              availability of informed consent for users.
