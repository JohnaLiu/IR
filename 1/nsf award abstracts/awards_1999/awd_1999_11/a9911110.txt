Abstract    :
              This award supports a collaborative research project between Joseph Duffy,
              Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Florida, and Jan Snyman,
              Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Pretoria, South Africa. 
              The investigators will conduct research in optimizing dexterous work spaces,
              minimizing actuator forces and energy use required in the execution of tasks by
              robot manipulators.  The investigators at the two institutions have
              successfully performed jonit work during the past two years on Stewart
              platforms.  

The research groups have complementary expertise.  The work
              done at the University of Florida is focused on optimizing platform design
              using geometry, kinematics, and statics, while researchers at the University of
              Pretoria who have extensive experience in the optimization of serial robot
              manipulators propose to extend and to apply this knowledge to parallel devices
              for machining operations.  The integration of results should provide a designer
              with much valuable data that will enable the production of an optimum or near
              optimum design for a range of tasks.  The research also shows important
              potential impact on the manufacturing industry of South Africa and other
              developing countries as well as on that of the United States.  The
              implementation of this technology lies primarily in retrofitting existing
              non-CNC milling equipment to increase their capability at a lower cost than
              that of the alternate of purchasing traditional 5-axis machining centers.
