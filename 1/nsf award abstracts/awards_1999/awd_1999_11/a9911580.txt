Title:				Cation Separations Using New Swelling
              Micas


The objective of this project is to synthesize cost-effectively
              Na-2-mica and Na-3-mica with theoretical exchange capacities of about 230 and
              345 meq/100g, respectively, to characterize the phases by a battery of
              techniques including 27Al and 29Si MASNMR spectroscopy, and to investigate
              their actual cation exchange capacities and equilibria (selectivity).  Exchange
              equilibria will be determined on synthetic micas for ions such as Sr2+, Ra2+, 
              Ba2+, Cs+, Cu2+ and Pb2+.   The structures of the novel Na-2-mica and Na-3-mica
              exchangers will be determined by 27Al and 29Si magic-angle spinning nuclear
              magnetic resonance spectroscopy in order to relate their structures to their
              properties (selectivities).  We will also investigate the acid and temperature
              stability of these materials for practical applications and the reversible
              recovery of selected metals such as Cu by changing temperature, pH, etc., and
              by complexation.  

The results of the study should contribute much to basic
              understanding of the ion-exchange behavior of  novel swelling micas.  Such
              materials offer potentially important waste-disposal applications, such as high
              ion selectivity for separation and fixation of radioactive and other hazardous
              ions.  The fundamental knowledge gained here may also lead to applications in
              metals recovery from solubilized ores or waste water, in catalysis, as well as
              in waste remediation processes.  For example, the materials developed here
              might be used as permeable reactive walls that trap radioactive and other
              hazardous ions but transmit clean water.
