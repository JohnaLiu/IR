This project will develop text-based instructional
              materials that allow the interweaving of 1st- and 2nd-hand investigations in
              order to maximize children's learning about the products of science as well as
              the nature of scientific reasoning.  These materials are modeled after a
              scientist's notebook:  a new genre that they developed to promote the
              maintenance of an inquiry stance while conducting investigation with text. 
              These notebook texts are tailored to elementary school science curricula in
              grades one through five:  Insights, Science and Technology for Children (STC),
              and Full Option Science Study (FOSS).
