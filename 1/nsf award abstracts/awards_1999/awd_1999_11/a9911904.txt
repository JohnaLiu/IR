MASE K-5 is a five-year Local Systemic Change project designed
              to deepen K-5 science and mathematics education reform in the Clark County
              School District of Nevada.  The University of Nevada at Las Vegas and the
              greater Nevada University System will cooperate with the District by providing
              professional development and content expertise.  The 1,033 elementary teachers
              in 18 schools in the project will take part in the 130 hours of professional
              development during the life of the project.

The MASE K-5 project builds on
              prior LSC projects in several ways.  Six of the strongest MASE schools will now
              be utilized as leadership sites by becoming Collaborative Learning Center
              Schools (CLCS) in each geographic area of the District.  These CLCS will be
              models of best practice that will guide the implementation of innovative,
              reform-based curricula and pedagogy.  CLCS will pair with new project schools,
              thus mentoring and assisting new schools while advancing their own practice. 
              Teachers from new project schools will take part in demonstration/laboratory
              lessons and other professional development opportunities at the CLCS. 
              Professional development for MASE K-5 teachers will be offered during
              workshops, seminars and institutes as well as during site-based study groups. 
              The MASE K-5 project will utilize Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSAs) and
              Lead Teachers who already are professional development leaders in the District.
              These teachers will assist in the leadership of the project by co-teaching
              (with content experts and outside consultants) the summer institutes and
              workshops, leading study groups, facilitating school-based sessions, conducting
              demonstration/laboratory lessons at the CLCS, and other leadership development
              and organizational tasks.
