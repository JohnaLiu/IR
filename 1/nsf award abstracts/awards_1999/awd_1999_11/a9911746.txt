This planning grant supports the design and pilot testing of
              a prototype which will be used to establish a school-based, student documented
              arboretum.  The project will provide the support need for elementary and middle
              schools to use the trees in their schoolyard for long-term, inquiry oriented
              studies.  Two prototype databases will be established and made available
              through the web site, one for student research on selection or identification,
              the other for record keeping.
