The proposal is for a five-year LSC project submitted by the
              Capital Region Science Education Partnership (CRSEP) in collaboration with the
              University at Albany SUNY.  The partnership includes the Schenectady City
              School District, Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake central Schools, Watervliet City
              Schools and Bethlehem Central Schools, a combination of high poverty urban and
              suburban districts.  All the districts have implemented the instructional
              materials, Science and Technology for Children (STC) in grades K-6 and MS/STC
              units are currently being field-tested.  The professional development program
              for teachers includes the use of formative assessment in the service of
              teaching.  Central to the partners' belief is the tenet that recognizes
              assessment not only as a means to measure student achievement but also as a
              catalyst for effective contemporary science education reform.  An applied
              research component will study and evaluate the effectiveness of this unique
              approach to professional development and materials for use by professional
              developers nationwide will be produced.  The project will involve all 427
              teachers of science grades K-8 in 28 schools in the four districts.
