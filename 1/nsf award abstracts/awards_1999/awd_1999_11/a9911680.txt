Abstract    :
              This project will conduct a forum on systemic reform of mathematics and science
              education.  The forum, the second jointly sponsored by the United States and
              South Africa, will explore a variety of topics related to systemic reform, with
              particular emphasis on professional development, curriculum materials, and
              assessment as it relates to educational reform.  It will provide opportunties
              to share experiences among U.S., South African, and Australian scholars who are
              both studying and implementing educational reform.
