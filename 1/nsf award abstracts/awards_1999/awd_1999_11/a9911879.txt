Abstract    :
              This project will perform an extensive laboratory calibration on a high
              temperature fluid resistivity electrode instrument and will construct and
              deploy four (4) additional instruments in an experiment at the Mail Endeavour
              vent field.  The purpose of the instrument is to simultaneously measure in situ
              salinity and temperature in the hydrothermal fluids as a means of evaluating
              the temporal nature of the phase separation at the site.
