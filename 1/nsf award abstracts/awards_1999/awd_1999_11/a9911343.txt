The primary objective of this award is to support expenses to
              manage a workshop.  Attendees will be assembled to discuss the significance of
              creating a national database on women in civil engineering, and to develop the
              framework for such a database.  Through this mechanism, a more efficient and
              effective method will be available to identify issues and challenges faced by
              women in engineering, as well as tracking the recruitment and retention of
              women in civil engineering.  This database will also be able to track the
              advancement of women in the engineering profession and assist in determining
              best practices.  The workshop, to be organized in conjunction with the National
              Academy of Engineers, will result in the establishment of a team of engineering
              experts who will collectively work toward the creation of a national database
              on women in all fields of engineering.
