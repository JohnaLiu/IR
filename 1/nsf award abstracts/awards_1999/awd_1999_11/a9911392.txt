Investigators at Univ. California-Berkley will
              collaborate with scientists at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)
              to install a long-term three-component broadband seismometer system on the
              seafloor in Monterey Bay between 700-1200m below the sea surface. MBARI will
              provide data-logger, lithium batteries, ship and ROV time and will build the
              seismometer housing. NSF support will provide an ocean bottom seismic package
              including 3 component broadband seismometers, 24-bit A/D converter, and
              automatic gimbaled centering and leveling system. Funding is also provided for
              software modification/development to interface the seismometer package with the
              recording system. MBARI will provide engineering time and UC Berkeley will
              provide expertise in broadband seismology, data acquisition, telemetry,
              processing and archival.  

The new installation will complement the
              land-based network of broadband seismic stations and will provide 1) better
              azimuthal coverage and thereby improve the characterization of moderate to
              large earthquakes occurring in northern California along the San Andreas
              system, and 2) improved knowledge of the deep structure of this plate boundary.
              Experience in long term deployment of broadband systems will be gained in the
              context of plans for the development of long term global seismic sea floor
              observatories.
