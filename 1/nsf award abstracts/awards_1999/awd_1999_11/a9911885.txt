This three-year "Teacher/Student Development through
              Research Experience" project (TSD) involves 25 teachers per year, grades 7-12,
              in a high tech workplace/research experience.  Each of these teachers will
              mentor at least four of their peers for a minimum of 60 hours.  The summer
              experience includes 3-weeks in an industrial internship at Peavey Electronics. 
              A fourth week will be spent at Mississippi State where the teachers receive
              heop with the transfer to the classroom component.  A 3-day work experience in
              a local industry (local to the teacher's place of employment), and academic
              year follow-up sessions follow this. The content sessions are concurrent with
              and interspersed with the the internship at Peavey Electronics.  The sessions
              include work with the SCANS report.  They are delivered using the industrial
              model of just-in-time-learning.  The workplace mentors are engineers,
              scientists and workers at Peavey Electronics as well as university faculty,
              scientists, and highly qualified teachers.  Teachers will ideally participate
              as teams from the same school.  The ideal team has a science, mathematics and a
              technology education teacher. To ensure participation from districts with
              limited resources and a high minority enrollment, a commitment has been made by
              two such school districts to participate in the project.  Five teachers from
              each district will participate.
