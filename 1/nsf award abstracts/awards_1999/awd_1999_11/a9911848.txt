This project, sponsored by the University of North Carolina
              at Greensboro, will carry out a project to teach teachers in North Carolina the
              modeling method pioneered by Hestenes et al at Arizona State University.  The
              institution has created a collaboration with neighboring state institutions
              (Appalachian State University and North Carolina A&T), the North Carolina
              Department of Public Instruction and local school districts.  The program will
              teach the modeling method to physics teachers, physical science teachers and
              technology teachers.  Altogether 356 teachers will be involved in modeling
              workshops and each teacher will be in the project for two summers.  A group of
              Master Teachers, trained during in the summer workshops, will be expected to
              implement the modeling method in their classrooms and, with the help of the
              resources on the web specifically developed for the project, will help peer
              teachers also implement the modeling method in their classrooms.  At the same
              time as the development of the on-site program for teachers, an on-line
              resource will be developed which will be available to teachers at the national
              level.  This interactive web-site will be an "anytime, anywhere" source of
              information for teachers throughout the country and will also be available to
              provide graduate credit for those teachers who fulfill appropriate
              requirements.  This site will demonstrate the modeling approach of Hestenes and
              demonstrate to teachers how to move students through their misconceptions of
              simple physics principles.  It is estimated that 150 teachers will take
              advantage of the credit option. 

Matching funds amount to 27% of the NSF
              award.
