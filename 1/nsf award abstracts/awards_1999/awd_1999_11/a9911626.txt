Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates:  Research Experiences In Computer Science for Students at
              Undergraduate Institutions

Berque, DePauw University, CISE/REU sites  The
              primary objective of this project is to encourage talented students enrolled at
              undergraduate institutions to pursue graduate study and research careers in
              Computer Science. The program directly impacts twenty-four students (eight per
              summer) by giving them first-hand experience with several of the most rewarding
              activities that characterize graduate study and research careers. research
              project topics are selected from the faculty mentors' current areas of
              interest.  Students have full access to DePauw University's library and
              computing facilities including specialized equipment such as a 72" diagonal
              touchsensitive interactive whiteboard which supports some of the projects.   
              Each student  has several opportunities to present his/hers work more formally
              to other participants in the REU program, as well as to external audiences.
              Finally, the students have the chance to attend talks given by the faculty
              mentors and visitors, and to learn about the graduate school application
              process in part by visiting a major research university.
