Abstract    :
              Award is for 40 Ar/39 Ar incremental heating re-dating of previously-collected
              lava samples from the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain to more precisely
              determine its volcanic evolution.  This seamount chain represents the "trace"
              of excess volcanism associated with the Hawaiian plume, showing how the Pacific
              Plate has moved relative to the plume, most likely of deep mantle origin. 
              Previous whole-rock K-Ar dates of these samples are too imprecise to address
              fundamental questions about whether the Hawaiian plume, the most important and
              largest plume on earth, is fixed relative to the earth's mantle.  The more
              precise 40 Ar/39 Ar incremental heating dates will allow for more precise
              resolution of plume location and Hawaiian-Emperor volcanism and
              edifice-building with time, resolution needed to accurately compare the
              Hawaiian-Emperor chain end with other tectonic features of the Pacific plate
              and to fundamentally address the issue of whether this plume has moved relative
              to the mantle in its history.
