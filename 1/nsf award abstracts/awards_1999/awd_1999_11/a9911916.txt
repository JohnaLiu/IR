Abstract    :
              This project will use the Dynamic Fluid-Kinetic computer code to examine the
              flow of ions along magnetic field lines.  Both inflow to the ionosphere and
              outflow of ions from the ionosphere will be examined.  The study will pay
              particular attention to the relationship of transport processes at different
              altitudes.  Results from the modeling will be compared with satellite data and
              incoherent-scatter radar data.
