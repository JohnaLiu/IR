This project is a collaboration between the City University
              of New York - City College (CUNY) and the Freudenthal Institute and will
              develop a variety of K-8 mathematics teacher inservice materials broadly
              related to number sense: (1) a documentary video on Number and Operation and
              (2) sets of materials for each of the grade bands of PK-2, 3-5, and 6-8.  Each
              set will contain a book, a hyper-linked text CD of the "Principles and
              Standards for School Mathematics" published by the National Council of Teachers
              of Mathematics (NCTM) related to number sense, and three interactive CDs for
              use in inservice activities with accompanying activity manuals for instructors.
               For grades PK-2 the focus is early number sense and addition/subtraction, for
              grades 3-5 the focus is multiplication and division, and for grades 6-8 the
              focus is fractions/decimals.  The project builds on existing, successful,
              face-to-face inservice with teachers; the materials will translate this
              inservice into a format that can be widely disseminated.  The materials are
              intended to be useful for both inservice and preservice education.  The
              materials will be field tested in university courses, LSC projects, Exxon
              Education Project sites, several "virgin" sites (where reform mathematics
              instruction is not already well entrenched), and an Internet site (funded by
              Heinemann Publishers).  It is expected the materials will be published by
              Heinemann, possibly in cooperation with NCTM.  Long-term use of the materials
              will be supported in teacher institutes through CUNY, with possible additional
              arrangements with Heinemann and NCTM.
