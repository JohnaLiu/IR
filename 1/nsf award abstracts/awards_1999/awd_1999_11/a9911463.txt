Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop a host strain and 
expression system
              that will allow high-level production of natural 
and un-natural terpenoids in
              Escherichia coli.  The specific aims 
of this project are to: (1) maximize the
              production of the 
isoprenoid precursor isopentyl diphosphate in E. coli by
              
expressing the genes for either the mevalonate-dependent or the
              
mevalonate-independent synthesis pathway using the metabolic 
engineering
              tools developed in the Principal Investigator's 
laboratory; (2) maximize
              production of the primary precursors to 
the terpenoids: geranyl diphosphate,
              farnesyl diphosphate, and 
geranylgernyldiphosphate; (3) introduce into E.
              coli the genes for 
specific classes of terpenoids and optimize production of
              these 
"natural" terpenoids; and (4) use laboratory evolution of terpene
              
cyclases to produce novel terpenoids or to change the distribution 
of
              products made by terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes.  This project 
is part of an
              Interagency Activity in Metabolic Engineering and is 
to be funded by the
              Office of Naval Research (ONR) and three 
Programs within NSF.
