              ABSTRACT

OCE-9911678

The quantitative relationship between organic matter
              falling through the water column and that accumulating in seafloor sediments
              presents one of the major challenges to understanding the organic chemistry of
              the ocean.  Although organic matter produced biologically in the upper ocean
              transfers a marine chemical signature to the sediments, the organic matter in
              surface sediments looks very different:  it is compositionally different,
              apparently enriched with terrestrial biomarkers and having radiocarbon ages
              suggesting input of old reworked material.  In this study, scientists at the
              Skidaway Institute of Oceanography will use paired samples of organic matter
              collected in sediment traps and underlying sediments to deduce the chemical
              character of the organic matter that is degraded (and thus removed) from
              sinking organic matter before it accumulates on the seafloor.  First, they will
              determine the molecular and isotopic character of key biomarkers in sediment
              trap/sediment pairs from a variety of oceanic environments.  Secondly, they
              will use molecular and isotopic distributions to constrain the character of the
              bulk of organic carbon that is degraded in the water column and at the
              sediment-water interface, the loss of which determines the nature of the
              organic carbon that can be accumulated in sediments and preserved in the
              sedimentary record.
