Abstract    :
              This project is to use a novel bioinformatics approach for modeling metabolic
              pathways.  There are four steps to the Principal Investigators' strategy: (1)
              complex biological information is to be organized and integrated into a single
              consistent metabolic knowledge base (MKB), which will serve as a basis for the
              remaining steps; (2) a novel biocatalysis classification scheme (BCS) is to be
              induced from available information about catalyzed biochemical transformations;
              (3) the correlations between known protein properties and their catalytic
              function is to be used to learn novel empirical mappings between proteins and
              their function, which is to form the basis of a biocatalytic assignment tool
              (BAT); and (4) a metabolic pathway synthesis (MPS) system is to be designed to
              use induced knowledge about metabolism to generate new pathways between given
              compounds. Together, these four modules are to form the basis of a system for
              modeling metabolic pathways that can be used to solve a number of difficult
              problems.
