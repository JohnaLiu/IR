SGER: Robust Multi-objective Active Vision Systems

This is a SGER
              standard award.  Recent hardware advances have rendered active vision a viable
              option for a very diverse spectrum of applications ranging from MEMS
              
manufacture to vision assisted surgery. However, in order for active 
vision
              to gain widespread application, the problem of fragility (i.e. 
lack of
              robustness) of systems designed using classical approaches
must be addressed.
              This project aims to explore the feasibility of solving this 
difficulty
              through a multidisciplinary approach, which brings to bear on 
the problem new
              multi-objective robust control and robust vision tools 
that are just starting
              to emerge in the respective communities. Specifically, 
The PIs will use
              robust feature modeling and identification techniques to 
recast the problem
              into a multi-objective control form that can be exactly 
solved using convex
              optimization techniques. If successful, this effort 
will result in an
              expanded robust active vision framework, capable of 
addressing multiple
              performance specifications and uncertainty. The results 
obtained from this
              research are expected to show that a tight integration of  
the control and
              vision aspects of the problem in a unified framework leads 
to substantial
              improvements both in performance and flexibility.
