              ABSTRACT

OCE-9911649


The biogeochemistry of the production, cycling, and
              loss methane, an important greenhouse gas, in the world ocean is very
              imperfectly understood.  Several lines of evidence suggest that the oceanic
              pycnocline (the vertical zone in which seawater density increases relatively
              rapidly with depth) is a zone of particularly intense methanogenesis. 
              Suspended particulates, which tend to accumulate in this zone and thus offer an
              interface for the microbial activity driving methanogenesis, may provide the
              sites where this chemical activity is concentrated.    In this project,
              investigators from the University of Hawaii will study the details of
              particle-associated and water-column methane production in the pycnocline of
              the eastern tropical North Pacific, including the possibility that methane
              production and oxidation is driven algal exudates.   The field study will
              occupy stations along a well documented oxidation-reduction gradient extending
              from the upwelling-induced anoxic zone offshore of Mexico and extending to the
              oxygen minimum of the Pacific central gyre, thus covering a range of oxygen
              concentrations, particle loading rates, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen
              levels.  The study will also examine the role of nitrifying bacteria and the
              importance of dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration in methane
              oxidation.
