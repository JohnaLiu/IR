Abstract    :
              This project will conduct an isotopic tracer study of the Macquarie Island
              ophiolite to establish isotopic profiles through continuous sections of ocean
              basement in order to quantify isotopic exchange etween seawater and ocean
              crust, to understand controls on hydrothermal fluid compositions to trace
              water-rock interactions, and to study the metamorphic petrology of the plutonic
              section of the Macquarie ophiolite.
