Dunlap

This proposal is for a planning visit to the Philippines by
              Dr. Paul Dunlap, the University of Maryland.  The purpose of this planning
              visit is to enable Dr. Dunlap to meet with his Philippine counterparts to plan
              for a cooperative research project on the clonal diversity and ecology of
              Vibrio Harveyi, an ecologically and economically important coastal marine
              bacterium.  The study of microbial diversity is an exciting area in microbial
              ecology.  This is a well-designed visit to develop a potentially important
              project.
