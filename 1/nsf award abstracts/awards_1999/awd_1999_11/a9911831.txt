This two-year project will develop a prototype of
              professional development materials to help middle grades mathematics teachers
              learn how to adapt NSF middle grades curriculum materials, classroom practices,
              and assessments to meet the needs of students with cognitive and language
              disabilities.  The prototype will include sample lessons adapted from these
              curriculum materials to provide models for teachers.  The materials will also
              help professional development providers assist mathematics and special
              education teachers in working together to improve instruction for students with
              the targeted disabilities.  The professional development materials will support
              teacher professional development activities across an entire school year, with
              mathematics and special education teachers meeting together in study groups
              approximately once a month.  Teachers will learn about the principles of
              universal design for learning and then complete "design experiments" in which
              they will apply these principles to adapt instruction to account for the
              targeted disabilities.  The professional development materials to be developed
              in this project will address requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities
              Education Act 1997.  The materials will be piloted in several school districts
              in the Boston area and will be evaluated through analysis of teachers' design
              experiments, self-reports, and action plans.
