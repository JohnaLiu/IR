              ABSTRACT

Phytoplankton productivity in high
              nutrient, low chlorophyll areas is limited by the bioavailability of iron. 
              Iron uptake by marine microorganisms appears to be strongly influenced by the
              redox and solution speciation of dissolved Fe, yet very little is known about
              the physical-chemical processes such as photochemical reduction, colloid
              formation, and organic complexation that affect Fe chemistry and
              bioavailability in the oceans.  For this reason, the principal investigators
              propose to undertake a set of process-oriented studies to investigate (1) the
              diel photochemical and thermochemical redox cycling of Fe in the upper 100
              meters of  the Gulf of Mexico (GOM); (2) the redox speciation of dissolved Fe
              supplied by wet (rainfall) and dry (aerosol) deposition, and the
              physical-chemical transformations that occur within the first few hours
              following deposition; and (3) the complexation and potential reduction of
              Fe(III) by colloidal and low molecular weight dissolved organic ligands in the
              open oligotrophic GOM, and including ligands from natural diatom blooms,
              harmful algae (dinoflagellate) blooms, and from riverine input of terrestrial
              aquatic organic ligands.   It is expected that results from this study will
              further our understanding of the abiotic, inorganic processes regulating the
              distribution and speciation of Fe, as well as provide data required to model
              oceanic Fe cycling.
