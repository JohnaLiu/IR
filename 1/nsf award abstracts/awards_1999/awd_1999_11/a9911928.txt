"Project MERIT:  Mathematics Education Reform Initiative for
              Teachers," a five-year Teacher Enhancement project, continues and expands a
              prior NSF-supported planning project to address the established need of middle
              school mathematics teachers to improve knowledge of the content of mathematics
              and how students learn mathematics.  MERIT builds capacity for change through
              professional development by nurturing a mathematics leadership team (MLTs) and
              125 mentor teachers (MMTs), one or more from each of the 55 county school
              systems in West Virginia.  Using the NSF-supported MathScape instructional
              materials as the vehicle for change, MERIT provides for the systematic delivery
              of instruction in the pedagogical content knowledge of mathematics to more than
              950 middle grades mathematics teachers.  Over the life of the project, the
              35-member mathematics leadership team (MLTs) participates in 36 days of formal
              professional development; the 125 mentor teachers (MMTs), 45 days; the
              approximately 950 middle grades mathematics teachers, 18 days; school/county
              administrators, 9 days; and higher education faculty and administrators, 10
              days.

Project evaluation includes both student and teacher components. 
              Evaluation of student achievement is made using the Stanford Achievement Test-9
              (SAT-9) and ACT Explore.  The teacher component assesses growth in teacher
              content knowledge, pedagogical skills, and classroom implementation
              strategies.

The project is a collaborative effort among the W. Va.
              Department of Education, the University and State College Systems of W. Va.,
              the W. Va. Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and the W. Va. Mathematics and
              Science Coalition.
