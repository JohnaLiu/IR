CISE Research Instrumentation: 
              Research Infrastructure for Distributed and Data-Intensive Computing

The
              Department of Computer Science at Binghamton University will purchase
              components for a 32-node-dual-Pentium cluster and a closely coupled set of
              high-end workstations and servers, which will be dedicated to support research
              in computer and information science and engineering.  The equipment will be
              used for several research projects, including in particular:  (i) large-scale
              data visualization; (ii) distributed digital library; (iii) parallel discrete
              event simulation and (iv) object-based distributed computing infrastructure. 
              All four projects require a distributed high-performance platform (as provided
              by the cluster).  Moreover, the visualization and metasearch engine projects
              require large disk space and memory sizes to handle the immense data sets
              required by these applications (as provided by the high-end workstations and
              cluster node4s).  The simulation and visualization projects need the
              high-bandwidth low-latency communication provided by the Myrinet SAN network. 
              The choice of the cluster for the distributed platform is clear; the
              cost-effectiveness provided by tapping into the commodity component market
              makes them a superior value to custom parallel machines (shared Memory, NUMAs
              or MPPs).  There is no equivalent (or comparable) infrastructure available in
              the department; this equipment will be critical to the success of all four
              projects.
