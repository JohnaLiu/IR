Funds are provided for the determination,
              from numerical models, of Green's functions for the time-dependent,
              three-dimensional tracer equation.  These functions will then be used to
              determine tracer-independent transport properties from both model output and
              field observations of tracer distributions.  Sampling strategies for future
              field studies will also be designed.  This work should improve 
significantly
              our ability to understand the histories of water parcels leading to observed
              distributions of properties in the deep ocean and improve our ability to model
              climate scale variations in the ocean.
