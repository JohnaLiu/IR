"Virtual Immersion in Scientific Inquiry for Teachers (VISIT)" is
              an Online Collaboratory for teachers to participate in ongoing scientific
              investigations of contemporary problems in their localities.  This project will
              immerse 200 secondary teachers from Detroit and Boston in investigations that
              use extensive data analysis tools, supported by colleagues and scientists
              throughout the year.  These activities support state curricula and frameworks
              in chemistry, environmental science, ecology, biological and earth sciences.
              The investigators will receive graduate credit from EMU.  An additional 800
              teachers would be "explorers" with some limited exposure to key topics and
              skills.
 
The VISIT model and materials will be disseminated both nationally
              and in Southeastern Michigan through the educational programs of local, state,
              and national scientific government agencies, online courses, special science
              education projects and systemic initiative projects.  VISIT plans to engage at
              least 1,000 teachers over three years and to replicate the model and materials
              in at least six other urban areas.
