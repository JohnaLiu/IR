Abstract    :
              This project will test the hypothesis that in an African predator-prey system
              that consists of a terrestrial predator of frog eggs and an aquatic predator of
              frog larvae.   The PI's will test for higher-order interactions in this system
              through field surveys and artificial pond experiments.  Demographic models will
              then be used to extrapolate the short-term effects of the predators on prey
              mortaility to understand better their importance in determining prey population
              dynamics.  This research will faciliatea our understanding of the effects of
              competing HOIs on prey dynamics, quantify the status of amphibian populations
              in Tanzania, and enhance the ecological training of African and American
              biology students.
