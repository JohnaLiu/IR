Abstract    :
              


This project investigates the impact on identity of a struggle for land
              where the state has devised legal categories to specify race and ethnicity.
              Law, the investigators hypothesize, operates as a powerful social force,
              imposing categories and ordering social relations, and providing structures for
              self--identification and mobilization. The research will focus on the struggle
              for legally-guaranteed land rights by a community of descendants of Indians and
              a neighboring community of descendants of fugitive slaves in the backlands of
              Sergipe. Methods will include ethnographic field research, such as household
              surveys, participant observation, interviews, and collecting life stories,
              supplemented by documentary research. This research has significance for
              academics and policy-makers and will contribute to the fields of socio-legal
              studies, history, anthropology, and law. It will contribute to debates about
              legal treatment of mixed-race rural communities throughout Latin America.
