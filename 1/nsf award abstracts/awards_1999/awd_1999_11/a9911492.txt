Abstract    :
              This study will use a novel drifter design to follow water overflowing 
from
              the Norwegian Sea, into the main North Atlantic, through the Faroe 
Bank
              Channel.  By using a tag-line, the drifter will remain a small 
distance above
              the bottom until the overflow water descends to a 
predetermined depth.  A
              dozen drifters will be launched in the Faroe 
Bank Channel and tracked
              acoustically.  The path data and depth data 
will provide information about
              the overflow water's speed through the 
Faroe Bank Channel, the way in which
              the dense overflow water descends 
into the North Atlantic after it crosses
              the sill in the channel, and 
the way it circulates in the deep Iceland Basin.
               Temperature and 
pressure data recorded by the float will provide information
              about the 
rate of mixing between the overflow water and the surrounding
              water.
