Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to create a new paradigm in bioremediation of
              chlorinated solvents by metabolically engineering microorganisms for the rapid,
              long-term, aerobic biodegradation of perchloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene
              (TCE), and mixtures of these and other solvents.  No organisms are known to
              have these abilities, and development of such a strain would provide a new,
              cost-effective option for solving some of the world's most pervasive soil and
              groundwater pollution problems.  This research has four specific objectives:
              (1) use DNA shuffling to create an optimized monooxygenase that degrades PCE,
              TCE, and mixtures of chlorinated solvents; (2) clone this monooxygenase and
              epoxide hydrolase into two host strains; (3) evaluate the effects of this
              genetic engineering on host cell physiology using 2-dimensional protein
              electrophoresis; and (4) evaluate the fate of modified cells and introduced
              genes in soil and bioreactor 
settings.
