The purpose of this research is to develop a fundamental
              understanding of the atomic structure and properties of transformation in metal
              alloys.  Three main objectives are proposed:  (1) determination of the atomic
              structure, growth mechanisms and kinetics of ZrN plates and grains in Zr-N
              alloy for comparison with theories of phase transformations in interstitial
              alloy systems; (2) determination of the atomic structure and properties of
              solid-liquid interfaces in Al-Si/Ge alloys for comparison with atomistic
              calculations of solid-liquid interfaces and also with the theory of solute
              partitioning during solidification; and (3) determination of the atomic
              structure of massive transformation interfaces in Ti-Al and Fe-Ni alloys,
              combined with complementary development of crystallographic and kinetic
              theories for predicting the structure and behavior, respectively, of interfaces
              between phases with irrational orientation relationships and habit planes.  The
              main experimental techniques employed in this research include static and
              in-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
              energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), electron energy-loss spectroscopy
              (EELS), static and in-situ energy-filtering TEM, and atomic modeling of
              interfacial structure.

The results from this research will enable
              materials scientists to better understand and utilize fundamental principles of
              interface science and transformation theory in the development of metal alloys
              for a wide range of technologically important applications.  It contributes to
              human resources primarily through graduate education, providing students the
              opportunity to perform state-of-the-art research in phase transformations,
              interface science and high-resolution and analytical transmission electron
              microscopy.
