The proposal entitled Structural Disorder and Spectral
              Dynamics in Hyperquenched Glasses and other Condensed Phase Systems is an
              investigation of structural disorder and complex configurational relaxation in
              glasses and other disordered systems, subjects of intense interest in many
              fields including cryobiology, amorphous solid state electronics and the
              structure and function of proteins.  The glasses to be studied are molecular,
              with emphasis on water and other hydrogen bonding liquids.  Issue to be
              addressed include:  similarities in the initial nuclear (inertial) response of
              a glass and liquid to optical excitation of a probe (relevant to chemical
              reaction dynamics in solution); the effect of spatial confinement on the
              structure and relaxation processes of glasses; comparison of the spectral
              dynamics and electron-phonon coupling of a probe in low and high density glassy
              water; and the spectroscopic properties of probe molecules in a mammalian
              cells.  Techniques to be used are spectral hole burning (SHB) and photon echo
              spectroscopies and a novel hyperquenching apparatus for formation of
              glasses.

The challenging nature of the experiments and state-of-the-art
              equipment provide excellent educational opportunities for undergraduate and
              graduate students.  The fundamental studies of probe molecules in cells will
              help establish whether spectral hole burning can be used in early detection of
              cancer.
