Abstract    :
              This project will develop a new methodology for optimal control of cylindrical
              plunge grinding cycles.  In this type of grinding, a cycle generally consists
              of a few discrete infeed rates applied sequentially.  The consideration of a
              limited number of discrete infeed rates makes the problem tractable and allows
              the cycle to be readily implemented with older machine control techniques
              (e.g., ladder logic).  But it limits the extent of cycle-time reduction by
              optimization.  The foundation of the  methodology will be Model Predictive
              Control (MPC) where the value of infeed rate at each sampling instant is
              determined according to its projected effect on the process and part quality
              constraints.  However, the basic form of MPC will not be adequate for this
              application because of the inherent uncertainty of the grinding process.  To
              enhance its robustness, this control will be integrated with Recursive
              Constraint Bounding so as to incorporate conservatism into the optimization
              process.

The optimal control methodology is able to provide a cycle with
              continuously varying infeed rates.  This should lead to significant savings in
              cycle time and cost, as well as being more suited to implementation of the
              control with open-architecture controllers.
