Abstract    :
              Information retrieval has been viewed as an individual activity.  This project
              investigates information retrieval in collaborative situations.  It defines
              collaborative information retrieval (CIR) as any activity that collectively
              resolves an information problem taken by members of a work team, and
              investigates the manifestations of CIR in work settings.  Guided by a
              work-centered conceptual framework for the evaluation and design of information
              systems, the study follows three steps: (1) creating a model of CIR through
              field observations and analyses of information seeking behavior of four work
              teams; (2) validating and generalizing the model through a survey; and (3)
              examining technological developments and organizational changes that might
              enhance CIR.  As the first study of its kind, the project explains how
              information is acquired, shared and used in work situations.  As a result, (1)
              issues in knowledge management in organizations are addressed and (2) the
              development of technologies that support, facilitate, and enhance teamwork is
              guided.  On the theoretical side, the project extends an existing conceptual
              framework to include teamwork and thus, (1) creates a new analytical tool that
              informs other studies about CIR, and (2) enriches other conceptual constructs
              both in information retrieval and in collaborative work.
