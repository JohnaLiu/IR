This proposal requests funding for an international workshop
              to develop a Latin American component of the International Geosphere-Biosphere
              Program's new Initiative for Global Change Research in Mountain Regions, to
              take place in Papallacta, a town near the site of Ecuador's longest
              continuously running hydrological station.  Organizers are Dr. Michael McClain,
              Florida International University, and Dr. Remigio Galarraga, Chairman of the
              Department of Hydraulics and Water Resources, Ecuador's National Polytechnic
              University, Quito. The goals are to develop a strategy for detecting signals of
              global environmental change in Latin America mountain environments and define
              its consequences for mountain regions as well as for lowland systems; and to
              develop sustainable land, water and resource management strategies.   

The
              outcome of this effort should increase our understanding of the natural systems
              in the mountain areas, and aid in mitigating future devastating effects of
              storms, particularly in mountainous and remote areas, and will be broadly
              significant elsewhere in the world.
