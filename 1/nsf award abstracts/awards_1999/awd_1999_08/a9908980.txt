Abstract    :
              This grant supports the continuation of the Core Project Office of the
              International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project, an element of the
              International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). As in past years, the IGAC
              CPO is funded jointly by NSF, NASA, NOAA, and DOE. 
IGAC seeks to provide an
              international framework for planning and implementing essential scientific
              activities in atmospheric-biospheric chemistry, particularly when they require
              human, technological, or monetary resources beyond the capacity of single
              nations. IGAC also seeks to serve as a vehicle for coordination of various U.S.
              national programs with relevant national and regional programs elsewhere to
              focus attention and resources on key problems in atmospheric-biospheric
              chemistry at regional and global scales. The functions of the IGAC Core Project
              Office (CPO) include: (1) administrative support for the project leadership,
              (2) scientific development of the project, (3) communicating information about
              the project and its scientific results to the broader scientific and other
              client communities.
