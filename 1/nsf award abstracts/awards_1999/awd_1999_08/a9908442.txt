There are many important
              high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layer flows for which knowledge of the
              turbulence field statistical properties would be of significant importance to
              the designer.  The velocity field upstream of a submarine propeller and the
              approach flow forward of the tail rudder on a large aircraft are two examples. 
              Statistical differences and similarities between the largely unexplored high
              Reynolds number and the well documented laboratory scale boundary layers also
              have importance for theoretical and modeling consideration within the
              turbulence community.
