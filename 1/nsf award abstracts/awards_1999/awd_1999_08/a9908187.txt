Ceramic thermal barrier coatings offer the potential for
              improved efficiency, fuel economy, durability and performance in high
              temperature applications such as aerospace and aircraft engines, gas turbines
              and diesel engines. In these applications, the coatings are subjected to
              varying high temperatures and temperature gradients, which can ultimately
              result in delamination and spalling of the coating.
	
The presence of surface
              cracks in the coating has been shown to increase its life. Furthermore, recent
              experimental and analytical results have shown that changing the periodicity
              and length/thickness ratio of such cracks can decrease interfacial crack
              propagation in thick coatings  which are subjected to high surface temperatures
              and large temperature gradients. These results suggest that by introducing a
              periodic crack system during manufacture it should be possible to reduce
              interface cracking in service.  This opens up the possibility of using thick
              thermal barrier coatings produced by plasma spraying, which would provide
              significantly greater thermal protection and longer life under thermal loads
              and also give greater design flexibility and reduced cost of processing. Thus,
              the objectives of the proposed research are: (a) to develop an understanding of
              the response of interface cracks in thermal barrier coatings subjected to high
              heat fluxes in the presence of surface cracks introduced during the thermal
              spray process; (b) to use controlled experiments and analytical models to
              determine the effects of crack length, periodicity, thickness, combined with
              time-dependent material behavior of the coating under different thermal
              boundary conditions on the thermal fracture of the interface.
