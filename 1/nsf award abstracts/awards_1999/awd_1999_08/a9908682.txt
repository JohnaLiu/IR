Abstract    :
              The project will convene a group of people to examine the perceptions of arctic
              residents about the impact of different sea ice conditions and compare their
              observations to those of scientists who study sea ice conditions from the
              western scientific point of view.  Case studies of different sea ice conditions
              will be used to learn how the two groups of observers see the same events.  The
              use of Traditional Environmental Knowledge held by arctic residents will be
              explored by scientists to examine conditions perceived by the residents to have
              the greatest impact on them.  The results of the workshop will be used to
              develop a predictive capability to assess the impact of sea ice conditions that
              may change in response to global climate change in the Arctic.  The project is
              an important component in a study of the Human Dimensions of Global Change in
              the Arctic.
