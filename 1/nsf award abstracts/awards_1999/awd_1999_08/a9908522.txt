This award supports collaboration between Rex Lowe, Bowling
              Green University, and Barry Biggs, National Institute for Water and Atmospheric
              Research, Christchurch, New Zealand, on the biodiversity and biogeography of
              diatoms in New Zealand. The geographic isolation of New Zealand led to a
              relatively well documented unique flora and fauna.  The flora of diatoms that
              dominate benthic algal communities of most streams in New Zealand, however, is
              poorly known. The proposed research will survey the taxonomy and distribution
              in selected streams of Westland and Southwestland on New Zealand's South
              Island.  This research will not only add significantly to the knowledge base on
              global biodiversity by will also provide a firm taxonomic base for future
              research into the structure and function of southern hemisphere streams.
