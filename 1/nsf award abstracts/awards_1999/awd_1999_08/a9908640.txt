Abstract    :
              	This award provides partial travel support for graduate students and
              postdoctoral fellows to participate in the subject conference.  The objective
              of the conference is to bring together researchers with related interests in
              water vapor but who may come from different segments of the atmospheric
              sciences community.  The conference will focus on the climate system, and
              include modeling and observational scientists.  Sessions will be organized to
              promote interactions across "disciplinary" lines.  Major topics include
              cross-tropopause fluxes of water vapor;  the radiative, dynamical and chemical
              processes involving water vapor;  measurement techniques appropriate for
              climate monitoring;  and a review of current knowledge about water vapor.  The
              meeting will be structured to provide opportunities for younger scientists to
              present their work and to network.

	Support for this award is being provided
              under NSF's WEAVE Initiative of the Global Change Program.
