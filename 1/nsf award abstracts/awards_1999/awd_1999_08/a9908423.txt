This five year continuing grant funds the
              Pennsylvania State University to become a research site of the multi-university
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Glass Research. 
              The research site will be added to the existing sites at Alfred University and
              the University of Missouri Rolla.

The Pennsylvania State University research
              agenda will address 1.) Glass Surfaces and Thin Film Coatings, 2.) Adhesion of
              Polymer to Glass and 3.) Surface Protection and Strengthening of Glass.
