Abstract    :
              The El Paso Urban Systemic Program (EPUSP)-a three-district collaboration,
              including El Paso, Ysleta, and Socorro Independent  School Districts-is
              requesting support for moving its previous Urban Systemic Initiative (USI0
              Program accomplishments to the next level in order to complete the
              transformation of K-12 mathematics and science teaching and learning. 
              Consistent with its established goals, objectives, and benchmarks, EPUSP has
              described the USP Core K-12 Program and Implementation Process in terms of the
              following seven key elements: (1) Scale-up and intensify implementation of
              high-quality curriculum, instruction, assessment, and related professional
              development by reconfiguring the system of support to schools to ensure that
              more schools are at full implementation; (2) Build school and district
              organizational capacity by providing a comprehensive professional development
              program to school principals, assistant principals, deans of instructions, and
              counselors; (3) Fully align and implement district policies to USP goals by
              developing mechanisms to ensure that policies are adequately implemented and
              establishing additional policies; (4) Ensure parent and broad community
              involvement via the development of parent centers, monthly sessions with
              business and civic leaders, and enhancing the capability of museums; (5)
              Strengthen the research agenda to inform efforts aimed at the improvement of
              classroom practices and student performance; (6) Align K-16 mathematics and
              science courses to ensure a seamless set of content and learning experiences
              leading to student success in college science and mathematics; and (7) Increase
              and enhance mathematics and science teacher workforce to develop an exemplary
              teacher education program.
