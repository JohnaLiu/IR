Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of meteorological and remote sensing
              products in support of the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring
              Equinox (TOPSE) experiment. TOPSE is a multi-investigator, aircraft-based
              program designed to study the tropospheric spring ozone maximum over high
              latitude North America and the Arctic.  Characterizing changes in the
              dynamically modulated background ozone concentration in the rnid-troposphere
              will be an important component in the success of the TOPSE experiment. Where
              and how this ozone is advected will also be traced. Satellite remote-sensing
              work, in combination with detailed meteorological analyses, including
              3-dimensional visualizations of the atmosphere during flights, the production
              of detailed cross sections, and calculations of 3-dimensional back
              trajectories, form the basis of the proposed effort. This support work will be
              carried out to maximize the ability to interpret aircraft, ozonesonde, and
              surface-based chemical observations, which are the focus of TOPSE. Real-time
              meteorological products will be produced and made available on web pages in
              standard image formats and as animated loops with interpretive text. Archives
              of imagery and meteorological model fields will be developed for the duration
              of the field campaign and post-intensive analyses will be undertaken in
              collaboration with TOPSE chemists and modelers to interpret all chemical
              observations in the appropriate meteorological context.
