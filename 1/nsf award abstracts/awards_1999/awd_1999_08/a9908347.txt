Abstract    :
              Funds are provided to hold a community workshop of sedimentary geologists to
              generate a science plan for the sedimentology and stratigraphy aspects of the
              MARGINS initiative. The workshop will identify important new directions for the
              future of sedimentary research and recommend strategies for accomplishing those
              goals. Detail interdisciplinary studies will also be considered. A four-day
              meeting is planned where some 50 scientists will get together and produce a
              report for NSF and the MARGINS community.
