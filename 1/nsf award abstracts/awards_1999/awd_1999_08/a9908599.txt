Abstract    :
              The Taylor - Couette flow has been the source for important insight and
              quantitative comparisons between theory and experiment.  The proposed
              investigation is to take this classical flow (inclusive of a non-zero spatially
              averaged axial component) to a new level of contribution by providing
              controlled input pertubations whose theoretically predicted effects can be
              experimentally confirmed.  It is expected that foundational information for the
              stability and transition research community will be provided by this
              investigation.
