The sponsorship and funding of the Division of Electrical and
              Communication Systems (ECS) of NSF, is requested to partially support the ISDRS
              Symposium, December 1-3, 1999, in Charlottesville, VA. The Symposium is
              particularly encouraging student participation and provides a highly
              interactive forum for fostering students and scientists in the areas of novel
              semiconductor devices and advanced fabrication technologies. We propose to use
              the funds to partially support student participation (partial travel
              reimbursement), the Proceedings publication, administrative expenses, plenary
              speakers, and symposium officers incidental expenses. The participation and
              endorsement of NSF is invited, and a special session is planned with a panel of
              NSF and other Agency representatives to "road-map" the enabling technologies in
              the new millenium.
