Abstract    :
              Raymond B. Landis
California State University, Los Angeles

Raymond B. Landis
              is the founder and architect of the Minority Engineering Program at Cal State
              L.A., a national model for minority focused engineering initiatives,
              established over two decades ago.  He also established an innovative program to
              enhance cross-cultural communication between faculty advisors and minority
              students.  His engineering textbook for college freshmen has reached over
              32,000 students at over 300 institutions.  His newsletter provides on-going
              support for science and mathematics teachers and engineering faculty.  And, his
              Chautauqua course has disseminated his methods to over 700 engineering
              educators from across the country.   Dr. Landis was able to identify 210
              predominately minority mentees that earned engineering degrees.
