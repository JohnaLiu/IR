This award partially supports member attendance at the
              second meeting of the World Federation of NDE Centers to be held just prior to
              the Twenty-sixth Review of Progress in Quantitative Nondestructive Evaluation
              (Monteal, Canada, July 1999)

This assembly of representatives from leading
              industrial nations along with those of developing nations provides a forum for
              future research collaborations to be discussed.

The major purpose of this
              multi-regional workshop will be the delineation of plans for worldwide
              cooperative NDE research and to consider additional membership from other
              countries.
