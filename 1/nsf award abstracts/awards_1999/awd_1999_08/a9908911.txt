Abstract    :
              Basalts from mantle plumes provide fundamental information on the composition
              and history of the Earth's mantle.  The Hawaiian plume is the classic example
              of a mantle plume and its basalts are unquestionably the best studied suite
              from any plume.  The lavas of Koolau Volcano in Hawaii belong to a distinct
              compositional endmember of ocean island basalts and appear to provide the
              strong evidence for deep mantle recycling of crust (sediment and basalt),
              although this interpretation remain controversial and is based on sampling only
              the uppermost veneer of the volcano.  This proposal requests funding to obtain
              ~300 m of rock core from the base of a ~245 m deep, water observation hole. 
              The rocks from this well will extend below any surface exposures of the volcano
              and it is expected that the rocks obtained will have experienced less tropical
              weathering than surface rocks.  We will systematically describe the chips and
              cores from the well following procedures we have developed for the Hawaii
              Scientific Drilling Program and make an initial petrographic and geochemical
              characterization of the core and chips for this one year project.
