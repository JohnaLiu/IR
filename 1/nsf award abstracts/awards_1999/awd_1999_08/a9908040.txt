GARRISON

This proposal is for renewal of an I/UCRC on
              measurement and control engineering which was originally established at the
              University of Tennessee.  The present proposal outlines multi-university
              collaboration between the University of Tennessee and Oklahoma State
              University.  The existing center will be expanded by partnering with OSU which
              adds advanced process control with a focus on modeling and experimental
              computer intensive studies.  The program includes one investigator from Eastern
              Carolina University.

The current research program emphasizes two areas:
              analytical Instrumentation and process control optimization and modeling.  UTK
              faculty are involved in both research areas, whereas, OSU faculty are involved
              only in the process control optimization and modeling area.  The proposal does
              not clearly delineate changes in the research focus of the previously funded
              center that is to be accomplished by adding the OSU program.  Industrial
              involvement and membership are of high level and considered strength.
