Abstract    :
              This project of Professor Theodore Madey of Rutgers Unievsrity, sponsored by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry, supports travel and participation costs for
              graduate students and young faculty to attend the Eighth International Workshop
              on Desorption Induced by Electronic Transitions (DIET 8) to be sponsored by
              Rutgers University 27 September- 1 October 1999, and held at Long Branch, New
              Jersey.  Topics to be covered in the Workshop include basic mechanisms and
              theory, electroncally induced surface chemistry, semiconductor processing,
              ion-induced desorption, gas-phase processes such as core excitation and
              electron attachment, DIET processes in scanning probe microscopies, formation
              of negative ions at surfaces, laser-induced desorption, and desorption of
              particles from insulating and condensed layers.   

An international group of
              researchers is scheduled to attend this workshop on desorption induced by
              electronic transitions (DIET 8), with lecturers from France, Germany, Sweden,
              Japan and Canada, along with several prominent US researchers.  The DIET
              workshops are held every 2.5 years.  The last two meetings were 1997
              (Ambleside, UK) and 1994 (Krakow, Poland).  This will be the first DIET
              workshop to be held in the US in the last 7.5 years, and therefore represents a
              unique opportunity for interaction of US graduate students and young faculty
              with their colleagues from around the world.   The process of desorption from
              surfaces is central to the areas of photochemistry and semiconductor
              processing.
