Description:  This award supports the US-India Cooperative
              Research: Excavations at Gilund.  US PI Gregory Possehl, University of
              Pennsylvania will conduct joint research with Vasant Shinde of Deccan College,
              Pune.  Gilund is an early food producing and Bronze Age site located in
              Rajasthan, India.  Possehl and two graduate students will participate in the
              excavation, along with Shinde's research team from Deccan College.  The
              investigators will reconstruct a comprehensive picture of the life of the
              ancient inhabitants of Mewar region.  Archaeologists and laboratory facilities
              at Deccan College, including collections for palaeobotany and archaeozoology,
              will be used.  Indian X-ray diffraction and atomic absorption expertise and
              hardware will make it possible to complete extensive "sensing and sourcing"
              studies. 

Scope:  This research will add to the growing body of literature
              that strives to determine the distinctive qualities of Indus civilization
              sub-regions and will contribute to knowledge of archaic states.  The US and
              Indian PIs are eminently well qualified and partnerships among researchers will
              advance theoretical interests in both countries.  The collaborative nature of
              this project and the substantial financial contributions on the Indian side
              make this an ideal project for support from the Division of International
              Programs (INT).  INT and the Archaeology, Archaeometry and Systematic
              Collections Program jointly support this project.
