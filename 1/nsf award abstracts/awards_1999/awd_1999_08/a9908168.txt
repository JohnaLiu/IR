Abstract    :
              The Dallas Urban Systemic Program (DUSP) submitted by the Dallas Independent
              School District (DISD) builds on a previous Urban Systemic Initiatives (USI)
              project and plans to expand its successes and implement new initiatives to
              improve mathematics and science education for all students.  The DISD, with
              strong support from institutions and businesses, has been engaged for five
              years with the National Science Foundation to improve the teaching and learning
              of science, mathematics, and technology (SMT).  Components identified for more
              extensive deployment include: (1) K-12 standards-based SMT curriculum; 
(2)
              implementation of exemplary programs; (3) classroom accreditation standards and
              procedures;
(4) community and parental support; and (5) institutionalization
              through strengthening of the current infrastructure.  Critical new thrusts
              encompass: (1) early childhood education strategies; (2) strong minority
              participation; (3) SMT classroom measurement loop; (4) graduate student
              tutoring and mentoring; (5) K-14 job skill initiative; (6) K-16 collaboration
              with universities to improve teacher preparation programs; and (7) research
              activities with colleges, universities, and businesses.
