Abstract    :
                   The Girls Research Opportunities in Computing (Girls R.O.C.) project
              exposes girls, especially those from rural schools and minorities, to career
              opportunities in computer science.  Girls R.O.C. is targeted at girls while
              their interest in computers is high and their enthusiasm can be encouraged
              through female role models, a non-competitive environment, group research,
              evening speakers, and field trips.  In this project, middle-school girls are
              involved in a variety of classroom and hands-on activities that will expose
              them to ways that computers are used in research, business, and the home.  
  
                The project consists of two three-week summer sessions with three follow-up
              campus visits during the following school year to continue research projects. 
              Twenty-four girls will participate in each summer session for a total of 48
              participants.  Recruitment is limited to a 50-mile radius of  Northern
              Louisiana University in order to make follow-up visits feasible.  Each
              participant will be required to enter her research project in a local science
              fair.
     The project is led by three female project directors with the
              assistance of six female undergraduate computer science majors.  The
              participants and the undergraduate assistants will live on campus during the
              three-week sessions.
