Abstract    :
              The Antarctic Meteorological Research Center (AMRC), one of three research
              centers in the Science and Engineering Technology Center at McMurdo, is a
              resource for meteorological research and a test bed for improving operational
              synoptic forecasting.  The Man-Computer Interactive Data Access System
              (McIDAS), a versatile computer-based system developed by the University of
              Wisconsin for organizing, manipulating, and integrating environmental data
              forms the basis of AMRC.  It captures the flow of antarctic meteorological
              information from polar orbiting satellites, automatic weather stations,
              operational station synoptic observations, and research project data.  It also
              receives environmental data products, such as weather forecasts, from outside
              Antarctica, and acts as a repository for existing archived data bases.

The
              AMRC was established in the 1992-93 austral summer season and consisted of the
              installation and operation of work stations capable of manipulating and
              displaying Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data based on the
              existing satellite imagery acquisition system.  This was followed by the
              acquisition and integration of a system that provided data collection, data
              display and archiving, scientific applications, network communications, and
              remote user access.  

The system currently produces the Antarctic Composite
              Infrared Image (ACII), a mosaic of images from four geostationary and three
              polar-orbiting satellites, which is used for both forecasting and research
              purposes.  The current phase maintains continuity of product generation and
              user support.
