This proposal is for a planning visit to Mongolia by Dr.
              Marion Hansen, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.  Dr. Hansen
              proposes to develop a cooperative research project between the U.S. and
              Mongolia to implement and improve the production and application of high
              performance concrete.  This visit is a continuation of the 1998 NSF workshop
              funded by the Division of International Programs on high performance concrete
              (HPC) and is directed toward the development and implementation of the
              research, production, and education efforts on HPC between the South Dakota
              School of Mines and Technology and the Mongolia Technological University.
