This US-Mexico award will support Prof. Raymond A. Young of
              the University of Wisconsin-Madison in a research collaboration with Dr. Juan
              Ramos of the University of Guadalajara, Mexico, to work on the use of cold
              plasmas to modify common polymer surfaces and to use such surfaces for enzyme
              immobilization. 

Preliminary studies in the area of enzyme immobilization
              reactions from cold-plasma substrates demonstrate the viability of a
              cold-plasma approach for the development of advanced molecular recognition and
              machining technologies, useful in the biotech industry among others.  These
              interdisciplinary efforts may play a significant role in the advanced
              technologies of the 21st century. The proposed research blends complementary
              skills on both sides in research of mutual benefit: the Mexican side providing
              a strong background in plasma chemistry and in the modification and
              characterization of natural polymers, while the group at the University of
              Wisconsin Center for Plasma-Aided Manufacturing and the Department of Forestry,
              has extensive experience and facilities in the area of surface modification of
              natural and synthetic polymeric substrates.
