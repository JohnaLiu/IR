Abstract    :
              Richard L. Radtke
University of Hawaii at Manoa

Dr. Radtke effectively
              balances his time between scientific research and community/youth education in
              a highly productive way.  He engages students, parents and teachers in his
              laboratory, in the field, in his global expeditions and in countless civic
              presentations, schools visits and public television programs.  Dr. Radtke works
              with a diverse student body including undergraduate and graduate students.  He
              has mentored more than eighty youths with physical disabilities.  He has
              inspired blind youth to paddle canoes; youth with mental health needs to
              control their emotions; and Deaf students to share their observations in
              American Sign Language. Dr. Radtke is an outstanding role model, particularly
              for physically disabled youth, since he too is severely disabled due to
              multiple sclerosis and has been paralyzed from the neck down since the mid
              1980's.
