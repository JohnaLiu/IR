This US-Argentina dissertation enhancement research proposal was
              submitted by Ms. Pilar E. Garcia, University of Arizona, under the sponsorship
              of Dr. George H. Davis.  Ms. Garcia will work with Dr. Ernesto Cristallini of
              the Universidad de Buenos Aires in Argentina.  She will be doing a detailed
              study of a well-exposed range in the Sierras Pampeanas of Northwest Argentina,
              to increase our understanding of the formation of basement-cored uplift
              mountain ranges.
Basement-cored uplifts are irregular tectonic products
              because they occur several hundred kilometers from active plate margins where
              most mountains are usually formed, and because they involve brittle faulting
              and folding of continental, crystalline rocks at shallow levels within the
              crust.  This anomalous nature of these uplifts makes their kinematics and
              dynamics of formation poorly understood.  The chosen site is important because
              it has exposure of the basement-cover contact, which will permit observation at
              a critical interface.  A better understanding of the structure of these ranges
              is critical to evaluate the formation of these tectonic elements and may lead
              to useful geometric and kinematic models.  The understanding of foreland
              basement uplifts is a significant problem in structural geology.
