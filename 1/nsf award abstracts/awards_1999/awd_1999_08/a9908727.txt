This US-Brazil award will provide support for Drs. Man-Yee B.
              Tsang and William G. Lynch of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory
              (NSCL) at Michigan State University to collaborate with colleagues at Brazil's
              Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, led by Dr. Raul Donangelo.  Their goal is
              to study the theoretical interpretation of nuclear multifragmentation, a
              process that may provide insight into the liquid-gas phase transition of
              nuclear matter.
This collaboration will bring experimentalists from Michigan
              State to work with theoreticians from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
               Dr. Donangelo is one of the original developers of the widely used Statistical
              Multifragmentation Model (SMM).  The group at NSCL possesses a unique set of
              multifragmentation data that requires significant improvements to the SMM and
              other models for its interpretation.  So far, the two groups have focussed on
              these improvements, which could make the model capable of accurate statistical
              predictions of isotopic yields.  When the groups meet at NSCL, they will work
              on comparisons to the large volume of data they have accumulated, while in Rio
              the emphasis will be on model developments.
