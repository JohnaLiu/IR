Abstract    :
              ATM9908653abs

SRI International will continue operating an atmospheric
              observing facility at Resolute Bay, Northwest Territories, Canada, and to
              conduct and coordinate scientific research efforts in association with the
              observations.  SRI constructed the observatory and has operated it for the past
              six years under combined support from the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) and
              the Division of Atmospheric Sciences (ATM).  It currently houses seven
              different instruments that routinely make measurements of atmospheric
              properties from the mesosphere through the thermosphere.  SRI will operate and
              maintain the basic physical plant, operate a Frequency Agile Radar and imagers
              on a campaign basis, assist in operating and maintaining guest instruments,
              help investigators plan and conduct experiments, and act as the official
              liaison to the Government of the Territory of Nunavut.  The project will foster
              the education of future polar scientists and provide a test bed for new
              techniques for polar atmospheric monitoring.  Phenomena to be studied include
              polar cap arcs and patches, polar mesospheric summer echoes, and auroral and
              tidal forcing on the neutral atmosphere.   The next few year of operation will
              be exceptionally fruitful due to the rising level of solar activity.  Funding
              for the infrastructure, operations, and scientific research will continue to be
              shared between OPP and ATM.
