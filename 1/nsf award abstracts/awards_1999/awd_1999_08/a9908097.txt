Abstract    :
              Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are tiny pressure
              transducers,
accelerometers, etc. having features as small as 1 micrometer and
              fabricated
from vapor-deposited polycrystalline silicon and similar materials.
              The first
objective of this research is to develop techniques and procedures
              for
tensile testing of these materials in order to determine whether the size
              of the
specimen and the complexity of the stress affect their properties.
              The
second objective is to develop new test methods to cycle tiny specimens
              in
tension and measure their response to cyclic loading. Material properties
              of these new structural materials are required for intelligent design and life
              prediction of novel microdevices.***
