Title: The Impact of Snow Anomalies on Interannual Northern
              Hemisphere Climate Variability

The proposed work aims at establishing the
              snow cover and land surface forcing link to seasonal-interannual climate
              variability in the Northern Hemisphere. A conceptual model will be developed
              based on land-atmosphere interactions that will explain a significant portion
              of the climate variability associated with such modes of the atmosphere as the
              North Atlantic Oscillation. The ways in which the conceptual model could serve
              as the basis for a seasonal to an interannual forecast system will be
              investigated. The work is important because it will yield improved
              understanding of the role of snow in climate.
