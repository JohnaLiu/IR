The Space Science Institute will present Earth System
              Science (ESS) in a new project called "InterActive Earth," which includes a
              6,000-square foot traveling exhibition and a comprehensive education program. 
              Earth System Science is a holistic study of the Earth that concentrates on the
              interactions between Earth's various subsystems and how natural and
              human-induced changes affect Earth on a global scale.  The planning grant will
              allow exhibit developers to conduct front-end evaluation to uncover visitors'
              misconceptions about ESS and identify their interests.  It will also allow for
              the development of the overall conceptual framework for the project and the
              approach to exhibition design.
