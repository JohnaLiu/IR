This US-Argentina collaborative research project will support
              Dr. F. Alberto Grunbaum of the University of California, Berkeley to work with
              Professor Juan Tirao at the Universidad de Cordoba in Argentina.  The
              researchers will investigate the theory of "special functions" of the
              nontrivial type to obtain explicit expressions for these functions and to look
              for possible applications of these new tools both in traditional as well as
              newer aspects of science and engineering.  In particular, a theory of matrix
              valued spherical functions will be developed. 

This project is one in which
              the complementary expertise of both investigators will be used in every aspect
              of the proposed work.  The Argentinean team has concentrated on the theory,
              while the U.S. researchers are adept at applying theory to practical problems. 
              Potential applications are wide-ranging, in areas such as computerized
              tomography, electrical engineering and coding theory.
