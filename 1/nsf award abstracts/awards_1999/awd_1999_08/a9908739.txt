This is a CEDAR Post Doc Research project
              proposed for Zhilin Hu to study atmospheric tidal and mean-value climatology of
              temperature and winds in the menopause region over Fort Collins, CO (410 N,
              1050W).  The new data necessary for this study will be taken in a number of
              campaigns during the proposed two-year period to be organized by the Post Doc
              candidate with the help of one Colorado State graduate student.  The newly
              upgraded two-beam narrowband Na lidar, capable of simultaneous temperature and
              wind measurements (in addition to Na density) in both daytime and nightime, is
              essential and will be scheduled for the use of the proposed study.  The data
              set obtained will be analyzed by the Post Doc candidate and compared to model
              results such as NCAR's TIMED-GCM and GSWM with theoretical guidance from Maura
              Hagan and Ray Roble of NCAR.
