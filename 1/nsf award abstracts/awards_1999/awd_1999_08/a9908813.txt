This US-Mexico award will support a regional workshop on the
              ecology and conservation of neotropical birds in conjunction with the VI
              Neotropical Ornithological Congress to take place in Monterrey, Mexico.  The
              objectives of the workshop are to facilitate communication among researchers
              and managers from the United States and Latin America; to consolidate existing
              information about ducks, geese, and swans in the neotropics; and to stimulate
              conservation and further research of this little-studied group of birds.
              Because neotropical waterfowl have evolved in a different ecological context
              than their temperate counterparts, different social systems and breeding
              strategies have arisen.  Study of these differences can contribute to the field
              of behavioral ecology and evolution.

The workshop, organized in response to
              the lack of a comprehensive source of current information on neotropical
              migrants and residents of the family Anatidae and from a desire to develop an
              improved communication network of local and foreign scientists working with
              neotropical waterfowl in Latin America, will be divided into two sessions
              dealing with ecology, behavior, evolution, and natural history and two other
              sessions dealing with conservation and management.  A combination of small and
              large group discussions will produce a draft of suggested research and
              conservation actions that will be included in the workshop proceedings in order
              to provide guidelines for future work.
