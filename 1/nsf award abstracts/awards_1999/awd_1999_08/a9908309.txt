Abstract    :
              This project involves the encouraging leading U.S. academic researchers to
              participate inthe International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) 1999
              Congress.  This proposal stresses and emphasis on using the proposed travel
              grants to promote involvement of junior faculty and graduate students with a
              clear intention to pursue a career in academic/higher education.  The IFAC
              Congress is held only every three years since 1960.  This Congress provides a
              unique opportunity for internationalexchangr of ideas, as at national Control
              conferences typically 70% of the technical papers are contributed by US
              researchers, compared with only 11% at this congress.  This year's congress,
              which is being held in Beijing China, provides a unique forum for the
              international control community to review the impact of automation during the
              past century and to look forward to needs and developments for the century to
              come.
