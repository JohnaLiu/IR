Abstract    :
                   This grant provides funding to advance the state of the art in optimal
              control of non-stationary systems. Specifically, the objective of this research
              is to develop optimal admission and optimal pricing policies
for finite
              capacity, non-stationary queueing systems with multiple customer classes
              offering different amounts of reward to obtain service. These types of queueing
              models arise in many applications such as production systems, communications
              systems, and airline industry.  The research will involve the
following tasks.
              First, systems where parameters such as rewards, system capacity, arrival
              rates, and service rates change only once at a known time, will be considered.
              Insights gained from the structure of optimal policies in these simple
              non-stationary systems will facilitate the analysis of the systems where
              changes occur periodically.  Finally, numerical algorithms will be developed to
              compute the parameters
of optimal policies.
     A major contribution
              anticipated from this research is the development of a fundamental science base
              required for optimal decision making in non-stationary environments. Towards
              this end, new optimality criteria for non-stationary systems will be defined.
              The educational impact of the proposed research will be in the form of
              classroom instruction, PhD student research, seminars and conferences.
