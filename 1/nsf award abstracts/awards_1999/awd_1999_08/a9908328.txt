Abstract    :
              This award is a standard grant to support two years of research at the
              Integrated Media Systems Center, and Engineering Research Center, at the
              University of Southern California for use of immersive audio and video for
              education of both engineers and students in cinema.  The goal is to create a
              paradigm for immersive technology-enabled engineering education that shifts the
              emphasis form passive lectures to student-centered learning through
              cross-disciplinary peer interaction.  The research team has expertise in
              immersive audio signal processing, psychoacoustics, high-bandwidth networks,
              systems integration, human-computer interaction, and learning and cognitive
              science.  The collaborative team includes Integrated Media Systems Center,
              University of Southern California School of Cinema and Television, and the SRI
              Center for Technology.  The program focuses on learning research and the ways
              that innovative uses of technologies can help address issues and teaching.
