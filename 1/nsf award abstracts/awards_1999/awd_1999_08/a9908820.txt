The Materials Technology committee of Vision 2020 is
              conducting a second workshop on Sept. 31-Oct. 1 at Golden, CO.  The specific
              workshop topics to be discussed are: Modeling and Prediction of Material
              Properties; New Materials; and Additives.  Vision 2020 is an effort involving
              academic, industrial and government laboratories to define the mission and
              establish technical priorities to improve the competitiveness of the chemical
              industry, to develop increased cooperation between industry, academia and the
              government, and to provide direction for research funding for the next several
              decades.  The specific output of the first workshop and this workshop will be a
              roadmap with specific recommendations on achieving the above stated goals in
              the area of Materials Technology.

This should be a valuable document for
              government agencies sponsoring materials research and will represent a
              cooperative effort of all interested parties: industry, academe and
              government.
