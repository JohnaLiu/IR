The Association of American State Geologists will conduct a
              two-year program to provide undergraduate students in geoscience with
              field-oriented research experiences.  The objectives of the program are to have
              the nation's state geological surveys better train students to scientific field
              techniques and geologic mapping and to excite and encourage students to work in
              the field, side by side with experienced geologic mappers and field geologists,
              who will be both teachers and mentors.  The success of the program will be
              assessed by interviewing students and their teacher/mentors and tracking the
              students' careers.  These compiled data will be reported to the general
              geoscience community.  Individual state surveys will select students from
              geoscience departments and summer field camp programs nationwide and from the
              summer field-training program administered by the National Association of
              Geoscience Teachers.  It is expected that most state field projects will be
              linked to funded research through the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping
              Program (in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey) or other federal,
              state, local agencies or the private sector programs
