Abstract    :
                   This Small Grant for Exploratory Researh (SGER) project will investigate
              the feasibility of a new approach to micromanipulation using artificial muscles
              fabricated by a new material called Ionic Polymeric (polyelectrolyte) Platinum
              Composites (IPPC).  The approach in this exploratory study is to build a
              simple, parallel jaw gripper of very small dimensions (e.g. 50 microns) using
              the IPPC material, and attach this microgripper to a simple x-y table used to
              manipulate LIGA microgears of various geometries.  The research will be
              performed in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories.
     The
              microgripper system has the potential of becoming a significant enabling
              technology for economic assembly of MEMS and micromachines. The project effort
              is expected to accelerate this capability for this challenging assembly
              process.
