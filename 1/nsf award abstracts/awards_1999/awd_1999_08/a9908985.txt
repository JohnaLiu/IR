This award provides funds to the Scientific Committee on Oceanic
              Research (SCOR) for a long-standing program of travel assistance to qualified
              and active oceanographic researchers from developing countries and nations with
              economies in transition. SCOR travel grants are awarded to enable such
              individuals to attend international meetings relevant to their scientific
              interests and to those of SCOR and the Division of Ocean Sciences of NSF.  This
              ongoing project has become the cornerstone of SCOR's efforts to provide
              assistance to marine scientists in the third world and, more recently in Russia
              and Eastern Europe.  All recipients of funds are informed that this assistance
              is made possible through a grant to SCOR from the US National Science
              Foundation. Project objectives include: broadening traditional participation in
              ocean-related international scientific meetings to include more scientists from
              developing countries; enhancing the exchange of detailed regional knowledge or
              expertise in planning for large-scale oceanographic experiments; and providing
              greater opportunities leading to the involvement of developing countries in
              international collaborative programs, such as JGOFS and GLOBEC.
