Description:  This award supports the US-India Cooperative
              Research: Role of Interface in Magnetic Interaction and Spin Polarized
              Tunneling.   Collaborators are Jagadeesh Moodera of the Francis Bitter Magnet
              Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ratnamala Chatterjee,
              Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.  This research will use controlled
              radiation damage to study the influence of defects on spin dependent transport.
               The study will fill a major gap in the understanding of the role of defect
              scattering in producing giant magnetorresistance in metallic multilayers and
              magnetic tunnel junctions.  In addition to obtaining fundamental knowledge in
              incompletely understood areas of magnetism, it can lead to better magnetic
              materials for application.

Scope:  The US PI is an acknowledged leader in
              thin film magnetism, superconductivity and tunneling research.  His work has
              frequently lead to discovery.  Moodera won the IBM Research Partnership Award
              for three consecutive years.  The Indian co-PI did postdoctoral studies at MIT
              and has received numerous awards for research and teaching.  The project brings
              together complimentary expertise, facilities and involves students at both
              institutions.
