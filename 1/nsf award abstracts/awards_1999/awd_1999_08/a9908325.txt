Abstract    :
              This project will design, build, and test a novel fast-tool servomechanism for
              nanometer-resolution diamond turning of large-amplitude asymmetric surfaces. 
              It is motivated by the increasing need for optical surfaces with no axis of
              rotational symmetry.  Examples of this type of surface include spectacle and
              contact lenses, human lens implants, elements for laser eye surgery, and
              components in consumer and professional cameras, as well as image-train
              elements in devices such as semiconductor photolithographic steppers and
              scanners, laser printers, and other image processing equipment.  At present,
              elements with low-amplitude asymmetry (< 500 micrometers) can be fabricated on
              commercially available machines using a piezoelectrically driven fast tool
              servo. However, no device existing at present can achieve significantly larger
              stroke lengths along with the necessary accelerations and positioning accuracy
              to fabricate as-cut functional optics with significant asymmetry. 

If
              successful, the project result will fill the significant gap in current
              manufacturing capabilities and allow the economical production of a wide
              variety of novel optical systems.
