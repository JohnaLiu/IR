Abstract    :
              In this Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)
              collaborative program, funding is provided to develop laser-assisted solid
              freeform fabrication (SFF) for dental restoration.  It is anticipated that with
              SFF technology a dental restoration can be built in about one hour from a
              computer model without part-specific tooling and human intervention.  As such,
              the labor cost of the dental restoration will be substantially reduced, while a
              better and faster service can be provided.  The eventual goal is to provide SFF
              facilities as on-line stations for remote fabrication.

A multi-disciplinary
              team containing university and industry researchers with all the requisite
              expertise, experience and facilities has been formed for this program.  Issues
              related to SFF of dental restorations will be solved via an integrated
              theoretical and experimental approach so that dental restorations that meet the
              structural, functional and aesthetic requirements can be fabricated in a
              reproducible, precise and economic fashion.
