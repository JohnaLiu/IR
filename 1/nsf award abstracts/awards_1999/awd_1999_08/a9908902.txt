Abstract    :
              The project is developing a core data collection and reporting system for the
              NSF Collaboratives for Excellence in Teacher Preparation program.  the
              development is in three phases:  year one, focuses on consensus building, and
              device and process development and pilot testing; the second phase concentrates
              on field testing and evaluation of devices and processes; and the third phase
              concentrates on scaling up the process.  The project builds on prior work with
              the CETPs, Horizon Research's Local Systemic Change data collection mechanisms
              (participially its web based design) the experience of current CETP site
              evaluators.  The web based data collection, enables data input from many remote
              sites into a common data base, accessible for the development of reports
              containing data from all sites overall as well as for reports containing data
              from individual sites.  The database is compatible with existing NSF databases,
              as appropriate and provides impact information in a standardized and easily
              accessible format.
