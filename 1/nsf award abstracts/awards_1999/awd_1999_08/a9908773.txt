This US-Mexico award will support Professor Robert Douglas
              and Donn Gorsline of the University of Southern California (USC) in a research
              collaboration with Drs. Enrique Nava-Sanchez and Janette Murillo-Jimenez at
              CICIMAR/IPN and Dr. Adolfo Monia-Cruz at the National Autonoma University of
              Mexico.  The researchers intend to build on previous work by other
              investigators and the group at USC to examine annual to millennial cycles
              recorded in dysaerobic to anaerobic sediment deposits preserved in slope and
              margin basins of the western Gulf of California from Santa Rosalia south to La
              Paz.  This research initiative arises from the increasing interest of the past
              two decades in global climate change and the search for high-resolution records
              of such changes.

By studying change in productivity or in water mass
              characteristics and position, the investigator aims to define the effects of
              the major factors both across the Gulf and along the Gulf axis following the
              major productivity gradients.  These records are critical in defining the
              variations in ocean-climate interactive and to test models for climate
              prediction.  In addition to the collaborative work between the investigators,
              this project will support thesis and dissertation work by students from Mexico
              and the United States.
