The Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Centers (I/UCRC) Program supports researchers at undergraduate or
              predominantly undergraduate institutions to participate in the research program
              of an I/UCRC through a project that fits with the center's goals.  This allows
              students at the undergraduate institutions to work on an industrially relevant
              research project.  Two investigators from Baylor University have proposed a
              project in conjunction with the I/UCRC for Air Conditioning and Refrigeration
              at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  This project will (1)
              analyze local heat transfer behavior in both louvered-fin and offset strip fin
              arrays and (2) quantify the effects of an increase in turbulence intensity on
              heat transfer and pressure drop for these geometries.
