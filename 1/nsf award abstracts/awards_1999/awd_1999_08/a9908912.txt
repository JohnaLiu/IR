The objective is to
              investigate the viscous flow of colloidal ferrofluids and their particular
              behavior near solid walls in the presence of magnetic fields.  The connection
              between the ferrofluid nanostructure and macroscopic flow and heat transfer
              characteristics will be investigated using a combination of experimental,
              modeling and numerical simulation techniques.  A newly designed scanning
              nanorheometer, a surface force apparatus, near-field optical microscopy,
              magnetic scanning force microscopy and Doppler velocimetry will be used to
              obtain experimental information at several length scales.   Surfaces will be
              chemically and structurally modified in order to study their effects on
              adhesion and viscosity near solid walls.  Molecular simulations of particle
              dynamics and their agglomeration will be included in the macroscopic numerical
              simulations via constitutive relationships.  Finite element three-dimensional
              simulation of flow and heat transfer in ferrofluids will be tested for
              realistic situations.  This is a collaborative university-industry (GOALI)
              proposal involving Exxon R&D and Energy International, Inc.  If successful, the
              project will develop fundamental understanding and predictive methods for the
              application of ferrofluids in industrial installations, with immediate
              relevance in cooling systems in transformers and motors.
