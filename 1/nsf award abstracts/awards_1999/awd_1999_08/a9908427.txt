Support for this project will enable Mr. Dale Karlson, a
              Ph.D. candidate with Dr. Edward Ashworth, Department of Horticulture and
              Landscape Architecture, Purdue University, to conduct dissertation research in
              the laboratory of Dr. Takao Itoh, Wood Research Institute, Kyoto University,
              Japan.  The researchers will work to understand the molecular aspects of
              extreme cold hardiness in plants.  The objective of the project is to
              characterize the location of a 24 kDa dehydrin-like xylem protein, using
              immunolocalization, to ascertain its potential functional roles for enhancement
              of freezing tolerance during cold acclimation in the red osier dogwood (C.
              sericea).  

Survival of low temperature stress is a major limiting factor of
              plant distribution and productivity.  C. Sericea is one of the most freeze
              tolerant plant species.   Investigations concerning the accumulation of cold
              acclimation related proteins in this species would potentially provide insight
              on specific molecular characteristics unique to extremely tolerant organisms. 
              Such insight would increase understanding of the complex trait of freeze
              tolerance, with important implications for agriculture.  This project will
              benefit from the complementary strengths of the two laboratories.  In
              particular, the graduate student will benefit from Dr. Itoh's unique expertise
              in ultra-microtomy of woody plant tissue.
