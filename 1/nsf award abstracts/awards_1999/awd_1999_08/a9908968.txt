Abstract    :
              Ensemble Forecasting is a technique under development at a number of
              laboratories and
universities to try to deal with the fact that different
              forecast models with different strengths and weaknesses and different initial
              assumptions, pararneterizations, etc., give different results.  The ensemble
              forecast is a sort-of average of all the individual forecasts by different
              models.
Verification studies have shown that ensemble forecasts can be better
              than any of the individual forecasts within the ensemble.

This research will
              undertake to improve the reliability of ensemble forecasts of precipitation 12
              to 36 hours in advance of its occurrence by addressing the issue of optimal
              configurations of mixed ensemble prediction systems for mesoscale limited-area
              models.  This program of study will examine the sensitivity of model forecasts
              to variations in boundary layer and cumulus parameterizations as well as
              stochastic perturbations.  The examination will involve multiple cases (between
              30 and 60 per season) of mesoscale model forecasts at a horizontal grid spacing
              near 30 km for the cool and the warm seasons to allow for a rigorous
              statistical assessment of error growth characteristics and ensemble
              performance.

This research is important because it will lead to better
              estimates of predictability limits for precipitation and provide guidance on
              how to construct optimum mesoscale ensemble prediction systems to improve
              operational forecasts of precipitation with limited computational
              resources.
