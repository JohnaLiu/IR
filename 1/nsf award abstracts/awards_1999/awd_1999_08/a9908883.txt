Abstract    :
              Rossby waves play a major role in the motions that determine the Earth's general
              atmospheric circulation and weather patterns, but many aspects of Rossby-wave
              dynamics are still poorly understood.  Under this award, Dr. Magnusdottir will
              explore how regions of Rossby wave breaking, where potential vorticity is mixed
              and nonlinear processes must be taken into account, affect the basic flow.  
              While the emphasis will be on the upper troposphere in the lower latitudes, the
              stratosphere and stratosphere-troposphere interactions will be considered as
              well.  In particular, the roles of the Hadley circulation on Rossby wave
              propagation and breaking and of Rossby wave drag will be examined.  The study
              will employ a hierarchy of models, from simple theoretical models to complex
              general circulation models.

In addition, the principal investigator will
              examine the dynamical influence of the stratosphere on tropospheric flow will
              be examined with a numerical model.  Recent work suggests the stratosphere may
              have a more significant influence on short time scales than previously thought.
               Finally, as time permits, Dr. Magnusdottir will expand upon some preliminary
              work looking at the effect of higher sea surface temperatures on the
              atmospheric circulation at low latitudes.
