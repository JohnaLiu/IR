Abstract    :
              This award provides funding in partial support of acquisition of equipment to
              upgrade the network infrastructure of the Integrated Media Systems Engineering
              Research Center (IMSC) at the University of Southern California from the
              existing local area network to a wide area network.  The equipment is being
              used to establish a new telepresence laboratory, improve the performance and
              lower the cost of realistic, textured, animated rendering and avatar data
              extraction for telepresence applications to support multimedia research.  The
              equipment includes ATM Network hardware upgrades and connections to the Next
              Generation Internet, real-time encoders/decoders for full D1-rate video
              compression, high performance graphics workstations, network attached storage,
              wireless ultra-wideband impulse radio transceivers, and 3D immersive display an
              eye human-computer interface devices.  The facilities will enable more than 25
              faculty and staff and more than 100 students to attack the hardware and
              software barriers that limit the creation, dissemination, and access to
              multimedia information.  The equipment will support multidisciplinary research
              and education in the process of solving cutting-edge systems-level problems
              that require final solution assessment by design, simulation, and
              implementation.
