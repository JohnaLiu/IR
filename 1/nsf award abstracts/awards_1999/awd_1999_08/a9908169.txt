Abstract    :
              This project is to investigate the surface conditioning of
              Micro-electromechanical systems to produce an anti-stiction coating necessary
              for both the manufacturing of such devices (release) and for the performance of
              these systems.  This research is directed towards a simpler and lower cost
              method of reducing stiction (atom to atom adherence) in the self-assembled
              mono-layer (SAMS) processing.  This requires a fundamental study of the surface
              complexity, the chemistry during surface oxidation, etching, and the SAM
              formation steps of the processing sequence.  While this is wet-chemistry based,
              the surface morphologies and subsequent performance are dictated by all steps
              of the process.  The consideration for waste-reduction schemes will investigate
              means of substitution for toxic solvent chemistries and reduction of water and
              solvent usage.

This research aims to make this process manufacturable, by
              determining critical process variables and control limits and by adding sensors
              for tight process control.  Strategies aiming to achieve process
              simplification, automation, and chemical waste reduction will also be a part of
              this project.
