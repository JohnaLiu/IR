Abstract    :
              The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) will host a regional conference,
              Shaping the Future, for North Central Texas.  The conference builds on the
              success of the initiatives of the School-to-Work grants to the College of
              Science at UTA.   Other partnering universities are The University of Texas at
              Austin, The University of Texas at El Paso, and Texas A&M University.  Included
              in the conference are representatives of local school districts, junior
              colleges, and industry.  The conference focuses on four areas of science,
              mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) education.  These are
              preparation for careers in SMET, using collaborations in the design of academic
              programs, stimulating cooperation across institutional boundaries, and
              effectively integrating technology into each level of curricula.
