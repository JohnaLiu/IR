The Irish Midlands is a world-class base metal district.  This
              project seeks to understanding of the source and pathways for the hydrothermal
              fluids responsible for the formation of the Zn-Pb deposits. The proposed study
              will examine the petrology of the Upper Devonian age Old Red Sandstone, which
              underlies the carbonate rocks hosting the deposits, throughout the Irish
              Midlands. The study will determine the nature and distribution of hydrothermal
              alteration and attempt to discover the porosity of the sediments at the time of
              hydrothermal alteration through detailed petrography, isotopic (C, O, Sr),
              mineralogical, and fluid inclusion studies.  The project will also involve
              dating of diagenetic and hydrothermal micas., expanding upon a pilot 40Ar-39Ar
              geochronology of hydrothermal potassium-rich silicates (illite, muscovite). 
              The results should indicate whether fluid flow in the Old Red Sandstone was of
              regional extent or the result of flow from point sources and help significantly
              to determine whether mineralization in the district is due to lateral
              topographic-driven flow or vertical extension-driven convection.
