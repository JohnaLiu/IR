Abstract    :
                   This grant funds a study by the National Academy of Sciences that will
              examine engineering design practice and education.  In particular, it will
              compare and critique existing methods of design such as Quality Function
              Deployment, the Pugh matrix method, the Analytical Hierarchy Process and
              Axiomatic Design with the emerging decision sciences based Decision-Based
              Design methods.  A panel of experts will be convened to consider these issues
              and make recommendations for engineering design practice and education.  The
              panel of experts will include people whose expertise spans engineering design
              and support disciplines such as mathematics, probability theory, operations
              research, economics and the decision sciences.
     This study is expected to
              provide results that will help guide both practicing engineers and engineering
              educators.  For practicing design engineers, it will provide a critique of
              design methods and raise issues of relevance and rigor, and point to possible
              pitfalls in some of the methods.  For engineering design educators, it will
              provide guidelines for curriculum development, particularly in the area of
              engineering design.
