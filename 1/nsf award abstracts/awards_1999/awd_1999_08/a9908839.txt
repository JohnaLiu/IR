This award supports sixteen participants to attend the
              Conference on Emerging Global Electronic Distance Learning in Tampere, Finland,
              August 9-13, 1999.  Distance education is often not readily available to those
              who could benefit from it most (such as those in developing countries and rural
              areas in the United States).  This conference/workshop will bring together
              decision-makers from under-served countries and leaders in distance learning
              and telemedicine to discuss practical solutions for implementing affordable
              global electronic distance learning across national boundaries.  The goals of
              the workshop are to promote affordable distance education, increase
              cross-cultural understanding, promote sustainability, identify pilot
              cooperative research projects, and discuss standardization and curriculum
              development.
