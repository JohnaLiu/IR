This symposium, "Nanomechanics of Surfaces and Interfaces,"
              brings together scientists and engineers that have an interest in the structure
              and evolution of surfaces, thin-film deposition and growth, surface and
              grain-boundary diffusion, and nanoindentation. The symposium takes place at the
              University of Texas at Austin on October 25-27, 1999, and is part of the 36th
              annual technical Meeting of the Society of Engineering Science.  
The
              symposium presents an opportunity for materials scientists, engineers,
              physicists, and applied mathematicians to present their recent work, exchange
              ideas, and plan collaborative research.  The meeting offers a valuable
              experience for graduate students as it provides them an exposure to a much
              wider research framework than found in their individual research projects.
              
%%%
Over the past several years a large number of engineers and scientists
              in industry and academia have been focusing on a new set of materials-related
              problems at the nanoscale level.  Technological requirements for very small
              devices and micromachines together with substantial progress in materials
              science and computer hardware/software have opened new horizons in the study of
              materials at the nanoscale.
