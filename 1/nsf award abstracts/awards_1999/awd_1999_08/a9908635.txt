The objective of the 3rd IWFIPT is to examine the push and pull
              between microelectronics technology and emerging application areas to obtain a
              sense of future technology trends and capabilities. Leading contributors will
              describe their views on hardware performance and functionalities needed in the
              information society of the future. These projections will be juxtaposed with
              anticipated trends in microelectronics and with potential "radical
              "technologies arising from advances in carbon-based materials, quantum physics,
              molecular nanotechnology and other areas. A synthesis of views is planned to
              identify trend feeding, trend fighting and trend setting microelectronic
              technologies that are likely to emerge over the next few decades.
