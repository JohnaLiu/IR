Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop an advanced measuring system that is
              capable of high-precision/high-speed measurement of six-degree-of-freedom
              motion.  This measuring system is characterized by an integrated use of
              high-resolution interferometric system, advanced computational algorithms,
              real-time computational software, and the associated electronics.  In order to
              accomplish the goal of the project, three research objectives and one
              development objective are identified:  (1) design and implementation of
              interferometric systems,  (2) analysis and calibration of metrology alignment,
              (3) development of real-time computational algorithms for information
              integration, and  (4) implementation of real-time electronics and system
              integration.  The measuring system will be integrated with a magnetic
              suspension actuator to facilitate the necessary feedback control of the
              actuator and to illustrate the desired characteristics of the measuring system
              in terms of precision and speed.  

This project is expected to impact on the
              general areas of sensor technology, coordinate metrology, precision motion
              control, and nano-fabrications.  The developed measuring system can be
              integrated with other equipment to form new measuring tools and high precision
              machinery.
