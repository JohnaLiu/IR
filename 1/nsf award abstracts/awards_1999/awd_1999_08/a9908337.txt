Abstract    :
              This project is based on applying a new theory of surface geometry to sheet
              forming processes.  The geometric theory generates three-dimensional surfaces
              with variously shaped facets arranged and connected in a repeating array.  The
              theory is unique in that the generated surfaces can be produced from sheet
              material in a strictly folding process.  This research is to investigate the
              folding of different sheet materials to meet the generated surface
              arrangements, and the effect of pattern selection on the surfaces' physical
              properties.  These properties include crush resistance, flexibility/rigidity,
              shock absorption, and the truss strength in a laminated panel.  For instance in
              the laminated panel, many of the patterns out-perform honeycomb. 
              

Applications can be varied and extensive in areas such as corrugated boxes,
              packaging materials, highway barrier cushions, sound baffles, padding material
              for shoes, a replacement for particle board, prefabricated floor, roof and wall
              panels for buildings, safer automobile doors, composite bridge decks, and
              lightweight structural components for aerospace.
