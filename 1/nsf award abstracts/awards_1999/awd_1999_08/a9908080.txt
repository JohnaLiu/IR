The Keystone Science Center will host a conference to
              strengthen and improve teaching in a field setting through an inquiry-based
              approach and using the National Science Education Standards and the Colorado
              State Science Education Standards.  The three-day program will involve 40
              educators and education partners from across the State of Colorado, along with
              some national experts.  An instructional model developed by the Keystone Center
              entitled "Framework for Inquiry-based Science and Student Decision Making" will
              provide the matrix for the development of proceedings that will be disseminated
              on the Web and published in hard copy.
