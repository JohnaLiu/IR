The Biomedical Engineering Materials and Applications (BEMA)
              Roundtable (BEMA) will provide a forum for identifying major opportunities for
              applying engineering principles to create and improve clinical performance of
              medically useful materials and devices, including implants, as well as for
              discussion of strategies for overcoming obstacles-technical, legal, or
              cultural-that impede transition of new materials and devices to clinical
              application.  The roundtable will be a joint activity of the Commission on
              Engineering and Technical Systems' National Materials Advisory Board and the
              Institute of Medicine's Health Sciences Policy Program. The roundtable would
              not provide advice or recommendations on any specific issue or policy pending
              before any government agency, but may propose formal studies that might be
              developed by the Academy. The general objectives of the Biomedical Engineering
              Materials and Applications Roundtable (BEMA) are to: (1) provide a neutral
              setting for the exchange of information about issues related to biomaterials
              science, research, and practice; (2) identify and discuss priority issues in
              the general areas of biomaterials and their use in the development, manufacture
              and application of medical devices; and (3) conduct problem-solving and
              issue-identification activities such as workshops that would address issues in
              greater depth. The Roundtable will facilitate the achievement of these
              objectives by its continuity over time, the unofficial nature of its
              deliberations, the neutrality of the NRC/IOM auspices, and the moderating
              influence of members who have no immediate stake in the outcome of the
              Roundtable's discussions.
