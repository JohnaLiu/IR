Abstract    :
              9908906  Ergas  This is an award to support research investigating the possible
              use of a microporous membrane bioreactor for hydrogenotrophic denitrification
              of water containing excessive concentrations of nitrates.  The membrane serves
              to support the microbial population capable of oxidizing hydrogen and
              accomplishing denitrification, increases the rate at which mass transfer of
              hydrogen is accomplished and acts to separate the active microbial culture from
              the water being treated. Objectives of this project are to investigate the
              factors that control hydrogen and nitrate mass transfer to the microbial
              culture, to determine denitrification rates and impact of the process on water
              quality.  Results of this research are expected to provide the basis for
              calibration of mathematical models of hydrogen and nitrate mass transfer and
              biodegradation in membrane-based processes for treatment of water to reduce
              concentrations of nitrate to acceptable levels.  These models are in turn
              expected to provide the basis for determining the potential application of
              processes based on this concept in engineering design of systems that address
              nitrate contamination of ground and surface water. ***
