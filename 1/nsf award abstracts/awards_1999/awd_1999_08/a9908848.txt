Proposal Title: Self-Consistent Solar Wind Acceleration
              and Heating Due to Wave-Particle Interactions

Principal Investigator: Tom T
              Chang, MIT  


The investigators will construct the first self-consistent
              kinetic model of how ion and electron velocity distributions interact with
              plasma fluctuations in the solar wind. The main effort is to extend a
              successful research project on the "polar wind" emanating from the
              magnetosphere of the Earth to the solar wind. One of the main goals of the
              investigation is to provide a physical interpretation that relates observations
              of the solar corona to spacecraft measurements in the solar wind. Preliminary
              results indicate those wave particle interactions due to electromagnetic waves
              at ion cyclotron frequencies may provide the heating and acceleration of the
              solar wind in general, and the preferential acceleration of helium ions in
              particular.
