This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
              Massachusetts will support continuing operations of the SeaNet project, a
              development bringing enhanced communications protocols, including Internet
              access, to research vessels of the U.S. academic research fleet.  This
              capability substantially enhances efforts for outreach and K-12 educational
              activities, in particular, for researchers combining real-time research
              projects at sea with public and elementary education activities.  SeaNet also
              offers vessel operators substantial benefits in managing shipboard
              communications on behalf of scientific users of the vessel, and introduces
              common protocols and high-speed access at lower communications cost.  Already
              implemented on five academic research vessels, the present award will provide
              for operations and testing as development and expansion of the capability are
              planned.
