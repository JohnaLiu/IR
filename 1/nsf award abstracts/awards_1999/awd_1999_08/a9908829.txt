WALKER, DONALD 
UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO    
The
              project will investigate the relationship between climate change, tundra
              ecosystem, and soil type as part of a multidisciplinary project that addresses
              the impact of global change on land-atmosphere-ice interactions (LAII) in the
              Arctic.  Regional scale variations in climate gradient and vegetation will be
              compared to soil type by producing circumarctic maps of vegetation from
              satellite imagery in combination with field work to verify vegetation and soil
              classifications.  The regional maps and climate models will be used to project
              the effects of a warming climate on the carbon cycle, exchanges of trace gas
              fluxes, water and energy, permafrost, and the hydrological cycle.  The results
              of this project will be used in combination with other LAII projects to
              determine the regional impacts of global change on terrestrial systems in the
              Arctic.
