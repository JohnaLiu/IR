Abstract    :
              The project will study a novel idea using heat pipe technology to eliminate the
              need of fluid in drilling.  The effect of heat pipe cooling will be
              investigated analytically and experimentally.  During drilling, the heat pipe
              rotates and is subjected to centrifugal and Coriolis forces.  In a conventional
              heat pipe, capillary force pumps fluid from the condenser to the evaporator. 
              However, this function will be performed by centrifugal force in the proposed
              approach.  A three-dimensional numerical analysis will be performed to predict
              the temperature in the drill and in the heat pipe.  A companion experimental
              study will be performed using twist drills with heat pipes to assess the
              effectiveness of heat pipes in reducing tool wear and cutting fluid. 
              Temperatures will be measured using infrared sensors and thermocouples. The
              research will be conducted by a multi-disciplinary team with participants from
              University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Oakland University, and Lamb Technicon.
              
	
This project has the potential of simultaneously improving quality and
              reducing costs for drilling, by increasing drill tool life and eliminating
              cutting fluid.  Environmental concerns provide an additional impetus towards
              eliminating the cutting fluid.
