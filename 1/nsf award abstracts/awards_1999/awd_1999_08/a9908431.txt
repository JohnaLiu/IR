Abstract    :
              The proposed investigation will provide measurements of selected acidic gases
              and aerosol species aboard the NSF/NCAR C-130 research aircraft for the TOPSE
              airborne experiment.  TOPSE is the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the
              Spring Equinox experiment, which is a multi-investigator program designed to
              study the production and transport of ozone and other contaminant compounds
              over the mid-latitude to polar Northern Hemisphere during the transition from
              winter to spring conditions.  The principal focus of this investigation is on
              HNO3, with additional measurements of SO2, HCOOH, CH3COOH, and the naturally
              occurring radionuclides 210Pb, 7Be, and 10Be.  These measurements will address
              issues involving the sources, partitioning, and cycling of reactive nitrogen,
              the photochemistry of organic compounds in the polar springtime, and the origin
              of air masses encountered during the study.
