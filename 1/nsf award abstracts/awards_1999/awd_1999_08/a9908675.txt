Motion Display in the Treadport Locomotion Interface

Locomotion
              interfaces represent a new field, and at this early stage
there are many
              uncertainties about the best approaches. This exploratory
research is
              concerned with the mechanical display of slope,
inertia, and turning on a
              treadmill-based locomotion interface, the 
Sarcos Treadport. The Sarcos
              Treadport comprises a linear tilting 
treadmill, an active mechanical tether,
              and a CAVE-like visual display.  
The active mechanical tether, which is the
              unique aspect of the Treadport,
measures user position and applies axial
              forces to the user.
Although the treadmill is a linear device, the research
              aims to show that the
tether coupled to the visual display provides a
              reasonable basis for
turning control.  The force-producing capability of the
              active tether
offers the unique ability to simulate inertial forces during
              running,
which are otherwise absent because the user is stationary. 
              Treadmill
tilt mechanisms are typically too slow to display rapid slope
              changes.
By pulling on the user to simulate uphill walking and pushing
              for
downhill walking, the active mechanical tether can simulate gravity.
The
              PIs propose to conduct a series of biomechanical, modeling, and
psychophysical
              studies to demonstrate the proposed motion displays for
turning, inertial
              force, and slope using an active mechanical tether.
The objective is to show
              that adding a mechanical tether to linear 
treadmills is a useful and
              reasonable approach towards locomotion 
interfaces, and that the proposed
              locomotion display approaches have 
some scientific basis and are effective
              from a user standpoint.
