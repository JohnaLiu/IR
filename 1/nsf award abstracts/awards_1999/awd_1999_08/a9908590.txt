Abstract    :
              This project will study the explosive and hazardous disintegration of lava
              domes, observed at Soufriere Hills volcano and at Merapi volcano, that is
              hypothesized to result from gaseous overpressurization of the dome core. 
              Explosive failure is typically delayed hours to days from the initial core
              pressurization event, suggesting the role of outward gas pressure-diffusion in
              triggering failure.  Diffusing gas over-pressures inititate spalling of the
              dome periphery, that ultimately transects close to the dome core, resulting in
              the explosive release of core pressure, and the potential development of
              pyroclastic flows.  This study will examine the interplay between gas transport
              and mechanical behavior within the dome interior, defining fluid and thermal
              diffusion rates, and ultimately providing the necessary constraint to
              effective-stress models of stability, including those representing progressive
              and retrogressive failure.  This study will examine the progressive collapse of
              lava domes, define the interplay of pressure-diffusive and thermal transport in
              defining strength loss, define the time-scales over which the pressurization
              operates, delineate potential precursors to collapse, and offer an evaluation
              of the potential for collapse prediction.
