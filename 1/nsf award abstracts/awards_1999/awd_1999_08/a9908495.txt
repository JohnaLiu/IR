The primary objective of the
              Office of Minority Programs (OMP) is to increase the recruitment, retention,
              and graduation of underrepresented students pursuing undergraduate and graduate
              degrees in engineering.  This work has been carried out within the larger
              purpose of increasing the pool of talented minority high school students
              interested in engineering and heightening awareness of engineering within
              minority communities.  OMP efforts include a week-long residential program for
              rising high school juniors and seniors, a summer bridge academy for first-year
              students, internships in the corporate sector, and research opportunities with
              University of Virginia faculty.  As a result of OMPs programs, over 249
              underrepresented minority undergraduate students and 122 graduate students have
              received degrees from the engineering school during the last ten years.
