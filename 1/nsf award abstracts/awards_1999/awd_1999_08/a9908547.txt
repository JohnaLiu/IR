This US-Brazil award supports a three year collaborative
              research between Drs. Thomas H. Hinckley,  David V. Sandberg, and Ernesto
              Alvarado, of the University of Washington, and Dr. Joao Andrade de Carvalho of
              the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais for a study of biomass combustion
              in Brazilian Amazon forest fires.  The collaborators will develop a modeling
              methodology to assess the flaming and smoldering combustion of tropical biomass
              from slash fires in the Brazilian Amazon forest, and the change in flammability
              of primary forest adjacent to the deforested clearcuts created for the slash
              burns.  The project consists of combustion measurements of open slash burn from
              deforested primary forest and laboratory burning of tropical woods in a wind
              tunnel under controlled environmental conditions.  Open controlled fires will
              be conducted in farms near Alta Floresta, Mato Grosso in the Brazilian Amazon
              forest.  Laboratory experiments will be conducted at the Combustion and
              Propulsion Laboratory of the Brazil's National Institute of Space
              Research.

This award will lead to the development of fire-danger rating
              capability for tropical forests and savannahs, better guidelines for
              controlling the effects of fires in the Amazon Region, and an improved estimate
              of the carbon released and carbon sequestered by tropical ecosystems.
