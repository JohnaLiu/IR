This one-year award for an U.S.-Swiss research project in
              environmental technology supports Dr. John C. Little and a graduate student
              from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University for collaboration with
              Dr. Alfred J. Wuest, head of the Environmental Physic Program at the Federal
              Institute for Technology in Zurich, Switzerland.  The project addresses the
              impact of bubble-plume diffusers on a water-supply reservoir.  Bubble-plume
              diffusers are used to replenish oxygen in the hypolimnion of stratified
              reservoirs.  These devices are required to preserve cold-water fisheries,
              improve raw water quality in water-supply reservoirs, and mitigate
              environmental consequences of hydropower generation.  Evidence indicates that
              bubble-plume diffusers can have a significant impact on ambient conditions
              within a reservoir (promoting mixing and enhancing sediment oxygen demand), and
              that conditions within a reservoir can in turn have a severe impact on the
              performance of a bubble-plume.  The investigators propose to develop an
              integrated model in which the behavior of both bubble-plume diffusers and the
              reservoir are coupled.   This collaboration takes advantage of the
              complementary expertise of the U.S. investigator in cross-media mass transfer
              and the Swiss investigator's in bubble-plume modeling and aeration
              technology.
