Abstract    :
              Abstract: The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory is held
              approximately every eighteen months at sites alternating between North America
              and abroad.  The 2000 Symposium will be held at Sorrento Palace Hotel,
              Sorrento, Italy on June 25-30, 2000.  This proposal requests support for the
              travel expenses of U. S. participants, particularly graduate students and young
              faculty members, whose papers have been selected for presentation at the
              Symposium, but who lack funds and might not be able to attend without travel
              support.  The co-chairs of the symposium, Ezio Biglieri and Sergio Verdu, will
              determine who is awarded a travel grant.  The average travel grant will be
              $750.
