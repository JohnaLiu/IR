Abstract    :
                   Girls Dig It Online will expand, refine and field test the
              Internet-enhanced learning component of Girls Dig It, a nationwide Girls
              Incorporated archaeology program for girls ages 12-14 currently being piloted
              at six test sites across the country.  Girls Dig It Online will be piloted at
              four of the six Girls Dig It pilot sites - Santa Barbara, CA; Bloomington, IN;
              Lynne, MA; and St. Louis, MO - which have been selected for their
              archaeological resources and technological readiness.  The program will reach
              out to low-income girls and girls of color in the critical early adolescent
              period when girls have traditionally traded in their interest in science,
              mathematics, and technology for other pursuits.
     Girls Dig It Online will
              use the popularity of archaeology - a science that captures the imaginations of
              young people - as a bridge to sustained participation in science and technology
              education for girls.  The program will engage girls in discovery-based
              girl-centered activities that build their understanding of the principles of
              scientific investigation while building collaborative research teams at and
              among each of the four pilot sites.
     The computer-enhanced learning
              environment will include interactive online components for girls including:
  
                1) A password-protected threaded discussion area hosted by a team of
              practicing professional 		            archaeologists;
     2) A monthly "Ask
              the Scientist" program that will create the opportunity for girls to ask
              questions of 	            women scientists working in archaeology and related
              sciences; and
     3) A publicly accessible area where girls will create and
              publish online science exhibitions chronicling 	           their archaeological
              investigations, including photos, drawings and measurement records of artifacts
              	            being studied, hypotheses regarding the sites being excavated
              (either in simulation or as assistants to 	            professional
              archaeologists) and debates about the validity of their hypotheses.
     The
              web site will also serve as a resource for adult program facilitators and will
              include:
     1) A password-protected threaded discussion area where the adult
              facilitators of the program 		            nationwide, along with the consulting
              archaeologists and other participating scientists can exchange 	           
              their field notes on the effects of the online component on the girls'
              understanding of the scientific 	            basis of archaeological inquiry,
              as well as their comfort level with working with computer and 	           
              online technology;
     2) A publication component where the results from this
              field test will be published as a resource for 	           other educators
              developing web-assisted informal education programs.
     Building on its
              strong foundation of informal science education, including Eureka!.  Career
              Development for Teen Girls through Math, Science and Sports; Operation SMART. 
              Science, Math and Relevant Technology, and on its new initiative, GirlsLink, an
              effort to equip girls with technology skills to enhance their education and
              career preparedness, Girls Dig It Online promises to attract new groups of
              girls both to science through archaeology and to information technology through
              interactive and sophisticated uses of computer and Internet technology in a
              supportive environment.
