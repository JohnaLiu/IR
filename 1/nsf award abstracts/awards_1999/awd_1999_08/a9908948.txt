Abstract    :
              This award supports a two-day interdisciplinary workshop on mobile computing and
              networking systems.  The workshop will be held on June 13-14, 1999 at the
              University of Cincinnati.  Twenty-five to thirty experts are invited to give
              special lectures, serve on panels and engage in general discussion about future
              directions in this important research area.  The workshop will result in a
              report on the future directions of mobile computing and networking systems.
