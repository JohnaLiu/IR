Abstract    :
                   This extension of the Borough of Manhattan Community College's (BMCC's)
              highly successful NSF Gender Equity grant, Portfolios to Increase the Number of
              Women in Mathematics, will increase interest, retention and achievement of
              women in SMET.  BMCC is one of the largest producers of associate degrees for
              African-American and Latino students in the country.  An important part of the
              education of a mathematical scientist is the opportunity to try on the persona
              of a mathematician.  Research is a key part of this persona, and we want to get
              more women involved.
     Project objectives are to improve the technological
              skills of our women research fellows, increase the number of women taking
              advanced mathematics courses, and to increase the number of women mathematics
              majors.  To achieve these objectives, WARM:  Women's Animated Research in
              Mathematics will:  provide mathematical summer and academic year mathematical
              research fellowships; run one academic year and two summer workshops for these
              women research fellows; and develop both a print and web manual of projects for
              mathematical research that have been successful for community college women.
