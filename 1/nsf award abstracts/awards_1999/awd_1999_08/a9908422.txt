Abstract    :
              This workshop, sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the National
              Science Council of Taiwan, is an assessment of the challenges and critical
              research needs of design and verification in giga-scale (nanometer)
              technologies. Rapid scaling of technologies enables a very high degree of chip
              integration. It will soon be feasible to integrate a complex electronic system
              on onto a chip, including microprocessors, embedded
memories, programmable
              logics, and various application specific circuit components. However, there is
              no proven design methodology and tools to support such giga-scale design and
              integration.  Research questions being addressed are:  How to provide
              sufficient design abstraction which takes into consideration the electrical
              details in nanometer design?;  How to represent and characterize reusable
              blocks which can be used across the boundaries of technology generations,
              foundries and design environments?;  How to model the interaction of
              heterogeneous functional blocks for overall simulation and optimization?; 	How
              to certify "known good design" under functional specification and performance
              constraints?  The workshop report contains a statement of the workshop findings
              with regard to promising opportunities for innovation, and recommendations
              regarding the style and kind of research to be conducted. It identifies and
              suggestions to the community as to how to implement the recommendations.
