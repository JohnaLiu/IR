Abstract    :
              9908649 

Recent research results in diverse areas qualitatively confirm the
              importance of upper ocean biological processes in determining the role of the
              oceans in global carbon flux.  Furthermore, the oceanic microbiota have emerged
              as an intergral component in oceanic carbon cycling and in the ocean response
              to near term (decadal scale) climate fluctuations.  The compelling evidence of
              biological controls and the availability of powerful new methodologies(e.g.
              molecular ecology, remote sensing) provide us with an unprecedented
              opportunity.  It is within our reach to define explicitly the diversity of
              interactions of the oceanic microbiota with key carbon pools and, moreover, the
              controls on these interactions over the relevant time and space scales needed
              to place these processes in a global context.  We therefore propose to
              undertake a focused workshop to bring together leaders in the field of marine
              microbial ecology and biogeochemistry 1) to review the salient aspects of
              recent advances and 2) to clearly identify and articulate the key research
              objectives for the next decade which will most greatly promote our
              understanding of the marine biota in carbon cycling.  Our ultimate goal is to
              develop a sufficient mechanistic knowledge of these systems to allow prediction
              of the response of the oceanic microbiota to environmental perturbations with
              respect to carbon cycling.  An explicit outcome of the workshop will be
              recommendations for the critical research areas for the next decade that will
              best foster this objective.
