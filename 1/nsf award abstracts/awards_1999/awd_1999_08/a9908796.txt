Abstract    :
              This proposal concerns the study of transport properties in zeolite membranes
              used in separations processes.  The particular objective of this study is to
              investigate the relative influence of both zeolite and non-zeolite pore
              diffusion pathways on transport behavior and chemical selectivity in these
              systems.  This is a significant issue given the great variety of zeolite
              structures that can be produced using different synthesis methods, and the
              likelihood, in each case, of membrane structures being formed with varying
              degrees of zeolite and non-zeolite pore domains.  The transient permeance data
              to be measured during the course of this research will be extremely useful for
              furthering our understanding of the relative contributions of zeolite and
              non-zeolite pore diffusion pathways in these systems.  As pointed out in the
              proposal, the formation of non-zeolite pathways between crystal boundaries is
              often unavoidable, and there is a need to characterize these pathways and
              better understand their role in affecting membrane performance in separations
              processes.
