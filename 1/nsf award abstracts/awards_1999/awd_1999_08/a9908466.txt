This US-Mexico award will support Prof. Terrence D.
              Fitzgerald of SUNY-Cortland in a research collaboration with Prof. Alfonso R.
              Pescador, of the University of Colima in Colima, Mexico.  The researchers
              intend to investigate the trail-based foraging system of the tropical
              caterpillar Hylesia lineata.  Specifically, they will determine the
              chemical/physical basis of trail-marking, the types of information the
              caterpillars extract from their trail-system, and the extent to which the
              trail-marking system of the caterpillar facilitates cooperative foraging and
              the exploitation of the host tree. 

The Mexican researcher brings to the
              collaboration expertise in the ecology and bionomics of the insect from years
              of studying their ecology at the Estacion de Biologia Chamela.  The US
              investigator brings to the project an extensive background in the study of
              sociality of caterpillars and methods to study and analyze their communication
              systems.  It is expected that the resulting study should yield insights in the
              evolution of cooperation in this important and understudied group of social
              insects.
