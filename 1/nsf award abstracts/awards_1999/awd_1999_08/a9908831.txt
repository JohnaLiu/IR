this award provides support from the Division of Civil and
              Mechanical Systems in the Directorate for engineeirng at NSf for the
              organization and conduct of the colloquium titled "a New Milennium Colloquium
              on the Future of Civil and Environmental Engineering"  The goal of the
              colloquium organizers is to bring together a group of leading Civiil and
              Enviromental Engineering (CEE) educators and practitioners to explore the
              likely evolution in the Civil Engineering profession on the coming decades, and
              to consider how the CEE educational institution my better prepare to lead in
              and respond to that evolution.

The organization will be accomplished by two
              committes: 1) an internal faculty planing comittee from MIT and 2) a national
              advisory committee of CEE department chairs.  The basic format for the
              colloquium is established as centered around five theme sessions:  industry
              academic relations; informaiton and other technologies; relation between the
              natural and built evniroment; promotion of innovation; and education for the
              21st century.  The workshop will be held March 19-21, 2000 at MIT.  the award
              is for partial fanancial support for the colloquium which will make it possible
              to enhance the conduct of the event, and to ensure the widest possilbe
              dissemination of the colloquium's proceedings in both priint and video media
