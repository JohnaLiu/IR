Abstract    :
              

This proposal describes a one-year activity in which the PI will conduct
              investigation and develop a unique technique for bonding a 4x8 smart pixel
              array consisted of GaAs vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and
              p-i-n photodetectors onto a Si-CMOS circuitry in an interleaving manner.  Such
              photonic integrated smart pixels will perform logic functions for applications
              in parallel imaging processing, database comparators, optical computing, shared
              memory proccessor interconnect, and many more.
