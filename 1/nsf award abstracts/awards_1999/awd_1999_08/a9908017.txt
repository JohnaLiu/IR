Abstract    :
              The School and Workshop on Connecting Fundamental Physics and Cosmology
will
              take place at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences
              in
Cambridge, England August 16-27, 1999. The School and Workshop
              will
endeavor to renew and enrich the important relationship between
              cosmology
and theoretical elementary particle physics, especially string
              theory. 
Both graduate students and more senior scientists will participate.
              
Possible insights into cosmology from studies in string theory, and
              into
string theory from observations in cosmology, will be explored.
              This
School and Workshop can serve to promote progress in both these
              very
timely areas.
