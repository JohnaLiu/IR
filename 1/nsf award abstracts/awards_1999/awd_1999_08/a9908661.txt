Abstract    :
              This proposal describes a scientific inquiry into the synthesis of cyclams and
              their use as coordinating elements in supramolecular chemistry.  Cyclams will
              be synthesized as a variety of structural motifs which, when coordinated with
              metals, will act as spacers to link metal ions as well as caps to terminate
              these chains.  Applications that are foreseen include possible use in
              catalysis, small molecule encapsulation and activation, electron transfer
              studies and nonlinear optical studies.

With this Award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Louis S.
              Hegedus of Colorado State University.  Professor Hegedus' research centers on
              the manipulation of metal atoms by employing "designer" organic molecules that
              bind to these atoms in very specific ways.  In this way, the properties of
              individual metals can be altered.  Further extension of these methods to
              instances where more than one metal atom is coordinated will give rise to
              complexes which are likely to possess interesting properties.
