Abstract    :
                   This proposal seeks support for the above Topical Conference within the
              American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Annual Meeting to be held in
              Dallas, Texas. Dr. Barbosa-Canovas and Steve Lombardo (Coca-Cola Company) are
              co-chairs of the meeting. This conference series is the only food meeting that
              specifically seeks to combine engineering fundamentals with basic principles of
              food science to insure that the latest scientific and engineering advances are
              disseminated to researchers in the field. The theme of the 1999 conference is
              on food engineering priorities for the 21st century and the integration of food
              engineering with other engineering disciplines.  Among the key sessions are
              many of current interest to BES and our community of researchers:
Structure
              and function of biopolymers
Membrane separations
Sensors and control in food
              processing
Advances in fermentation technology
Biotechnology advances for use
              in food processing
Food engineering education

     The conference will
              provide an excellent opportunity for U.S. academic researchers to network and
              develop collaborations with a large group of industrial food engineers and
              scientists.
     The proposal requests $7,500 from NSF to support the travel
              and registration costs of six of the U.S. academic speakers. Additional
              conference support from AIChE, Washington State University, and several
              companies will cover printing and mailing costs, clerical support for the
              meeting, and two evening receptions.
