This award funds the first year of a collaborative research
              program between the Engineering Research Center at the California Institute of
              Technology on Neuromorphic Engineering Systems with the Institute of
              NeuroInformatics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and the
              University of Zurich, Switzerland.  The goals of the effort are:  (1) to
              measure and model the computational properties of neuronal networks in the
              mammalian cortex, in particular the visual vortex of primates, (2) to build
              analog VLSI and optoelectronic hardware to perform useful sensory tasks and do
              the computations, and (3) to construct single-chip modules for landmark-based
              navigation..  The effort involves support for one key researcher at each
              institution per goal area, and for travel  by the personnel to collaborate and
              coordinate the work.    In addition, the effort involves development of classes
              and teaching material in neuromorphic engineering, the development of new
              laboratory equipment needed for the research, and development of software and
              hardware platforms for the research.
