Abstract    :
              This research project will develop mathematical and computational methodology to
              optimize the design of the "fast-pick area" of a warehouse (the small,
              conveniently-located region where most order-picking is concentrated and which
              does restocking from a bulk storage area support). The methodology will include
              algorithms to answer the key questions: How large should the fast-pick area be?
              Which products should be represented there? How much of each product should be
              stored there?  The methodology will answer these questions by taking into
              account the physical dimensions of every product in the warehouse, the
              dimensions of every storage mode, the space available in the warehouse, and the
              patterns among customer orders.

This methodology will "tune" the design and
              layout of a distribution center to the expected flow of products and so reduce
              the work-content required to move the product. This will reduce the labor
              requirements (especially of overtime and temporaries) while getting maximum
              value from storage equipment.  In
addition, it will reduce inventory levels,
              increase responsiveness of the distribution center and smooth product flows
              downstream.
