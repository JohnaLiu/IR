Abstract    :
              
It is proposed to convene a conference entitled "Interdisciplinarity
              Revisited:  Materials Research as the Case Study" to be held  August 30-31,
              1999 at Penn State University.
About 200 people are planned to be invited with
              representation from a large variety of institutions, research areas, including
              research leaders, managers, educators, and policy makers.  The goal of the
              conference is to use materials research as the "best" example of
              interdisciplinarity to examine how well funding agencies, particularly NSF have
              fared in supporting this type of research since the early 1970s.  It is hoped
              that in the conference "senior scientists will evaluate their experiences and
              provide reflective guidance for improving the direction of future research, and
              teaching." The outcome of the conference will be published in various forms and
              should be useful to the materials community and funding agencies.
