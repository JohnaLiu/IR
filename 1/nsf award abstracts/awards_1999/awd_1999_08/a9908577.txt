This award supports Uwe Bunz, several senior faculty, and several
              junior researchers to attend the U.S.-France-Germany workshop on Carbon-Rich
              Organometallic Compounds in Erlangen, Germany.  The workshop will be hosted by
              the University of Erlangen under the direction of Prof. John Gladysz of the
              Institute for Organic Chemistry in coordination with the PI and with the French
              co-organizer, Prof. Pierre Dixneuf of the University of Rennes, France.  There
              will be fifteen participants from each country.  The workshop will bring
              together leading scientists and junior researchers in the study of carbon-rich
              organometallics in order to exchanges ideas that will lead to future
              collaborative activity.  This is a novel and rapidly expanding field that is on
              the frontier of many areas of chemistry.
