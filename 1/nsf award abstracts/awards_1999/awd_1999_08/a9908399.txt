Abstract

	This project involves the upgrade of a 500 MHz NMR
              spectrometer to provide state-of-the-art capabilities in order to support the
              research of a group of users in the Department of Chemistry at University of
              Massachusetts, Amherst.  The major research projects will be facilitated by the
              availability of the new instrumentation.  This research will include
              determination of the structure of the peptide-binding domains of the molecular
              chaperones DnaK and BiP; determination of bound conformation of signal
              sequences upon interaction with their receptors;  determination of the
              structure of an SRP-binding RNA fragment alone and in complex with a
              polypeptide; studies of the mechanism of folding of the predominantly
              beta-sheet protein, cellular retinoic acid biding protein; structural analysis
              of myoglobin mutants as models for guanylate cyclase; conformational studies of
              model helical peptides; determination of the active site geometry of
              metalloproteins; determination of the structure and dynamics of membrane
              proteins, including E. coli chemotactic receptors and colicin A; studies of
              domains of the E. Coli chemotactic receptor that are involved in adaptation;
              and determination of the structures of ribosomal proteins and the RNAs to which
              they bind.  Additional projects will further utilize the remaining time on this
              instrument.
