WGBH is shooting some test footage for a science series on
              fire.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will enable the producers to
              film a major controlled burn, called Frostfire, in the forests north of
              Fairbanks, Alaska.  This is the only opportunity to film this 2,200 acre burn
              that has been set to examine the ecological consequences of fire on land and in
              the air.  Researchers have been studying the hydrology, climate and ecosystem
              of this watershed since 1969, and the fire will be a continuation of that
              research, aiming to extend the understanding of the effects of this type of
              disturbance in many areas, including global warming, permafrost vulnerability,
              vegetation patterns and variables, and fire and smoke plume behaviors.

This
              SGER also will enable WGBH to examine how the television series can best
              present this kind of major fire in the series.  While there have been images of
              mass fire presented on television before, filmmakers have almost always come to
              a large fire that is already in progress.  Being involved in the planning and
              initial phases of the Frostfire effort will enable WGBH to test the extent to
              which it is possible, by taking advantage of the scientists' planning and by
              careful placement of cameras, to record a fire in a new and meaningful
              way.

The production team also will be able to experiment with and establish
              the best ways to track a fire.  This knowledge can then be applied to future
              filming of wildfires.
