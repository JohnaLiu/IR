Abstract    :
              This workshop is to explore and assess the state-of-the art in electronic system
              design, and identify the research needed by this field in light of
              exponentially growing complexity and functionality. Topics covered include CAD
              tools; hardware-software co-design; architecture simulation (functional and
              behavioral); verification of functionality, timing, and communication
              protocols; optimizing compilers; and operating systems. Additionally, the idea
              of fostering design methodologies that encourage reuse of components
not only
              at the physical or logic design levels but also at the functional levels will
              be explored. The workshop report includes: (1) a statement of the most pressing
              problems to solve within the next decade, (2)
recommendations regarding the
              style and kind of research to be conducted and suggestions to the community as
              to how to implement these recommendations.
