Abstract    :
              Mary L. Soffa
University of Pittsburgh

Prof. Soffa has been highly
              successful in personally mentoring graduate students.  Of Prof. Soffa's sixteen
              graduated Ph.D. students, 50% are women.  Of her master's degree students,
              twenty-four (53%) are women, one is African American, and one is physically
              disabled.  She currently advises six doctoral students including two women. 
              Among her mentees is a Swedish female that was the first woman to receive a
              doctorate in computer science in Sweden.  Among her graduates, eleven have
              received prestigious pre-doctoral fellowships, two are full professors, three
              are associate professors, two are assistant professors, and one has received
              the NSF Young Investigator Award.  While serving as Dean of Graduate Studies,
              she implemented an innovative program to recruit underrepresented students that
              increased their number by 100% in four years.
