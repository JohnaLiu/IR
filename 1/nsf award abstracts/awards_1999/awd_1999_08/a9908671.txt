Abstract    :
              This award  will establish and operate the scientific data analysis and archive
              center for the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology Ionosphere and
              Climate (COSMIC).  COSMIC is a fully funded satellite mission for the Earth
              Sciences that will make use of recent developments in remote sensing,
              communications technology, and computing to solve some of the most important
              geo-scientific issues today.  In meteorology, COSMIC will provide high vertical
              resolution temperature, pressure and water vapor information for a variety of
              atmospheric process studies and to improve the performance of numerical
              weathermodels, especially in polar and oceanic regions.  For climate research 
              and monitoring it will provide an accurate global thermometer with unequaled
              long-term  stability.  Upper-tropospheric refractivity data from COSMIC may
              shed new light on the recent controversy over te role that tropical convection
              plays in climate feedback.  In the ionosphere,  COSMIC data will accelerate the
              development of physical models for space weather prediction by providing dense,
              accurate, and global electron desnity measurements for model testing and
              initialization.  For geodesy COSMIC data will improve the gravity field by
              almost an order of magnitude over the current state of the art, with important
              implications for investigations of the Anarctic ice sheet mass balance, ocean
              altimetry, plate tectonic studies, and improved orbit determination of civilian
              and military satellites.
