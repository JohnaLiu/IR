This award supports the participation of American scientists in
              a U.S.-Japan seminar on high temperature superconductivity (HTS) to be held in
              Yamanashi, Japan for one week in October l999.  The co-organizers are Professor
              David Shaw of the State University of New York (SUNY) in Buffalo and Dr. Keiji
              Terazawa of the Science and Technology Agency in Japan.  The seminar will focus
              on significant advances that have been made in this area during this decade as
              well as topics of current interest in the field.  The four technical areas to
              be discussed include:  1) tape, cables and coils;  2) bulk synthesis, structure
              and applications;  3) vortex structure, critical current, and AC loss; and  4)
              thin films, new materials and characterization.

The objectives of the
              seminar are to bring together specialists from both countries to  
1) exchange
              information on recent advances in the development of high temperature
              superconductivity (HTS);  2) visit each other's R&D laboratories to gain an
              understanding of the level of equipment and personnel support in HTS; and  3)
              identify the problem areas that are particularly suited for international
              cooperative programs to further the progress of HTS.  The exchange of ideas and
              data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to
              advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative
              projects.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger
              scientists and graduate students.  Proceedings of the meeting are expected to
              be made available, by the organizers, in a published seminar report.
