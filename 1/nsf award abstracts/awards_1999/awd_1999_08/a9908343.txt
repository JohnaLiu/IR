This project entitled Direct Templating and Synthesis of
              Low-Density Molecular Crystal Frameworks will explore materials design based on
              crystalline clathrates.  The principal goals include the design and synthesis
              of host frameworks constructed from topologically complementary guanidinium (G)
              cations and sulfonate (S) moieties of various organodisulfonates by (i) using a
              diversified library of organodisulfonate pillars to generate new guanidinium
              organodisulfonate "porous" host frameworks; (ii) using the library to
              elicidiate molecular recognition factors that govern host-guest assembly and
              guest ordering; (iii) synthesizing GS clathrates based on organodisulfonate
              pillars equipped with various functionalities and shape; (iv) investigating the
              role of GS architectures in directing guest ordering; (v) synthesizing extended
              "multicomponent pillars" in which two monosulfonates projecting from opposing
              GS sheets are coupledby specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding or metal
              complexation; (vi) synthesizing multicomponent frameworks in which
              monosulfonate and disulfonate GS ribbon "modules" combine to form unique porous
              frameworks; (vi) exploring the inherent versatility of these modular materials
              to create a library of host frameworks that can be used for the synthesis of
              functionals materials and for crystallization-based separations protocols;
              (viii) extending these concepts to topologically similar structural homologs
              that replace organosulfonates with organophosphonates and guanidinium ions with
              other cations that have threefold symmetry.

This project will advance the
              understanding of molecular recognition processes governing the assembly of
              low-density host frameworks and the inclusion of guest molecules.  The aim is
              to be able to generate functional materials for potential applications in
              chemically selective and enatioselective separations, as well as materials with
              unique lattice architectures that may lead to novel optoelectronic and magnetic
              properties.
