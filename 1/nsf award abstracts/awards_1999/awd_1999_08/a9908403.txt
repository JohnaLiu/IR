Abstract    :
              On March 28, 1999, an earthquake of magnitude 6.6 (Ms) shook Northern India,
              focused beneath the Garwhal Himalaya.   A similar earthquake occurred in 1991
              within 100 km of this recent earthquake.  This resulted in over 200 slopes
              failures, producing an equivalent net lowering of the landscape of ~ 0.007 mm. 
              This is several orders of magnitude lower than the assumed annual lowering of
              Himalayan landscapes.  The 1991 study questioned the importance of high
              magnitude-lower frequency processes in the evolution of Himalayan landscapes
              and suggested that most effective landscape changes are the result of low
              magnitude-high frequency processes such as weathering and fluvial erosion.  Few
              studies have been undertaken on the effects of great earthquake on landscape
              evolution within the Himalayas and it is therefore difficult to assess if the
              1991 earthquake was typical.  We, therefore, propose to examine the geomorphic
              consequences of the 1999 earthquake and to compare this with the effects of the
              1991 earthquake.  This study will help test if great earthquakes are important
              in the net denudation of Himalyan landscapes and it will also aid in hazard
              mitigation.
