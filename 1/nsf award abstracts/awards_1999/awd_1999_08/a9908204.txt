RINGO

This award funds the second five years of the
              multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for
              Design of Analog/Digital Integrated Circuits in accordance with NSF
              Announcement 97-164.  The lead university is Washington State University, with
              research partners at the University of Washington and Oregon State University
              and an affiliate research sites at the State University of New York at Stoney
              Brook.  The Center meets the I/UCRC Program requirements.

The research
              agenda for the Center addresses 1.) Compact Modeling of One-Dimensional
              Distributed Elements, 2.) High Speed A/D Conversion for Communication
              Applications, 3.) Low Frequency Noise, 4.) Low Sensitivity High Order
              Modulators for Oversampling A/D Converters, 5.) Development of RF Equivalent
              Circuit Models from Physics-Based Device Model, 6.) Design of Low Phase Noise
              Sub-micron CMOS VCOs, 7.) CMOS RF Power Transistor Modeling and Simulation, 8.)
              Methodology for Design of High-Voltage CMOS Transistors in Standard Sub-Micron
              CMOS Process, 9.) Ultra-High Speed Circuit Synthesis and Layout, 10.)
              Deep-Submicron Analog Layout Automation for Performance and Manufacturability,
              11.) Adapative DSP Compensation for Analog Distortions in 2.4 and 5.8 GH3
              Transreceivers, 12.) Switched-Capacitor Circuits in Digital CMOS Technology,
              13.) On-Chip Interconnect Models for High Frequency/Speed Integrated Circuits
              and 14.) An Adaptive Technique for A/D Conversion on Focal Plans.
