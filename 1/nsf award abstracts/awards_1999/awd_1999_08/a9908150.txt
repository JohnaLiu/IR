This award supports the continuation of the long term
              monitoring and in
situ testing of two existing landfills.  The use of waste
              paper sludge as
landfill covers is an excellent recycling and reuse
              methodology, and
economically beneficial as well.  The sludge can be used to
              replace
compacted clay layers or geomembranes, which are usually utilized as
              the
impermeable barrier layer.

These landfills were the first in their
              states (NY and MA) to utilize waste
paper sludge as the impermeable barrier
              layers in the cover systems.  At
one of the sites, the cover was constructed
              using compacted clay in places,
so that direct comparisons can be made between
              the behavior of the paper
sludge cap and a clay cap.  This is unique data, and
              little or no such
long-term data exists.

Monitoring at these landfill sites
              began between 5 and 7 years ago, and
this award will fund the replacement of
              some equipment and the field
activities associated with data acquisition.
