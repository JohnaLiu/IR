Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to support a study to test how well the isotopic
              composition of specific lipids track changes in the isotopic composition of
              water and dissolved inorganic carbon in lakes. The project will use analyses
              that require new and unproven analytical methods for measuring carbon and
              hydrogen isotopes on the extremely small samples involved. If successful, the
              project will provide a valuable new proxy measurement of isotopic compositions
              for paleoclimatic reconstructions.
