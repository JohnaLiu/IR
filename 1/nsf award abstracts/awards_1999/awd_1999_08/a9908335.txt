Abstract    :
              This award provides support for research on how to use haptic interfaces (which
              provide force-feedback and the sense of touch) as a possible alternative to the
              traditional purely visual interface for simulating assembly and disassembly
              operations on a computer.  Specifically, the  research seeks to answer the
              question whether a haptically enabled assembly and disassembly simulation
              environment that allows the user to literally feel the objects in the virtual
              computer world provides a significant improvement over purely visual simulation
              feedback in assembly and disassembly simulations.   A haptically enabled
              assembly and disassembly simulation environment will be developed and compared
              with a number of different available assembly and disassembly simulation
              environments that provide only visual feedback.  Case studies with different
              levels of visual and tactile complexity will be employed.

This award will
              provide for a direct understanding of the utility of using haptic interfaces
              compared to purely visual feedback in assembly and disassembly simulations. 
              Part of the results will be a haptically enabled assembly and disassembly
              simulation environment that can be used for benchmarking and educational
              purposes.  The research will provide a clear understanding of the advantages as
              well as limitations of haptic technology in this area, as well as the potential
              of applying this technology in industrial settings.
