Abstract    :
              Professor Selim Senkan will develop the techniques of combinatorial
              heterogeneous catalysis.  In particular, he will implement automated fast
              parallel synthesis of powder catalyst samples employing traditional
              impregnation methods.  The high-throughput screening of activity and
              selectivity will be done by analyzing the gas phase with resonance-enhanced
              multiphoton ionization (REMPI) followed by detection of photoelectrons of
              photoions with a microelectrode array.  The technique will be tested by
              optimizing the activity and selectivity of multimetallic catalysts for
              cyclohexane dehydrogenation, containing Pt and elements of Group IA-VIA,
              including rare earths.
