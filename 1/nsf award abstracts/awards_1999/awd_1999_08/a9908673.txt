Knowlton
This US-Brazil award provides support for Dr. Nancy Knowlton
              of Scripps Institution of Oceanography to collaborate with Dr. Antonio M.
              Sole-Cava of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro on the genetic analysis
              of relationships between tropical Brazilian and Caribbean marine faunas.
These
              scientists will collect a wide range of fauna from reef systems off the coast
              of Brazil.  The study of this fauna will provide important taxonomic
              information from a little studied region of the world and increase our
              understanding of the true nature of the relationships between Brazilian fauna
              and fauna from other regions.  After collection, the researchers will use a
              suite of molecular markers to study the similarity or divergence between
              individuals found in Caribbean and Brazilian waters that are thought to be the
              same species.
