Maldacena
This US-Mexico award will support Prof. Juan M. Maldacena of
              Harvard University in a research collaboration with Prof. Hugo Morales of the
              Physics Department of the Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana in Mexico City. 
              The researchers intend to work on the quantum aspects of systems that, in the
              context of general relativity, present gravitational fields intense enough to
              require a quantum description.  Black holes and cosmological models are
              obviously connected with such a quest.

The researchers intend to work within
              the framework of string theory, using recent results on the entropy of extremal
              and nearly extremal black holes, intending to expand the theory to cover more
              general black holes. Comparison of these results with those in canonical
              quantum general relativity for the same type of black holes will be given. The
              collaboration will combine the expertise of the Mexican group of researchers in
              canonical quantum gravity with the expertise in string theory of the US
              investigators, one of the leading groups in this area worldwide.
