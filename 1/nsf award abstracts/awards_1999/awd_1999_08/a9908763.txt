This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor A. P.
              Balachandran, Rafael D. Sorkin, and Allen B. Stern in a research collaboration
              with a group of Mexican scientists under the leadership of Denjoe O'Connor of
              the Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnio
              Nacional (CINVESTAV) in Mexico City.  The researchers intend to study "lattice"
              field theories on new geometrical spaces embodying "non-commutative geometry"
              that because they are endowed with sufficient structure, may have strong
              applicability to the development of quantum field theories, to the study of
              General Relativity, Cosmology, and Blade Hole physics.

Ideas from geometry
              have profoundly influenced the development of both classical and quantum
              physics and have in recent years played an increasingly important role in the
              development of adverse branches of physics from quantum field theory and strong
              theory to statistical mechanics, with even intriguing applications emerging in
              the biological science.  This support will bring distinguished researchers in
              both countries to work in a area of much current interest in theoretical
              physics.
