Abstract    :
              9908656  Hao  This is an award to support conduct of a workshop to consider
              research needs for engineering design of processes and systems to manage
              sludges derived from the treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater. 
              Processing and management of sludges derived from industrial and municipal
              wastewater treatment processes have historically absorbed more than half of the
              total cost of managing these wastes to reduce their undesirable impact on
              environmental and public health.  The context of a workshop to consider
              research needs relating to sludge management relates to anticipated increases
              in production and changes in composition of sludges in response to enforcement
              of existing and new regulatory pressures.  Its product is expected to assist
              the Engineering Directorate's relating biocomplexity to environmental
              sustainability and assist in advancing the National Science Foundation's
              commitment to integration of research and education as articulated in its
              strategic plan.***
