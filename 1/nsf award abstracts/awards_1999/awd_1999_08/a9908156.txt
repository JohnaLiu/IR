Abstract    :
              More than 100 billion pounds/year of synthetic polymers were produced in the
              U.S. in 1997 in a wide variety of polymerization reactors.  Ultimately the
              products from these reactors are used in, among others, synthetic clothing,
              automotive structural components, optical disks, and latex paints.

The PI
              plans to continue his research on fundamental studies of polymerization
              processes.  In this project he plans to make use of detailed models for both
              homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic polymerization reactors to analyze and
              explain observed experimental measurements of polymerization rates, molecular
              weight distribution, copolymer composition, chain branching, tactility, and
              other properties.  Special emphasis will be on determining the kinetic behavior
              and polymer product characteristics of metallocene and other single-site
              catalysts.  Close comparison of experimental results and model predictions will
              be made in order to validate the models.  From these models, the PI expects to
              predict the range of reactor design and operation parameters for which target
              polymer properties and desired process behavior are possible in full scale
              reactors.  As part of the study, multiphase thermodynamic models will be
              created through the use of microscale simulations and experimental data.  These
              will be used to create equation-of-state models and phase-separation models for
              several classes of polymerization processes.  The expected work products are a
              deeper understanding and better models - enabling the design and operation of
              reactors capable of producing more uniform and higher quality polymer
              products.
