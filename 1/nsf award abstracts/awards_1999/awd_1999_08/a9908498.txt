Abstract    :
              Ajay K. Bose
Stevens Institute of Technology

For more than forty years, Dr.
              Ajay K. Bose has conducted educational, research and mentoring programs that
              have enhanced the science and engineering careers of hundreds of women and
              minority students at the pre-college, undergraduate and graduate levels.  Prof.
              Bose's most notable contributions include an undergraduate summer research
              program which is now in its 28th continuous year of successful operation.  Over
              400 students that have benefited from this program have pursued careers in
              chemistry and related sciences.  A pre-college version of this program, also
              established by Prof. Bose, has helped high school teachers convey the
              excitement of chemistry through experimentation and has recruited many
              disadvantaged students from inner city schools for summer research experiences.
               Through his "Equipment of the Month Club", Prof. Bose lends sophisticated
              equipment to inner city schools.  Prof. Bose has also mentored thirty-two Ph.D.
              students.
