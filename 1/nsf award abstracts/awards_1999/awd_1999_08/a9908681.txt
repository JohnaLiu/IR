This US-Brazil collaborative research project will support
              Dr. Kristina Vuskovic of the University of Kentucky to work with Professor
              Celina Miraglia Herrera de Figueiredo at the Instituto de Matematica of the
              Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.  The researchers will
              investigate the Perfectly Contractile Graph Conjecture and a possible
              construction of a polynomial time recognition algorithm for perfectly
              contractile graphs through the decomposition method.

Many diverse
              applications in graph theory amount to finding the chromatic number of a graph.
              Unfortunately this problem is NP-complete in general. Perfect graphs are an
              important class of graphs for which the problem can be solved in polynomial
              time.  However, the existing algorithm uses the ellipsoid method and
              consequently does not have satisfactory complexity.  So it is still of great
              interest to try to find a combinatorial algorithm for finding the chromatic
              number of perfect graphs. In an attempt to do so, the class of perfectly
              contractile graphs emerged.  The U.S. PI has expertise in graph decomposition
              techniques, while the Brazilian PI provides the experience in perfectly
              contractile graphs.
