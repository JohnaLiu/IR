SoundVision Productions is requesting a planning grant of
              $53,230 to create "Science and the Search for Meaning," a series of one-hour
              public radio programs and ancillary materials addressing the major scientific
              discoveries of the twentieth century and how they shape the essential
              philosophical and religious questions of our age.  

During this planning
              phase, SoundVision will  1) Identify a format and topics to be covered and
              determine the focus of each program;  2) expand the advisory committee to
              insure representation from a range of disciplines;  3) work with advisors to
              identify key scientific and ethical issues facing society today;  4) define the
              advisors' process of editorial oversight;  5) conduct front end evaluation with
              radio listeners to assess the general level of awareness and interest in the
              subject; and  6) identify a possible series host.
