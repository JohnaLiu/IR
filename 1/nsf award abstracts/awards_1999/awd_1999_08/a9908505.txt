Abstract    :
              This proposal will support the United States Global Change Research Program
              Coordination Office in serving, coordinating, and representing the USGCRP as an
              integrated, coordinated program.  The objective of this office is to be the
              coordinator of the interagency process.  This involves a diverse array of
              activities to carry out the mission given to the Subcommittee on Global Change
              Research (SGCR), and which are not strictly within the purview of any of the
              individual participating agencies.
