Abstract    :
              Despite changes in regulatory policy and the emergence of new technology
              options, considerable uncertainty remains surrounding deployment of broadband
              technology for the last mile, the link to the home and small businesses. 
              Progress has been slow, raising questions about what research, policies, and
              strategies would accelerate deployment and increase broadband access
              availability.  This study examining last mile issues will explore possible
              scenarios and analyze the relationships among technology options, policy
              approaches and business models.  This analysis will be valuable to those
              charged with setting policy, including the Federal Communications Commission
              (FCC) and local and state regulatory entities.  The FCC is currently in the
              midst of implementing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and facing
              considerable pressure and criticism; state public utility commissions are
              literally closer to the consequences of deployment decisions.  The study will
              provide insights to Congress and others evaluating the success of the 1996 Act
              in fostering innovative, competitive services for local access.  It will also
              help consumers and public interest groups understand and evaluate current and
              future technology options.  Given the uncertainty about which technologies,
              regulatory approaches, and business models are likely to prevail, industry also
              stands to benefit from an objective analysis across these dimensions.  This
              project will be distinguished by its integration of technical insights with
              policy and business perspectives.
