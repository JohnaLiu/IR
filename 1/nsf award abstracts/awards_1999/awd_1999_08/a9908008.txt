Abstract    :
              The proposed research will examine interactions between Antarctic sea-ice and
              large-scale Southern Hemisphere circulation  on monthly, seasonal,
              intra-seasonal and interannual time scales. The study will use satellite and
              surface observational data, and a climate model (coupled dynamic
              ocean/atmosphere CSM).  The results will help elucidate processes linking
              specific characteristics of large-scale atmospheric circulation and sea-ice 
              and the sensitivity of one part of the climate  system to changes in another.
              The study will enhance understanding of how the influence of global events like
              ENSO could be  transmitted to the Antarctic and vice versa. The work is
              important because  it  will  improve understanding of model simulation of
              processes at higher latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere.
