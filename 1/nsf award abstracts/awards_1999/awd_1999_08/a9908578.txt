Managing large computer communication networks through
              distributed agents is an emerg-ing area of research towards automated and
              scaleable network management. In the context of this research, an agent is a
              simple algorithm which can reside at a network node, and perform local
              decisions on the state of a network using local information. As many such
              agents can be used in a distributed fashion at a large network, little is known
              how local decisions result in collective effects at network level, and what
              decentralized algorithms can be used by agents at network nodes so that a good
              global performance can be achieved network-wide. To provide answers to these
              questions is crucial to advancing network management from device-centric to
              network-centric which is required by the next generation networks.
The goal of
              this project is to investigate adaptive learning approaches as potential
              solutions to these open problems.  In particular, dynamic probabilistic graph
              models will be investigated and shown to provide a systematic approach for
              accomplishing the following tasks:
(1) developing (local) models to cooperate
              and aggregate information form a neighborhood of agents,
(2) using the (local)
              models developed to perform distributed decisions at network nodes
              adaptively,
(3) developing (global) model by aggregating local statistics to
              characterize resulting global effects of a network of agents.
A rich set of
              methods in the area of adaptive learning systems, especially the dynamic graph
              models, will be shown to provide both a theoretical foundation, and practical
              approaches in managing large networks with an irregular and a changing
              topology, and inaccessible network components.
