Abstract    :
              The Brownsville Urban Systemic Program (BUSP) plans to enhance its current
              infrastructure for K-12 science and mathematics education and transition to
              full implementation of standards-based instruction in order to improve
              significantly K-12 student achievement.  The Brownsville Independent School
              District (BISD) plans: (1) to implement a comprehensive standards-based,
              inquiry-centered mathematics and science curriculum districtwide through
              refinement of existing standards-based curricula, instruction, and assessment,
              infusion of technology, and establishment of new policies in support of science
              and mathematics education; (2) to increase the competency of the instructional
              workforce through sustained professional development and technical assistance;
              (3) to establish partnerships designed to empower the number of skilled
              entrants to the technology-based workforce through improved agreements with
              existing partners and new agreements with manufacturing companies; and (4) to
              improve teaching practice and student learning through research and evaluation.
               

In order to reach this end, the School District plans: (1) to appoint 28
              mentor teachers to serve as mathematics and science reform catalysts
              districtwide; (2) to implement the Advancement Via Individual Determination
              (AVID) change model to increase access to rigorous, academic,
              college-preparatory courses for disadvantaged students; (3) to implement a
              comprehensive professional development program for teachers and school leaders
              focused on content, teaching practices, and instructional resources; and (4) to
              provide additional learning opportunities for students through subject
              coaching, advanced summer academies, enrichment activities, and family
              learning.
