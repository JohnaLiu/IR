Abstract    :
              Samuel F. Hart, Sr.
Mercer University, Georgia

Dr. Hart has demonstrated
              exceptional leadership in inspiring students in their development of
              discipline, self-esteem and self-worth.  During the 1980s, Prof. Hart
              envisioned and initiated a program which identified and developed minority and
              underprivileged students in middle school who had the potential to succeed in
              mathematics and science-related disciplines. He has also been a pivotal
              influence upon hundreds of young minority high school students in Middle
              Georgia, many of whom became first-generation college students.  Of the 103
              African American students mentored by Dr. Hart, fifty-four have earned
              baccalaureate degrees, twenty-six have earned master's degrees and twenty-five
              have earned doctoral or medical degrees.
