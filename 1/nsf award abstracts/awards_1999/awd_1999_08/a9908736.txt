Abstract    :
                   Women for Women:  A Science Mentoring Network at the State University of
              New York at Stony Brook draws on the commitment resources, and expertise of the
              University and its partners in this collaboration; the Brentwood and Riverhead
              School Districts and the Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES).  We
              will create and sustain an ongoing cadre of undergraduate and graduate women
              mentors in science disciplines whose purpose is to encourage and support
              younger women in middle and high schools as they progress through their lives,
              studies, and careers in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology
              fields.
     The mentor thrust will train the university women to be exemplary
              mentors integrating in this effort the development of viable research
              experiences.  This effort will offer middle and high school young women a
              year-long interaction with a committed mentor.  We offer a semester-long mentor
              training course, a two-week summer campus-based, research oriented experience
              in which mentors and mentees will bond and work, and monthly follow-up
              activities during the academic year.
     Additionally, school-based advisors
              will be actively engaged with the young women, the mentors, and the science
              projects.  Parents of the young women will be active participants in the
              delivery of project goals.
