Abstract    :
                  Numerous recent field studies have revealed that organic organic chemical
              species are a major component of atmospheric aerosols.  It has been suggested
              that organic compounds also play an important role in direct radiative forcing,
              as cloud condensation nucleii, and as ice nucleii.  In this project,
              measurements of several organic compounds will be made in cloud water and in
              aerosols near clouds and on the edges of pollutant plumes.  These studies will
              be carried out in the Western Pacific during the spring of 2000 in the region
              of pollution and soil dust outflow from China and Japan.  Measurements made
              during the "China Dust" study will include a suite of carboxylic acids,
              alcohols, and carbohydrates.
