Abstract    :
              This project involves the provision of meteorological support for the
              Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox (TOPSE) program. The
              TOPSE program is designed to study the transport and photochemical production
              of ozone and ozone precursors involved in the production of the tropospheric
              spring ozone maximum over high latitude North America and the Arctic.  The
              program is a multi-investigator, airborne experiment utilizing the NCAR C-130. 
              Meteorological support will involve the assimilation and interpretation of
              meteorological data, calculation of air mass trajectories, participation in
              mission planning, and post-mission interpretation of meteorological data.
