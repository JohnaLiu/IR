HACU'S National Internship Program is a fully administered and
              carefully-managed ten week program that places college students in stimulating
              and challenging professional and educational roles within the federal sector. 
              Utilizing an intensive summer model, HACU and the sponsoring agencies and
              departments provide academically qualified students with experience-based
              teaming.  Student interns are placed in federal offices and laboratories in the
              Washington, DC metropolitan area and in field sites throughout the United
              States and Puerto Rico.  Student placements are based upon position
              descriptions provided by supervisors, who detail the academic preparation, work
              experience and special skills required to perform the job.

This project is
              jointly supported and the Office of the Director (including offices such as
              Office of Legislative and Public Affairs, Office of General Counsel, Office of
              Integrative Activities and Office of Equal Opportunity Programs) and
              participating directorates.
