Abstract    :
              The goal of this meeting is to provide a forum for the discussion of
recent
              work on historical change in syntactic systems in the context of
generative
              grammar.  Historical change constitutes a particular form of
variation.  One
              can find cases where grammars vary only minimally: there
may be just a single
              difference in two abstract systems.  If one can
isolate points of variation in
              this way, one can then ask why the new
system should have emerged in children
              at a certain point in time, and
this may illuminate the way in which children
              acquire their syntactic
capacities.  Within this perspective, the study of
              language change is
fused with work on language variation and the acquisition
              of language.

The meeting will focus on the syntactic effects of changes
              in
inflectional systems, for example examining the effects of the loss
              of
morphological case systems.  It is an old intuition that languages
              with
rich inflection have a different kind of syntax from languages with
              poor
inflection.  Now work within the Minimalist Program posits a
              tight
connection between syntactic operations and morphological
              features:
movement of any element (head or phrasal category) to any
              functional
position takes place only when required to check morphological
              features.
This raises the question of how strong/weak distinctions
              match
morphological properties.  This question will constitute the central
              focus
of the meeting.

In summary,  the meeting will address a major
              question in syntactic theory and
extend the dialogue between historical
              linguists and acquisitionists, on
the assumption that their work is mutually
              enlightening.
