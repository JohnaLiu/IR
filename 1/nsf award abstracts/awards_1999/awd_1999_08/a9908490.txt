Abstract    :
              Science and Mathematics Investigative Learning Experiences (SMILE) Oregon State
              University

SMILE serves Native American, Hispanic American
              and other economically disadvantaged youth in grades 4 through 12 through
              hands-on experiences in science and mathematics. Weekly meetings with twenty
              students and two teachers are the backbone of the program.  Students also
              participate in field trips and community projects with practicing scientists
              and engineers.  SMILE began in 1988, serving 80 students in four middle
              schools.  The program now serves more than 700 elementary, middle and high
              school students along with 70 teachers, in 39 schools.  Eighty-five percent
              (512) of students that participated in SMILE for more that one year graduated
              from high school.  Ninety-eight percent of the SMILE class of 1998 continued on
              to college.  The Oregon-based SMILE program has been successfully replicated in
              Rhode Island.
