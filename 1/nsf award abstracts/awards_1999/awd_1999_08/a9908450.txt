Abstract    :
                   Polymeric composites with cylindrical fiber reinforcements are employed in
              many engineering applications. The service life of these composite structures
              is significantly impacted by failures such as fiber debonding and pull-out from
              the matrix.  One approach to improving the engineering of advanced materials
              stems from an examination of the morphological architectures in biological
              systems and natural materials, which owe their impressive structural properties
              to the hierarchical, multi-scale microstructures. Engineered composite
              materials with multiscale, branched reinforcement structures mimicking
              biological and natural systems can, therefore, potentially offer significant
              property enhancements over conventional cylindrical fiber reinforced
              composites.
     This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
              seeks to perform pilot investigations on a technique for the fabrication of
              such biomimetic composites.  An innovative processing method based on the fluid
              instability phenomenon of viscous fingering, which under appropriate flow
              conditions generates fractal arborescent structures spanning several length
              scales, is proposed to be explored for obtaining the desired reinforcement
              structures in the composites.  The fundamental unknowns concerning the
              practical feasibility of the technique are proposed to be resolved through
              systematic experimental studies.  The anticipated impact of the proposed
              innovation is that of opening up a new class of composite structures with
              superior properties, for use in diverse applications.
