Abstract    :
                   This grant provides funding to advance the state of the art in optimal
              control of non-stationary systems. Specifically, the objective of this research
              is to develop optimal admission and optimal pricing policies
for finite
              capacity, non-stationary queueing systems with multiple customer classes
              offering different amounts of reward to obtain service.  These types of
              queueing models arise in many applications such as production systems,
              communications systems, and airline industry.  The research will involve
              the
following tasks. First, systems where parameters such as rewards, system
              capacity, arrival rates, and service rates change only once at a known time,
              will be considered.   Insights gained from the structure of optimal policies in
              these simple non-stationary  systems will facilitate the analysis of the
              systems where changes occur periodically.  Finally, numerical algorithms will
              be developed to compute the parameters
of optimal policies.
     A major
              contribution anticipated from this research is the development of a fundamental
              science base required for optimal decision making in non-stationary
              environments.  Towards this end, new optimality criteria for non-stationary
              systems will be defined. The educational impact of the research will be in the
              form of classroom instruction, PhD student research, seminars and
              conferences.
