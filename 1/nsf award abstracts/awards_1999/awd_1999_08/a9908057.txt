Abstract    :
              The development of a comprehensive software environment based on scalable
              algorithms for the essential tasks required in unstructured mesh based
              applications.  Unstructured mesh based approaches are a powerful tool in the
              analysis and modeling of problems involving dynamic, multi-scale features and
              complex geometries.  This work will enable such large-scale scientific and
              engineering applications to take full advantage of parallel, high-performance
              computing systems.
