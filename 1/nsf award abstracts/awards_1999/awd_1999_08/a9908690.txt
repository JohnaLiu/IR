VITTAL

The five-year continuing award funds Iowa State
              University to be a new research site of the multi-university
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Power Systems. 
              This new research site is being added to the lead research site at Cornell
              University and the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, University of
              Wisconsin-Madison, University of California-Berkeley, and Washington State
              University.

The Iowa State University research site's research agenda will
              address 1.) System Optimization Using Risk Based Security and Distributed
              Knowledge 2.) Market Interactions and Market Power, 3.) Robust Control of Large
              Scale Power Systems, 4.) Voltage Stability Constrained ATC Calculation and 6.)
              Chaotic Load Models for Power Systems.
