Abstract    :
              The enhancement of nucleate-boiling and the critical heat flux in pool boiling
              will be made using modulated porous-layer coating.  The upper limits for
              enhancement will be examined, described, and optimized through modeling and
              experiments.  A combination of empiricism and theory will be used.  It is
              postulated that the choking limit of liquid delivery to the surface, i.e., the
              critical heat flux, is reached either by the hydrodynamic instability in the
              vapor removal, or by the solid-liquid viscous drag the porous-layer coating,
              whichever is smaller.  It is expected that the results of this investigation
              will produce a porous-layer coating that exhibits optimalpool boiling heat
              transfer, and contribution to advances in high flux surfaces and to the design
              and fabrication of surface micro-structures for heat transfer purposes.
