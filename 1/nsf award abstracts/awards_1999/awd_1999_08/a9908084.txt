Special Project:  1999
              International Workshop on Discrete Algorithms and Methods for Mobile Computing
              and Communications

This award will support graduate student participation to
              the Third Annual Workshop on Discrete Methods for Mobile Computing and
              Communications to be held in conjunction with ACM Mobicom '99 in Seattle, WA on
              August 20, 1999.  The workshop, intended to serve as a forum for open
              discussion and lively debate, will be devoted to discrete algorithms and
              methods in the context of mobile and wireless computing and communications, an
              area that is already having and will have enormous impact in our lifestyle over
              the next several decades.

The workshop, also called DIAL M, encouraging
              research papers based on work-in-progress, brings together distinguished
              members of the computer science and engineering community.  Since the mobility
              aspect of the hosts and routers introduces a whole gamut of new research
              issues, the planned panel discussions and hot topic sessions should highly
              benefit graduate students.
