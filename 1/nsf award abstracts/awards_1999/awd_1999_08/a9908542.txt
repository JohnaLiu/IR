This two-year award is for U.S.-Netherlands cooperative
              research between Beverly Smith of East Tennessee State University and James
              Higdon and Jan van der Hulst of Kapetyn Institute in Groningen, The
              Netherlands, for a comprehensive study of a sample of fifteen extragalactic
              tails and bridges to determine how metal abundances, star formation rates and
              efficiencies vary with gas surface density, interaction parameters and
              timescale, and the stellar and gaseous morphology of the structure.  The
              proposed observations will be made with the William Hershel 4.5m telescope
              (operated by The Netherlands and the UK), and 0.9 telescope operated by the
              Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA), and the National
              Radio Astronomy Observatory 12m millimeter telescope and Very Large Array.  The
              observational study will be done in parallel with hydrodynamical modeling of
              the individual systems in the sample to better define the parameters of the
              interactions and help determine the conditions needed to trigger star formation
              in tails and bridges. 

The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration
              access to the SARA 0.9 telescope, which will be used to obtain the required
              optical imaging data.  This is complemented by Dutch and UK access to the 4.2m
              William Hershel Telescope to obtain the optical spectroscopy that provide
              estimates of the metal abundances.  Higdon brings considerable experience in
              the analysis and interpretation of interacting galaxies.  The project will
              advance understanding of the interstellar medium and star formation properties
              of extragalactic tails and bridges.
