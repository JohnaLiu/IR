Abstract    :
               This award supports international travel for twelve U.S. students and
              researchers who would not otherwise be able to attend the First AgentLink
              European Agent Systems Summer School being held in Utrecht, the Netherlands on
              July 26-30, 1999.   AgentLink, Europe's ESPRIT-funded Network of Excellence for
              agent-based computing, organizes the school (http://www.agentlink.org). It is a
              world-class event that will bring together internationally recognized
              researchers in the area of agents and multi-agent systems to present
              introductory and advanced courses in the theoretical and practical aspects of
              agent-based computing. The objective of this award is to encourage and enable
              two groups of U.S. researchers to attend this event: 1) graduate students of
              outstanding merit who are interested in research in agent systems but have no
              current funding to enable such participation; and 2) researchers in other
              related fields who need encouragement to bring their particular expertise to
              this field and for them to learn about agent-based computing so that they may
              apply it to their own fields. This travel grant will cover their travel, hotel,
              registration fees, and some subsistence. The Europeans are giving similar
              support to their graduate students, i.e., those at European universities who
              are registered AgentLink members. This travel grant allows a strong and diverse
              group of US researchers to attend EASS '99 rather than just a small group of
              elite researchers. Further, because the summer school is in Europe, it provides
              a unique opportunity for American researchers to have direct contact with their
              European colleagues.
