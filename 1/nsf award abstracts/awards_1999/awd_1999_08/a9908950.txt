Abstract    :
              This award will investigate the relationships between F-region neutral winds and
              the topside ionospheric temperature and composition by using measurements of
              both these parameters taken simultaneously.  An extensive database of nighttime
              F-region winds form Arequipa, South America, will be combined with topside
              latitudinal profiles of ionospheric density, temperature, and composition from
              the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites.  By comparing
              the daily variations in the topside with those seen in the meridional F-region
              wind, changes that may be directly attributable to the neutral winds will be
              determined.  This study will be combined with a modeling effort using the Field
              Line Interhemispheric Plasma (FLIP) model to verify that the associations
              implied from the observations can be reproduced with the known physics.  The
              heart of this study is to understand how the diffusive motions of the plasma in
              the topside of the ionosphere are changed by the action of F-region winds. 
              Using these two approaches the roles of neutral winds and chemistry in
              controlling the field-aligned plasma motions in the topside ionosphere can be
              elucidated.
