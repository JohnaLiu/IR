Abstract    :
              Funding is provided for partial travel support for approximately fifty-five
              highly qualified individuals to participate in the 12th World Conference on
              Earthquake Engineering, January 30-February 4, 2000, in Auckland, New Zealand. 
              Without such support, few U.S. researchers will find it possible to
              participate.  It is critically important that U.S. researchers present results
              of their current work in this important international forum, if the U.S. is to
              maintain its recognized leadership in the earthquake engineering field.  The
              World Conference on Earthquake Engineering is the unique major event, which NSF
              sponsors to enable NSF investigators to participate and to enhance their
              research.

EERI will advertise broadly the availability of travel grants,
              convene a blue-ribbon review panel to evaluate applications, coordinate travel
              arrangements, and handle all administrative procedures involved in sending the
              U.S. delegation to New Zealand.
