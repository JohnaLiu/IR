Abstract    :
              This award is to conduct the annual National Science Foundation Design and
              Manufacturing Research Conference.  The conference will involve researchers
              from the Division of Design, Manufacture and Industrial Innovation, the
              Division of Engineering Education and Centers, the Division of Electrical and
              Communication Systems and the Mechanics and Materials Program in the Division
              of Civil and Mechanical Structures, located within the Directorate for
              Engineering; the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems, located
              within the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering;
              and manufacturing related projects in the Division of Materials Research,
              located within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.

The
              conference ensures that the individual researchers are informed about the
              ongoing activities of their colleagues.  An elimination of duplication of their
              efforts may be achieved and a degree of cooperation may result from this
              activity.  An overall improvement of efficiency of the research activity could
              be expected.  In addition, the conference program organization allows for ample
              time to discuss manufacturing research in detail with the collective research
              community at the meeting, with feedback to and input from the National Science
              Foundation.  Finally, personal contacts between the grantees and program
              directors in the Divisions should contribute to clarifying many current issues
              in their work.  The aims of the conference are to enhance communication between
              researchers, encourage joint research, promote synergism, and develop networks
              for technical interchange.  Attendees to the conference gain an early access to
              the information disseminated.
