A study of friction under extreme conditions of load and
              sliding velocity will be undertaken.  This is relevant to a number of
              technologically important situations, such as at tool-workpiece interfaces
              during ultra-high speed machining, friction and explosive welding processes,
              rotating band of an accelerating shell in a gun barrel, interfaces of bodies
              during high velocity impact, rocket driven vehicles on rails, and high
              performance brake liners employed in automobiles and aircrafts.  The conditions
              are such that the temperature at the interface approaches the melt regime of
              the lower melting point material in the tribo-pair. Recent developments in
              experimental methods to investigate high speed friction have enabled
              measurement in this region, at applied normal pressures ranging from 3 to 5 GPa
              and slip speeds of over 150 m/s. 
	
The proposed study will involve, (i) high
              impact velocity pressure-shear plate-impact friction experiments on relatively
              low melting point metals such as aluminum, (ii) detailed transient finite
              deformation elastic-visco-plastic finite element modeling of the impact
              friction process-in order to understand the continuum level predictions of the
              extent of elastic-plastic interactions of the tribo-pair materials, and (iii)
              detailed optical, electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and flourescence (EDS)
              studies to understand the tribo-mechanical and tribo-chemical interactions
              during the sliding process.
