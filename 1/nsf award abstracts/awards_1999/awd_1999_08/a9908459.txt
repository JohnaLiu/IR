The aim of the workshop is to bring together leading scientists
              and engineers who are at the frontiers of electronic device and circuit
              research and development.  Low power digital electronics, microwave power
              circuits, and optoelectronics have become the foundation of today's electronics
              technology.  Yet, they emerged from traditionally separated fields and are
              still largely pursued by specialists trained in different areas.

However,
              the rapid pace of electronic technology evolution is propelling a merger of the
              traditionally separated fields.  Evidence is not hard to find around us. 
              Wireless communication is just one example.  It is time to encourage active
              cross-fertilization of the different "species" in this electronic planet and to
              call for leadership in bringing together the resources and expertise in these
              fields.

This advanced workshop will be a special forum to gather some of the
              most creative minds and leading experts from academia, industry, and government
              agencies, and to review the most recent and exciting breakthroughs in the
              fields, the underlying physical mechanisms that link these advancements, and to
              exchange views on future trends and directions, the market pulls and the
              necessary policy and infrastructure changes.
