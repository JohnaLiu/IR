              Abstract

This proposal requests support for a high-resolution study of
              paleoclimate in Africa.  Because the climates of northwest Madagascar and
              Botswana are affected significantly by ENSO events, paleoenvironmental records
              are also proxy records of SST and El Nino frequency. El Nino events bring
              above-average rainfall to northwest Madagascar and below-average rainfall to
              Botswana. Stalagmites from Botswana, ranging up to 57 cm long, can provide a
              high-resolution record for this area for the last 2000 years. Formations from
              Madagascar, with one stalagmite almost 3 m long, can provide a high-resolution
              record possibly to 15-20 ka ago. This proposal requests funds to fully explore
              the potential of these stalagmites to provide high-resolution regional
              paleoenvironmental information, and also data on SSTs and ENSO, variations in
              del-13C, UV-stimulated luminescence of humic and fulvic acids, particulate
              matter, petrography, layer thickness, inclusion frequency' and gray level along
              the growth axes of stalagmites will be related to regional rainfall and
              temperature, ocean SSTs, El Nino frequencies, and Southern Oscillation
              characteristics.
