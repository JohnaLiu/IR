Abstract    :
              Zafra M. Lerman
Columbia College Chicago

Prof. Lerman has devoted her
              professional career to engaging students' interest in science, and has taken
              great strides to "turn on" minority pupils to science. Through the Institute
              for Science Education and Science Communication, Dr. Lerman serves as a role
              model for the college community by making the Institute a "home" for minority
              students.  Lerman has created an innovative curriculum in which students are
              encouraged to apply their interests, strengths, talents, and cultural
              backgrounds to their science coursework.  She established a program of teaching
              science through dance.  In the community "Mother Zafra" has lead a program for
              parents, teachers, and students of a street gang infested Southwest side
              (Chicago) neighborhood to increase awareness of and competence in science
              related matters.  For most of the 16,000 plus students, who have participated
              in these programs, this is the first time they began thinking about attending
              college.
