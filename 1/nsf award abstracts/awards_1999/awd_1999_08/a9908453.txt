Abstract    :
              This project will adapt for application to Doppler lidar the techniques of
              four-dimensional data assimilation that have been developed for Doppler radar. 
              Lidar offers the advantages of higher spatial resolution than possible with
              radar and also greater precision in velocity measurement.  The goal is to
              construct high-resolution maps of the horizontal pattern of the wind in the
              atmospheric boundary layer within a range of several kilometers from the lidar.
               The instrument to be used in the experiments is the new high-resolution
              Doppler lidar (HRDL) developed at the Environmental Technology Laboratory of
              NOAA; the analysis method is the algorithm for wind and temperature retrieval
              developed at NCAR.  Collaborating with Dr. Newsom will be Dr. Robert Banta of
              ETL and Dr. Juanzhen Sun of NCAR.  As part of the project, the lidar will be
              operated during the CASES-99 boundary-layer project of October 1999.  The
              observations will provide detailed data on airflow for application to studies
              of turbulence and eddy transports in the boundary layer and to the
              initialization and verification of large eddy simulations.
