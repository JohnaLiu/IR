General Circulation
              Models (GCMs)  predict that the Arctic will be the first place to feel
              significant impacts from global change.  The resolution of GCMs in the Arctic,
              however, is too coarse to resolve regional variations in climate.  This
              research project will use a statistical method to downscale coarse resolution
              GCM output so that it can be used to force regional scale ecosystem models. 
              Existing data (including Russian) and downscaled model extrapolations will be
              used to examine the variability of temperature and precipitation, especially
              with respect to regional topographic changes that are known to drive regional
              climate variability.  This study will make available a climate study on a
              regional scale that can be used by other researchers to examine the assessments
              of the impact of climate change on the Arctic.
