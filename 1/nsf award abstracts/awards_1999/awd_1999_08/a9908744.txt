              ABSTRACT

AST-9808744
Tsuruta, Sachiko

Partial support is provided for a
              meeting held at the Montana State University in the summer of 1999.  The focus
              of the workshop is on evaluating the progress that has been made in recent
              years in the study of the physical mechanisms responsible for high-energy
              emission from astrophysical plasmas.  Particular emphasis is given to
              observational and theoretical problems related to accreting systems, neutron
              stars and black holes, the Sun, supernovae, gamma ray bursts, soft gamma
              repeaters and the early universe.

The NSF will provide support for the
              travel expenses of several invited speakers and junior scientists.
