The investigators will study the reflectivity
              structure of polar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE) and its relation to the wind
              field.  PMSE have been put forth as a possible precursor of global climate
              change due to their possible connection to anthropogenic modification of the
              atmosphere.  The study will be conducted through a collaboration between the U.
              of Nebraska and the Atmospheric Research Programme of the Swedish Institute of
              Space Physics, which operates a mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere radar in
              Kiruna Sweden.  The radar's six independent receiving channels allow the
              implementation of coherent imaging techniques to create almost instantaneous
              pictures of the reflectivity structure of the atmosphere. The images of PMSE
              structure will be compared and contrasted to the three-dimensional wind field
              measurements obtained using spaced antenna techniques.  The vertical component
              of the wind field is believed to be important in the creation of PMSE due to
              the expansional cooling effects of rising air.
