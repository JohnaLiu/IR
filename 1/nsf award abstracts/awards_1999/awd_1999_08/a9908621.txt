This US-Brazil dissertation enhancement research proposal was
              submitted by Mr. Kevin A. Feldheim of the University of Illinois, Chicago,
              under the sponsorship of Dr. Mary V. Ashley.  Mr. Feldheim will work with a
              group of Brazilian collaborators, led by Dr. Ricardo Rosa of Universidade
              Federal da Paraiba, Brazil.  Their research involves the population genetic
              analysis of the Lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, at Atol des Rocas and
              Fernando de Naronha, Brazil.  Atol des Rocas is a biological reserve; Fernando
              de Naronha is a Brazilian National Marine Park.
This dissertation research is
              part of a larger, on-going project funded in part by the U.S.-Brazil Program,
              led by the U.S. researcher, Dr. Samuel Gruber of the University of Miami.  The
              goal of this work is to investigate the life history and mating system of the
              lemon shark found at Atol des Rocas and Fernando de Narohna off the coast of
              Brazil. The researchers will use two high resolution molecular DNA markers
              (microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA) to characterize parentage and
              relatedness of a large sample of adult and juvenile lemon sharks that they will
              collect at the two sites.  They will compare their data with that collected
              from another population off Bimini, Bahamas, to answer questions about this
              species mating system and basic breeding biology.  Increased knowledge of this
              species will aid in its conservation.
