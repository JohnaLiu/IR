The Principal Investigator will determine the
              mechanisms and pathways for the transport of particle-reactive contaminants
              from the Barents Sea continental shelf into the deep Arctic Ocean basin.  He
              will track the plutonium tracer signal emanating from the former nuclear test
              site of Chernaya Bay, on the south coastline of Novaya Zemlya, into the Arctic
              Ocean.  The large (11 TBq) inventory of plutonium in Chernaya Bay, derived from
              underwater nuclear tests in the 1950s, is characterized by low 240Pu /239Pu 
              ratios of 0.03 which provide an easily measured contrast (using ICP-MS
              techniques) to values of 0.18, typical of atmospheric fallout.  Surficial
              sediments in the Makarov and Eurasian Basins have low 240Pu /239Pu ratios
              (0.09-0.16) and it is hypothesized that a significant component of this
              plutonium is the result of long-range transport from Chernaya Bay.  The
              Principal Investigator will evaluate the north transport of Chernaya Bay
              plutonium by following the low 240Pu /239Pu  ratio signal in sediment box-core
              samples collected on transects across the pathway of the plutonium plume west
              of Novaya Zemlya and in the Saint Anna Trough. The sediment samples will be
              analyzed for a complete suite of radionuclides (210lead, 137cesium,
              241americum, 239 plutonium, 240plutonium) to establish sedimentation and mixing
              rates at each location and in order to evaluate the plutonium fluxes and
              inventories.  These results will be supported by hydrodynamic modeling of
              radionuclide propagation, both in dissolved and particulate phases, along the
              west coast of Novaya Zemlya and into the Eurasian Basin.  The initial
              radionuclide measurements will be conducted on archived sediment samples stored
              at the Byrd Polar Research Center.  Additional samples will be collected on
              transects across the elaborated plume pathway during the second year.  The
              results of this study will provide a basis for assessing the impact of
              potential radionuclide releases from a new radioactive waste storage facility
              to be constructed on the south coast of Novaya Zemlya.  These results will help
              in predicting the magnitude of inorganic and organic particle-reactive
              contaminant transport through the Arctic Ocean from a wide range of urban and
              industrial sources located on the arctic continental shelf.
