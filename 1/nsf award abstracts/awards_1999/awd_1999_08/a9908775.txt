This proposal is for systematic studies of
              geocoronal Balmer-alpha line profiles to investigate the detailed behavior of
              cascade and other possible excitation mechanisms in addition to direct
              Lyman-beta excitation.  For the first time coincident observation of geocoronal
              hydrogen Balmer-alpha and Balmer-beta line profiles will be made using two high
              resolution Fabry-Perot annular summing spectrometers located at the Pine Bluff
              Observatory near Madison, WI.  The Balmer-alpha and Balmer-beta line profiles
              are composed of different fine structures, but are affected by the same
              exospheric kinematics.  Comparison of both sets of observations with solar
              Lyman line radiative transfer modeling will facilitate isolation of signatures
              in the line profile due to kinematics from those due to cascade or other
              excitation mechanisms.

The potential for future coincident observations with
              instruments aboard the TIMED satellite could yield a very comprehensive body of
              consistently calibrated geocoronal Balmer-alpha, Balmer-beta, and Lyman-alpha
              emission data, along with their solar excitation fluxes, and lead to a new
              level of understanding of the physics of the hydrogen geocorona.
