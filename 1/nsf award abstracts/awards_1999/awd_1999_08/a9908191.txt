Abstract    :
              This three-year project is a series of five interrelated activities designed to
              enhance the Advanced Technological Education program, to encourage the
              development of ATE-related programs in more community colleges, and to make
              known to the education field and the public the accomplishments of these
              programs.  The activities build on the successes of previous efforts of the
              American Association of Community Colleges (AACC). They support the emerging
              network of community colleges dedicated to improving undergraduate science,
              mathematics, engineering and technology education.  Most importantly, the
              activities aim to enrich and expand the current network of colleges and schools
              in the forefront of reform, to offer recommendations for finding solutions to
              challenging areas, and to disseminate information about successful programs and
              their national significance.  

The project activities are:  
     (a) 
              Three National ATE Conferences in 1999, 2000, and 2001,
     (b) 
              Dissemination of information about ATE programs and goals through
          
              AACC publications, presentations, feature stories, conference
          
              proceedings, a listserv, and a Web page,
     (c)  An AACC ATE Mentoring
              Program to help community colleges strengthen
           science, mathematics,
              engineering, and technology programs,
     (d) Two AACC Research Briefs 
              addressing areas of interest to all   
           community colleges seeking
              to sustain strong science, mathematics,
           engineering, and technology
              programs, and
     (e)  Evaluation.
