Abstract    :
              In the last decade, considerable progress has been made in applying the
              technology of microelectronics fabrication to mechanical construction.  This
              field has come to be referred to as MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems), and
              the devices produced by these technologies are usually nearly planar, having
              dimensions in the vertical direction of only a few micrometers.  This drawback
              has led to limited success for these devices as sensors and almost no success
              for these devices as actuators and mechanisms. To many researchers and
              practitioners it appears plausible that three-dimensional meso and micro scale
              systems will have a much wider range of application than the so-called MEMS
              devices.  Because of the expected growth in many manufacturing areas and what
              is perceived as a critical need to focus research attention and to develop
              insights into future directions and applications of three-dimensional micro and
              meso scale devices, a workshop will be conducted at and jointly with the
              National Institute of Science and Technology on May 18 and 19, 1999. The
              purpose of this workshop is to bring together leading industrial and academic
              researchers and practitioners of micro and meso scale manufacturing for the
              purpose of identifying processes, measurement methods, targets of opportunity,
              application areas, and other unforeseen points relevant to this emerging
              discipline.
