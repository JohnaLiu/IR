Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to study the impregnation of metal complexes on
              high surface-area supports.  Modeling and experimental studies on the
              adsorption of selected metal complexes on several supports will be carried out.
               In previous work the Revised Physical Adsorption (RPA) model was successfully
              applied to hexachloroplatinate on alumina.  In this project the generality of
              the model to other types of metal complexes and other common oxide supports
              will be tested.  A series of metals and supports will be tested to isolate the
              effects of pertinent parameters such as the oxide point of zero charge  and the
              dielectric constant.  The model will be tested for its applicability to
              catalysis.  Although a model of the adsorption step is useful, it must be
              determined to what degree the initial deposition of metal is maintained as a
              function of drying and catalyst pretreatment.  Predictions from the model
              indicate that platinum complexes are deposited as a monolayer on the oxide
              surface.  The extent to which platinum particles agglomerate or migrate as the
              hydration sheaths and ligands are removed by chemical and thermal treatments
              will be quantified.  This work is potentially applicable to catalysis and the
              removal of heavy metals from water streams.
