Dr. Ram S. Lamba's
              contributions to the science education enterprise have been significant with
              far reaching impact on the science, mathematics and engineering curriculum and
              related activities.  His mentoring spans a lifetime having mentored students at
              the pre-college, undergraduate and graduate levels.  Dr. Lamba's efforts
              include: teacher enhancement projects; revitalization of the undergraduate
              chemistry curriculum to promote student learning through laboratory
              instruction; computer interactive laboratories as a tool for redesigning
              laboratory experiences; development of locally produced laboratory
              instrumentation for the pre-college and undergraduate levels; and, infusion of
              technology into the teaching of science.  Dr. Lamba's mentees include nine
              university science professors and over 500 science teachers.
