CALDER

The purpose of this award is to transfer funds to
              NOAA for the initial support of the new International Arctic Research Center
              (IARC) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.  IARC is expected to greatly
              enhance research in the Arctic and to facilitate research with many other
              organizations.

The IARC has identified eight broad themes as the framework
              of its program: (I) Detection of contemporary change, (II) Paleoclimatic and
              paleoenvironmental reconstructions of past changes, (III) Interactions and
              feedbacks that affect change, (IV) Atmospheric chemistry of the arctic region,
              (V) Impacts and consequences of change, (VI) Solar influences on global
              change/space weather prediction, (VII) Climate change caused by tectonic
              activities, and (VIII) Integration of (I)-(VII) on a regional scale.
