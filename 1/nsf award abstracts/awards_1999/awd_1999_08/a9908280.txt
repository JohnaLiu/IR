This award establishes the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Water Quality at
              the University of Arizona.  The Center will focus on water quality because
              potable water supplies in the Southwest USA and many other areas of the U.S.
              are threatened by chemical and biological contaminants.  The Center's research
              program will address the influence of the following areas:  pathogen detection
              and elimination; fate and remediation of commercial/industrial contamination;
              waste reuse; agro-chemical products that affect water quality; and mining.  The
              industrial participants include:  water utility companies, state agencies,
              chemical, agro-chemical and mining companies.
