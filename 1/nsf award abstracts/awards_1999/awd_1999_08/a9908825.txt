This U.S.-Mexico award will support a workshop on precise
              and synchronized measurement techniques in power systems.  The workshop,
              organized by Dr. Jaime De La Ree of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
              University and Dr. Hector Altuve of the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon in
              Monterrey, Mexico, will gather experts from universities, electric utilities,
              and research institutions to promote an exchange of ideas, experiences, and
              applications of new technologies to power systems.

Weakly interconnected
              systems, systems under stress, low margin systems, and longitudinal systems are
              all special problems to system engineers. Reductions in power plant
              construction as well as continuous increases in system loads are leading to
              system stresses with the possibility of more system disturbances and possible
              brown- or blackouts. On the other hand, advances in microprocessor technology,
              fast and reliable communication systems, and computer-based monitoring
              equipment have increased the capacity to record and analyze system events,
              obtain important information about system behavior under transient or stressed
              conditions, and develop new protection and control schemes to improve existing
              power systems.  Experiences attained by field engineers and researchers in
              Mexico can be of great value to researchers and power industry engineers of the
              U.S., particularly since the advent of the North American Free Trade Agreement
              (NAFTA) requires closer coordination and tie-ins among electric power utilities
              of both countries.
