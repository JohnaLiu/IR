Abstract    :
              
This equipment award from the Engineering Research Centers Program provides
              funding to the Engineering Research Center on Reconfigurable Machining Systems
              at the University of Michigan to build as proof-of-concept a new type of CNC
              machine, called the Reconfigurable Machine Tool (RMT).  The RMT has two new
              characteristics:  a spindle until that can be added and subtracted from the
              machine in response to changing demand and design features that are built
              around a part family to allow cost-effective response to product changes.  The
              ERC holds a patent on this RMT design.  The RMT will be used for machinin a
              part family that contains angled surfaces.  This novel 3-axis RMT machine will
              have the following characteristics:  the angle of the cutting tool will be
              perpendicular to the angled machined-surfaced of the part, the angle of the
              cutting tool will be adjustable to fit a new part with a different angled
              surface, and an additional second spindle unit could be integrated into an
              existing machine in order to double the production rate of the machine exactly
              when needed.  The RMT has been designed as a part of the ERC's research on
              machine-level design.  This proof-of-concept RMT will be used by faculty and
              students for further research in the design of reconfigurable machine tools and
              in the ERC's test bed for systems-level design.  The ERC is providing cost
              sharing for this equipment request in the amount of $120,000.
