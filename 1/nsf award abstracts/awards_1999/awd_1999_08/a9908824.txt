This Pan-American Advanced Study Institute award, jointly
              supported by the NSF and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), on "Atoms and
              Molecules in a New Light", proposes to bring together a number of senior
              researchers and young scientists from the Americas, at the advanced graduate
              and postgraduate level, to learn of new ideas and developments in atomic,
              molecular, and optical physics.  It is expected that discussions among the
              participants will help to establish new collaborations between scientists in
              the countries of the Americas, stimulating training, cooperation and new
              research initiatives for the 21st century.

The proposed course of lectures,
              seminars and discussions builds on strengths of the atomic, molecular, quantum
              optical and, to some extent, chemical communities centered around the use of
              large research tools already doing research in Latin America.  In particular,
              emphasis will be given to cooperation and collaboration between the synchrotron
              light sources in Campinas (Brazil) and Berkeley (California).  The Institute
              will help spread awareness of particular strengths and facilities throughout
              the hemisphere, so that mutually beneficial collaborations can be
              initiated.

The institute will feature four areas of atomic, molecular and
              optical physics, areas that are interrelated in content, and, in some cases,
              technique as well.  The four areas will involve studies using synchrotron
              radiation, lasers,  electron and ion beams, and efforts based on quantum
              optical effects, in particular quantum computing with ion traps.
