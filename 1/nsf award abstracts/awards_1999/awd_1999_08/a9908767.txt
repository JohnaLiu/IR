Abstract    :
              PI:  Cosby, Philip

The PI proposes to study the fundamental
              foundation for the extraction of mesospheric temperatures from OH Meinel band
              spectra.  The extensive historical record of Meinel band observations provides
              a unique data set for monitoring global change in a region of the atmosphere
              where changes may be the most dramatic.  Inconsistency in results from the
              historical record of one site to another complicate concrete conclusions from
              OH emission measurements.

To nightglow spectrum used in this initial
              analysis is the sum of hundreds of individual spectra acquired by 14 groups
              observing stars or quasars with the HIRES echelle spectrometer on the Keck 1
              telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, over a period from December 1994 through May
              1997.  The spectrum covers the wavelength range from 573 to 893 nm, with total
              accumulation time in excess of 100 hours on this optically fast  instrument. 
              The PI proposes to analyze the individual spectra that comprise this highly
              averaged sum, characterizing the Meinel band emission together with the O2 0-1
              atmospheric band emission with regard to seasons, intense and weak nights, and
              other pertinent sorting criteria to determine how best to relate the apparent
              OH rotational temperature from a specific band to the average thermal energy of
              the mesosphere at the altitude of the emission.
