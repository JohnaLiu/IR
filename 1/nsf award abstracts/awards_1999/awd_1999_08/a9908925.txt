The research will explore the physical factors that affect the
              durability of elastomeric components, such as large deformation, conversion of
              mechanical energy to heat, heat transfer, and changes in material properties
              due to changes in microstructure. The first component of the experimental
              program will be to characterize the thermal and mechanical properties using
              coupon specimens subjected to cyclic uniaxial and multiaxial deformations under
              different ambient conditions. The evolution of microstructural changes as
              functions of the mechanical and thermal histories will be of particular
              interest. Subsequent experiments will focus on non-homogeneous deformation and
              temperature fields and their correlation to the degradation of mechanical
              properties. The studies will provide the necessary data for the development and
              validation of mathematical models for rubber thermo-viscoelasticity, heat
              generation and microstructural changes and lead to the development of realistic
              and accurate life and durability predictive models.
