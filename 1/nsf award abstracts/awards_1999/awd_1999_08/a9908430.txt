Three fundamental aspects of liquid-saturated particle flows,
              with the overall purpose of improving predictability of concentrated
              suspensions, will be investigated.  First, the particle-wall and
              particle-particle collisions in the presence of an interstitial viscous fluid
              will be experimentally studied using an immersed pendulum.  The role of the
              impact Reynolds number, solid-fluid density ratio, and particle restitution
              coefficients will be evaluated.  Second, particle pressure by collisions and
              solid velocity fluctuations in fluidized bed and gravitational flow will be
              measured and suitable correlations will be established.  Third, the response of
              vibrated beds of particles in liquids as the acceleration and frequency is
              varied will be evaluated by using the concepts developed in the first two parts
              of the project.  
If successful, the research will lead to better
              understanding of dense liquid-solid particle system flows with application in
              particle processing industries and environment.
