Abstract    :
              
The Principal Investigators will investigate the impact of persistent organic
              pollutants (POPs) exposure on critical tissue functions and performance
              characteristics of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus).  Many Arctic fish have
              very high concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in their tissues,
              but very little is known about their impact of PCBs.  Anadromous Arctic char,
              those fish which migrate to the ocean in spring for feeding and growth,
              accumulate PCBs from the ocean.  During their winter residence in the
              freshwater lakes, the fish do not feed, but mobilize energy substrates for
              gonadal development.  Consequently, the PCBs accumulated in lipid depots are
              mobilized and there is a re-distribution of PCBs to other tissues.  Therefore,
              Arctic char presents a unique ecologically relevant model to test the impact of
              PCB re-distribution during a critical phase i.e., gonadal maturation and
              seawater migration, on the performance characteristics of the fish.
