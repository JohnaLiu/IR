Abstract    :
              The investigators will conduct a design study for a relocatable atmospheric
              observatory consisting of a high-power, phased-array, incoherent scatter radar.
               Current technology has allowed a significant change in the design of modern
              incoherent scatter radars and offers the possibility of a relocatable system. 
              The use of distributed solid state power amplifiers enables designs that are
              modular, easy to upgrade as technology advances, and reconfigurable.  The study
              will determine the best design approach, including an evaluation of tradeoffs
              in transportability, cost, and capabilities.  The proposed work also includes
              construction of a prototype radar which will be assembled, operated,
              dismantled, reassembled, and operated again to test the relocatable aspects of
              the design.  The results of the design study will provide the basic
              specifications of the final system and cost estimates for initial construction
              and relocation.  Besides being the basis for a relocatable observatory, these
              new radar units may be the technology upon which all future incoherent scatter
              radars are based.  The current U.S. incoherent scatter radars are all based on
              WWII technology, and the hardware and engineering expertise needed to maintain
              them are becoming harder to find.  These new, low-power units could prove to be
              the wave of the future for these important atmospheric sciences facilities.
