A three year effort is proposed to theoretically
              investigate the energetics and potential global effects of the breakdown
              ionization regions associated with spectacular luminous glows occurring in
              clear air above thunderstorms (sprites).

The purpose of the proposed
              research is to determine the temporal dynamics of energy transfer from
              lightning generated quasi-electrostatic fields into rotational, vibrational,
              electronic, and chemical energy of atmospheric molecules, resulting in optical
              (ultraviolet to infrared) emission, and to estimate the consequences of this
              deposited energy on the thermal and chemical balance of the D-region on a
              global scale.  Recent experimental and theoretical findings indicate that the
              further development of understanding of energetics and phenomenology of sprite
              phenomena requires the inclusion of non-local and non-stationary effects of
              energetics runaway electrons on the dynamics and optical properties of the
              electrical breakdown above thunderstorms.  The PIs will develop a comprehensive
              two-dimensional Monte Carlo particle model to treat effects of suprathermal
              runaway electrons on the development of the electrical breakdown in different
              altitude ranges.  To answer outstanding scientific questions and to compare the
              model results with sprite observations the PIs will link their sprite models
              with available state-of-the-art D region chemistry, radiative transfer and
              infrared radiation models.
