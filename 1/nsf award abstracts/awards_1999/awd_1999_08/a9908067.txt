Geosynthetics, polymeric sheets used to improve earth
              behavior, are an
important part of cost-effective civil engineering.
              Geosynthetics include
geotextiles, geomembranes and many erosion control
              materials. All are used
extensively in landfills to protect the environment.
              The development and use of
geosynthetics has been very rapid; so rapid, in
              fact, that the transfer of
knowledge and experiences from designing and
              installing geosynthetics has not
kept up with the rapid expansion of the
              market. The result is needless
failures. If the experience of others had been
              shared and publicized, in a
common document, many failures could have been
              avoided. This is especially true
in the use of geosynthetics, particularly
              geomembranes, in landfills.

A workshop with resulting documents is proposed.
              Non-partisan
experts in
the use of landfill geomembranes will attend and
              share experiences in an open
environment. They will discuss current problems
              and focus on better solutions.
The workshop title is Geomembrane testing and
              remediation technologies -
testing
of geomembrane materials, seams, and
              installed lining systems, and the repair
of leaks in the latter.

       
              The workshop goals are:

1.      develop a state-of-practice paper 
2.     
              provide a vision for the profession on where new knowledge/research is
       
               needed on this subject and how to get it
3.      provide a model for other
              organizations (such as the ASCE
Geo-Institute)
to hold similar
              workshops/brainstorming sessions.

        After the state-of-practice paper
              ((1) above) is complete, ten expert
professionals will attend a 2.5-day
              workshop at Auburn University in Auburn,
AL, to share experiences and discuss
              the needs of the profession in this area.
The meeting results will be a paper
              on the needs of the profession on the
subject for the coming five years.
