Abstract    :
              This award supports the activities of the Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of
              the Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) Science Steering Committee (CSSC).  The CSSC is
              composed of representatives from the atmospheric sciences community appointed
              by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and provides a formal mechanism for
              communication between the community and the NSF's Aeronomy and Upper
              Atmospheric Facilities Programs.  The CSSC helps set the direction and agenda
              for the CEDAR program and coordinates the program's activities with other
              national and international programs.  The nominal activities of the CSSC are:
              (1) to convene the annual CEDAR workshop in Boulder, Colorado each June and to
              meet at NSF each fall; and (2) to publish the CEDAR newsletter three times per
              year.  Specific tasks over the next two years include the implementation and
              initiation of collaborative studies with the NASA TIMED Satellite Program and
              conducting a contiguous CEDAR-STP symposium in June 2001.  This proposal
              requests funds to support the CSSC's activities over the next two years.
