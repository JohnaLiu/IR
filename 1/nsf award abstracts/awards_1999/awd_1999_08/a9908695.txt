Abstract    :
              This is a project to conduct a one-year passive seismic experiment in the
              Galapagos Islands.  The proponents will deploy an array of 10 broadband
              seismometer, which together with the existing stations will provide a total of
              14 stations on the Islands.  This survey will address the following objectives:
               determine if the Galapagos hotspot is associated with a deep mantle plume, and
              if so, map its deptn extent down to the 660-km discontinuity, determine the
              locus of the center of upwelling beneath the Galapagos hotspot, and constrain
              the first-order form of hotspot-lithosphere interaction beneath the Island
              platform.
