This grant funds research leading to a doctoral
              dissertation in Linguistics. The dissertation will consist primarily of a
              detailed description and analysis of the phonology of Betta Kurumba,
              supplemented with a description of its morphology. Betta Kurumba is a Dravidian
              language spoken by fewer than 1000 people in the Nilgiri Mountains (also called
              the Nilgiris) in southern India.

The project is expected to have
              significance for (a) the documentation and description of Betta Kurumba, a
              language on which insufficient research has been done so far; (b) an
              understanding of the similarities and differences among phonological systems in
              the world's diverse languages, by contributing a case study of one language;
              (c) documentation of the oral literature of an indigenous ethnic group in the
              Nilgiris; and (d) the promotion of language maintenance and native-language
              literacy among members of a minority ethnic group.

Project work involves a
              year of field research in Theppakadu, a region in the Nilgiris where a
              substantial number of the Betta Kurumba community live. The data gathered will
              consist of elicited lists of Betta Kurumba words and sentences, as well as
              stories and naturally occurring conversations in Betta Kurumba. The data will
              be primarily recorded through audio-tapes, but supplementary video-tape
              recordings of natural discourse in conversations, story-telling sessions, and
              ceremonial rituals will also be made as an aid for analysis and
              documentation.
