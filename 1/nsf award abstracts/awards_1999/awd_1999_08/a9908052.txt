Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a two-year collaborative project between the NSF
              Engineering Research Center (ERC) at Mississippi State University on
              Computational Field Simulation and the Computational Combustion Laboratory at
              the Georgia Institute of Technology.  This project will develop
              state-of-the-art large-eddy simulation (LES) techniques for non-equilibrium,
              reactive fluid flows, implement these models into a state-of-the-art computer
              code being developed at the ERC, validate the physical accuracy of the
              resulting simulations by comparison with benchmark calculations and
              experimental data, and visualize the physics and processes involved.  This
              effort brings together expertise developed at the ERC in high-performance
              computing and numerical techniques for reactive flows with the knowledge
              developed at Georgia Tech in turbulence modeling, large-eddy simulation, and
              combustion simulation.  The LES capabilities will be added in a computationally
              efficient manner with the Loci framework being developed at the ERC.  Loci is a
              C++ library that implements a specification system for the development of
              unstructured numerical applications.
