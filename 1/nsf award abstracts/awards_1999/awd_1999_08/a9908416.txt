Title:
              Coring in San Francisco Bay to Obtain A Record of Paleo-Streamflow from the
              Last Interglacial

This SGER award supports coring and preliminary dating and
              analysis of cored sediments, and to test the feasibility of using last
              interglacial estuarine sediments, and to derive a record of paleo-streamflow
              and environmental change in San Francisco Bay.  Recent investigations of San
              Francisco Bay paleosalinity using isotopic compositions of fossil mollusk
              shells from sediments cores, reveal significant variations in inflow on
              decadal-to century-time scales during the late Holocene.  The salinity trends
              indicate that extended periods were much wetter, and others much drier, than
              the present time.  A high-resolution study is important to detect decadal- to
              century-scale changes in the Bay related to climate fluctuations.
