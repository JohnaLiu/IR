	This project
              tracks the growth and development of international non-governmental
              humanitarian organizations (INGO's). These organizations sometimes shape social
              change and influence culture independent of, or even in competition with,
              political organizations in the countries affected. Yet these international
              relief organizations, which have grown rapidly in number since the end of World
              War II, are not well understood in terms of their interactions with political
              and cultural forces in the countries where they are present. This project
              begins by enumerating the founding and growth of all such organizations,
              classifying various aspects of their structure and function. Next a sub-sample
              of organizations will be selected in which changes since founding will be
              documented. The project will assess hypotheses derived from theories of world
              culture and world economic systems.
