Abstract    :
              9908393 Saran.  Industrial problems, due to their complexity, are
typically
              very sensitive with respect to variations of design
parameters.  This is
              particularly so in a nonlinear range of behavior. 
This research will address
              the problem in an accurate quantitative way,
based on underlying theories of
              solid mechanics, systems sensitivity,
and optimization. Starting from the same
              rigorous solid mechanics
equations as in deformation analysis, a broader
              problem is formulated,
where the design parameters can vary.  Thus, not only
              the basic
response, but also the resulting variation of the response
              (system
robustness) to the variations of the selected system parameters, can
              be
calculated.  As a result, the proposed numerical tool will modify
              the
design variables to obtain the most robust final design.  We consider
              a
large and industrially important class of problems that can be described
by
              a geometrically and materially nonlinear analysis of deformable
bodies subject
              to any loading including transient loading with inertia
effects taken into
              account.  Possible applications include metal
forming, crashworthiness, and
              various impact problems.***
