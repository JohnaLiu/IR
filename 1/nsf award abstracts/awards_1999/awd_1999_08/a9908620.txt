Abstract    :
              This grant supports a workshop to define a new research area called
              "computational topology".  The workshop will bring together about 20 research
              leaders from a variety of fields, such as topology, computational geometry,
              statistical learning, computer graphics, computer-aided design and
              manufacturing, and physical simulation.  Currently each of these fields has its
              own approach to shape.  It is believed that computational topology can unify
              these approaches, and help develop principled, robust algorithms for creating,
              describing, and manipulating shapes.
