Abstract    :
              This project will extend the limits of current optical production techniques for
              complex (e.g. diffractive and aspheric), ultraprecise optical components
              produced in large volume (e.g. molded plastic optics).  This will be
              accomplished by combining the expertise of three organizations: the Precision
              Engineering Center at North Carolina State University, the Precision
              Engineering Research Laboratory at Boston University, and Shape Global
              Technology.  The capability of replicated plastic components into new
              applications such as display technology and high-end camera optics will be
              significantly extended.  Microlens arrays for large flat panel displays are
              currently limited to about 300 mm whereas SLR camera lenses of 50 mm require an
              order of magnitude better dimensional tolerance than currently possible with
              molded optics.  To achieve this objective will require improvements to mold
              fabrication techniques, new and/or improved molding processes, and material
              advances.  The project tasks will include material studies in new molding
              strategies on a modern injection molding machine provided by Shape Global
              Technology, improvements in mold fabrication processes, and a study of the
              relationship between mold shape and replicated plastic components.  

The
              development of techniques and tools in this project to measure, control, and
              fabricate photonic components to more exacting standards should help the U.S.
              to maintain its lead in critical photonics manufacturing technologies.
