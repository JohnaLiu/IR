Abstract    :
              Fletcher.9908594

The nature of coastal change occurring over the time frame
              of decades to millennia, a period that is highly relevant to human concerns, is
              poorly understood.  For instance, scientists do not have even a rudimentary
              understanding of how interannual processes govern sediment sharing across the
              littoral energy fence.  What is the repeatability  (or variation) of states of
              stability or change on the inter-decadal scale?  What are the temporal and
              spatial characteristics of physical processes that link the shoreline to the
              inner shelf on the century to millennial scale?  Which of these nested time
              scales is responsible for the greatest amount of work in determining the fate
              of coastal sediments and the character of the shoreline system at any moment in
              time?  An improved ability to effectively answer these questions, an others,
              will be critically valuable to the coastal planning community, permitting
              authorities, and resource managers. This proposal seeks participant support
              funding and logistical funding to defray the cost of holding a research
              conference and planning workshop of international scientists active in the
              broad field of coastal geology.  The principal focus of the workshop is the
              Quaternary sedimentological history of sea-level changes and shoreline and
              inner shelf sedimentological processes and their past and future impact on
              society and human issues.  The conference will convene November 9-12, 1999 on
              the campus of the University of Hawaii, Honolulu.
