This continuing grant funds the second five (5)
              years (in accordance with Announcement NSF 97-164) of the multi-university
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Software
              Engineering.  The I/UCRC at Purdue University is adding a research site at West
              Virginia University.

The I/UCRC's research agenda addresses:  1.)
              Reliability Predicition in Early Design, 2.) Data Quality, 3.) Testing
              Distributed Systems, 4.) Software Evolution, 5.) Integration of Software
              Process Models and Metrics, 6.) Spotlighting the  Code: A SERC Technology
              Development and Transfer Project, 7.) Metrics Directed Verification of Motorola
              SDL Designs, 8.) Managing Consistency in Software Specifications, 9.) An
              Integrated Cost Model for Software Reuse: Design and Implementation, 10.)
              Requirements Validation Using Specification Animation and 11.) Tool Support for
              the Development of Pattern-oriented Design Frameworks.
