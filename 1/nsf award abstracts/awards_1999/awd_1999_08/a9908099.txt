Abstract    :
              A workshop on Process Systems Engineering will take place in Santa Fe,
              Argentina, on September 2-3, 1999. This workshop will involve the participation
              of 23 researchers from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the US and concentrate in
              the areas of process design and process operations.  Aside from promoting the
              exchange of ideas, the goal of the workshop is to promote collaboration between
              US and South American researchers.  This workshop will take place in parallel
              with another workshop in the area of catalysis.  US academic researchers will
              be supported to atted the workshop in Santa Fe.  Several of the US participants
              will also participate in the enpromer '99 II Mercosul Process Engineering
              Congress that will take place in Florianopolis on August 31 - September 1,
              1999.  This meeting, which addresses topics in process engineering, will
              involve about 300 participants for the Mercosur group (Argentina, Brazil,
              Chile, and Uruguay).  The proposed workshop and participation at the Enpromer
              meeting are part of the activities that the CEPAC (Chemical Engineering Pan
              America Collaboraiton) group has planned for 1999.
