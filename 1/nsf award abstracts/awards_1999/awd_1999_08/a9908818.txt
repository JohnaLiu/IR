This is a proposal requesting consideration for a Small Grant
              for Exploratory Research (SGER) award. This proposal describes a one-year
              activity in which the PI will conduct investigations on secure information
              systems tailored to optoelectronic and optical systems by taking the advantage
              of the parallelism, large bandwidth and interconnections of optics.  By
              properly encoding of secure data using optoelectronic A/D and interferometric
              methods, the encrypted data can be sent over the optical or electronic networks
              securely. Multi-dimensional keys using many degrees of freedom in optics
              increases the number of mathematical possibilities to break a code. Potential
              applications include protection of information assets, database security,
              personal verification and identification from remote sites, document security
              and surveillance. The proposed work is to demonstrate the feasibility of the
              optical encoding techniques.
