Abstract    :
                   This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will perform a
              feasibility study on the design of hybrid kinematic machines.  The goal of the
              design is to attain the advantages of both a serial kinematic machine and a
              parallel kinematic machine including:  (1) High-stiffness, low inertia, and
              high-speed capability, (2) Decoupled position and orientation tasks,  (3)
              Closed-form direct and inverse kinematics, (4) Simplified dynamical equations
              and control algorithm, 5) Large workspace (in comparison with a
              6-degree-of-freedom fully parallel kinematic machine), and (6) Modular and
              reconfigurable machine architecture.  First, two different classes of position
              mechanisms, one with three and the other with four supporting limbs, will be
              enumerated.  Then, a comparison study of the machine stiffness, inertia, and
              workspace volume will be made.
     This project is expected to advance the
              fundamental knowledge for design of high-stiffness, low-inertia, and high-speed
              precision machine tools.  The knowledge base developed by this work will not
              only benefit the machine tool industry but also the robotics community.
