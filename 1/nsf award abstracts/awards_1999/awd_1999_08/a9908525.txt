Abstract    :
                   This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will investigate a
              novel approach to driving CNC machines directly from the analytic descriptions
              of paths based on the use of Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves. The principal
              goal of this exploratory study is to give a practical demonstration of the
              advantages of PH curve interpolator algorithms by implementing and testing them
              within the framework of a commercial open-architecture CNC software product. 
              The MDSI OpenCNC system will be used for this purpose. The performance of the
              PH curve CNC interpolators in terms of positional accuracy, feedrate
              smoothness, continuously-variable feedrate capability, and other
              characteristics will be compared with both linear/circular G code part programs
              and approximate Bezier/B-spline interpolation algorithms.
     The PH curves
              incorporate a special algebraic structure, which renders them well suited to
              real-time processing by open-architecture CNC interpolators and controllers. 
              In addition to bypassing the need for intermediate linear/circular tool path
              approximations, PH curves offer a new ability to drive CNC machines at
              continuously-varying feedrates. This project offers the potential for very
              significant performance improvements in CNC machines.
