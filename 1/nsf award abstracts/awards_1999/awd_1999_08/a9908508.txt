Abstract    :
              Harold Deutschman
New Jersey Institute of Technology

Dr. Deutschman has a
              distinguished record over the past twenty-nine years initiating pre-college
              programs, teaching and directing such programs and mentoring students to enter
              college and pursue careers in science, mathematics and engineering.  A summer
              engineering program for 9th and 10th graders initiated by Dr. Deutschman in
              1970 has run continuously for twenty-nine years.  He has mentored over 2,500
              students averaging 100 students per year. These students have been
              predominately underrepresented minority students from the Greater Newark area. 
              Over 95% of Dr. Deutschman's mentees have enrolled in college and 70% have
              majored in science, mathematics or engineering.
