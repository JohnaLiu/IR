Abstract    :
              This study addresses emissions from burning certain waste fuels (plastics,
              fabrics, etc.) found in medical and municipal wastes.  Pollutants studied
              include polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particulate matter (PM),
              volatile organic carbon (VOC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), 
              oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).  Using sequential
              investigation of increasingly complex fuels, experiments and theory address
              premixed combustion, pollutant formation and interaction, and remedial
              technologies such as secondary furnaces (afterburners) and hot flue-gas
              filtration.  Fuels include gaseous styrene, clouds of polystyrene particles,
              polystyrene pellets, surgical latex gloves and sterile cotton pads.  Direct
              measurement of  combustion products in the afterburner allows correlation of
              particulate carbon, carbon monoxide, and soot and elucidates the mechanism for
              removal of particulate carbon.  Simultaneous development of a chemical kinetic
              model gives a tool for design and operation of hospital-waste incinerators and
              municipal waste-to-energy facilities.
