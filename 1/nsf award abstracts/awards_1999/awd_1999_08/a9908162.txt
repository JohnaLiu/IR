This award supports twenty participants to attend the fifth
              annual German-American Frontiers of Science Symposium (GAFOS) to be held in
              Potsdam, Germany, June 10-13, 1999.  The grantee organization is the
              German-American Academic Council (GAAC).  The GAAC was founded March 26, 1993
              by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Bill Clinton.  The National
              Academy of Sciences hosts and provides staff support for the U.S. branch of the
              GAAC.  NSF has also funded the domestic Frontiers of Science Symposia.
The
              GAFOS is designed to bring together the best young researchers from Germany and
              the United States to hear lectures and engage in discussions on cutting edge
              issues in science and engineering, and possible future development.  The
              Symposia not only bring together researchers from the two countries, but also
              researchers from different disciplines in the expectation of being able to
              apply techniques of problem solving from one field to other fields.
