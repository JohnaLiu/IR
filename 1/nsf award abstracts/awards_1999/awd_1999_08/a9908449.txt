This project is to support a workshop and synthetic
              research addressing the nature of Arctic biodiversity.  The Arctic biotic
              environment is increasingly characterized in terms of its biodiversity: the
              range, variety, variability, stability, and interactions of Arctic species and
              ecoregions.  A complete characterization of Arctic biodiversity is equivalent
              to a full unerstanding of the specis present, their cyclical and directional
              changes in distribution and abundance, their interactions, and the structure of
              the arctic environment.  The workshop is intended to outline the scientific
              requirments for evaluating the status and trends of biodiversity throughout the
              Arctic, emphasizing the extend and limitations of current knowledge.  Based on
              these requirements, the participants will bring together all of the relevant
              literature and knowledge--scientific and traditionally based--and focused on
              selected key species and regions.  These will be used subsequently to describe
              and characterize aspects of the Arctic environment and its systems, while
              identifying gaps in current knowledge and it application.  The workshop will
              outline how an understanding of the Arctic environment in terms of its
              biodiversity can contribute to sound, long-term conservation actions.  Expected
              outcomes of the workshop include target summaries on the current understanding
              of Arctic biodivers, case studies of selected species or ecoregions, a summary
              of current conservation concerns in the Arctic with regard to their
              implications for biodiversity and how biodiversity illuminate key conservation
              needs.
