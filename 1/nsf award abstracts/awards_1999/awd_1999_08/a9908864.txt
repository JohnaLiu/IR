The investigation aims to
              uncover basic mechanisms by which biological flows interact with nanostructures
              on cell surfaces. Atomic force microscope (AFM) scanning and subnanometer-scale
              imaging of cell surface mechano-receptors will be performed.  Those receptors
              are nanostructures that undergo three-dimensional molecular conformation
              changes under the influence of flow forces and induce cascades of biological
              responses that affect cell and tissue behavior.  This project is focused on
              direct molecular visualization of nanostructures on cell surfaces by using a
              specially modified AFM immersed in an aqueous medium.  Optical fluorescence
              will be used to image the same area measured with AFM.   The AFM measurements
              will be combined with electrophisiological, immunological and biochemical
              techniques for structure-function correlation studies.  The necessary AFM
              modifications for soft tissues and its accuracy limits will be investigated. 
              The capability of the modified AFM to identify subsets of macromolecules in a
              complex specimen such as a cell membrane will be explored.  
If successful,
              the proposed imaging system will allow improvements in the accuracy of AFM on
              soft tissues immersed in liquids, with relevance to quantifying and
              understanding cell-flow interaction and related electrophysiological and
              biochemical responses.
