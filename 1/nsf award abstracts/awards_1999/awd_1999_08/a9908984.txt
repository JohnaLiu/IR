The
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Silicon Wafer
              Engineering Defect Science (SiWEDS), based at North Carolina State University,
              involves researchers from the University of Arizona, Arizona State University,
              the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and the
              University of California Berkeley.  The Center's mission is to create a unique
              multi-university, multi-company culture in which to address the science and
              technology issues that are important to the international silicon materials
              industry in meeting the future requirements of advanced integrated circuit
              manufacturing.

Using the research expertise and equipment available at
              Berkeley, this partner site will enhance the Center's research in the area of
              electrical and recombination properties of impurities in silicon and the
              gettering of these impurities.
