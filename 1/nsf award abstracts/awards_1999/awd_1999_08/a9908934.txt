Description:  This award is for joint research in civil
              engineering entitled US-India Cooperative Research: Use of Fiber Reinforced
              Polymer (FRP) Materials for Repair of Deteriorated Concrete and Masonry
              Structures.  The co-investigators are Thomas Boothby of Pennsylvania State
              University (PSU) and Abhijit Mukherjee of the Indian Institute of Technology,
              Bombay (IITB).  The investigators will apply FRP materials to the repair of
              deteriorated concrete and masonry buildings, particularly historic buildings
              and structures. The materials include column wrapping,  externally bonded
              sheets and externally bonded plates.  The researchers will perform analytical
              and laboratory studies, and full-scale field trials.    Scope:  This project is
              a new initiative that combines the research efforts currently underway at both
              institutions.  The PSU team has significant laboratory and manufacturing
              resources and the IITB team will give access to trial repair sites that are
              already programmed.  Analytical studies will be done which emphasize analytical
              modeling at IITB and the development of design methods at PSU.  INT provided
              support for the planning visit needed to develop this research collaboration.
