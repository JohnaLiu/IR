Abstract    :
              The process by which new particles nucleate in the atmosphere are poorly
              understood.  This project involves the study of new particle production in the
              remote Arctic atmosphere during spring, when the pollutants accumulated over
              the wintertime are rapidly processed by the onset of photochemical activity. 
              The study will involve airborne measurements of ultrafine particle size spectra
              and condensation nuclei aboard the NCAR C-130 as part of the Tropospheric Ozone
              Production about the Spring Equinox (TOPSE) program.  The ultrafine particle
              measurements will be made in conjunction with simultaneous measurements of gas
              phase sulfuric acid, which will provide insight into the physical/chemical
              mechanisms of new particle formation and particle growth.
