Abstract    :
              9908025
The objective to develop a unified picture of stress production and
              relaxation in polymeric systems which will scale-link the atomic and molecular
              levels and will provide a framework in which the constitutive laws defined at
              larger scales will be based on atomic-scale processes. This effort is motivated
              by the challenges that the polymer industry faces when attempting to predict
              the processing behavior of a polymer melt from its molecular structure. The new
              physical picture to be developed will unify the description of the fast
              relaxation mode, which is related to local atomic rearrangements, and that of
              the slower short-time modes, which are related to bond and chain segment
              reorientation, will explicitly incorporate both intra-and inter-chain
              interactions accounting for excluded volume effects, and will lead to
              appropriate scaling laws. This formalism will be equally valid for short and
              long chain systems. Further, this description has to be in a format suitable
              for incorporation in continuum-like models in order to efficiently account for
              atomic-scale details within such macroscopic descriptions.
