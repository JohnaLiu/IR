Abstract    :
              Meera Chandrasekhar
University of Missouri-Columbia

Exploring Physics, an
              after school program to introduce physics to 5th-7th grade female students was
              the first program developed by Dr. Chandrasekhar.  Since its inception in 1992,
              it has grown to be part of elementary school's curriculum impacting about 300
              students annually.  While maintaining an active research laboratory where she
              studies the optical characteristics of semiconductors, Dr. Chandrasekhar also
              developed three additional programs: (i) Families Exploring Science and
              Technology, where 6th and 7th grade students and their parents build a
              drawbridge; (ii) Saturday Science, where 8th and 9th grade students visit local
              industrial sites and participate in hands-on activities; and, (iii) Newton
              Academy, a ten-day residential science and technology program for female
              students in grades 9 through 11.
