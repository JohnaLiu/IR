The Chicxulub impact structure in the Yucatan Peninsula
              is the site of an extraterrestrial impact 65 million years ago at the end of
              the Cretaceous period. The structure was initially discovered using gravity and
              magnetic data, and has subsequently been investigated through geologic studies,
              drilling and geophysical exploration. It is proposed to explore the Chicxulub
              structure by using magnetotellurics (MT), a geophysical technique that can
              image subsurface electrical conductivity. This is a useful quantity to measure
              at Chicxulub since fractured rock has a low resistivity and re-crystallized
              melt has a very high resistivity. In collaboration with the Universidad
              Autonama de Mexico (UNAM) it is proposed to collect MT data that will (1)
              Locate and map the impact sheet in higher detail than has been previously
              possible, and (2) define the distribution of fractured basement rock to see if
              a correlation exists with deep whole crustal penetrating faults imaged on
              seismic reflection profiles. This study will increase understanding of the
              formation of multi-ring basins and refine estimates of how large impacts can
              change the global environment.
