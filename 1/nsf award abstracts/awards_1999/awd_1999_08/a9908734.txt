Abstract    :
              Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) will conduct a four-week summer
              residential program in chemistry, physics, mathematics and engineering for 30
              girls entering grade eleven. Students will work on individual or team research
              problems during the summer and continue these during the academic year and will
              be encouraged to enter their projects at the Regional Science Fair Competition
              at SIUE in spring, 2001. They will participate in Saturday programs during the
              academic year and continue to receive help from SIUE faculty with their
              projects.
	
The theme for the summer program will be water quality,
              investigating both the quality of surface water and water treatment facilities.
              Instruction in mathematics and the use of computer technology will be
              integrated into the science and engineering program. Topics in mathematics will
              include mathematical functional forms, progressing from linear relationships to
              polynomials to logarithmic and exponential functions to periodic functions, and
              interpretation of data and error analysis.  Instruction on computers will
              include computer-aided design (CAD), spreadsheets and graphs, and research
              using the Internet.
