Abstract    :
              The CASES-99 field program of October 1999 has the goal of providing the most
              comprehensive characterization to date of the evolution and dynamics of
              turbulent mixing processes in the stable nocturnal boundary layer.  In support
              of the observational program there will be numerical modeling studies on scales
              ranging from mesoscale models, through large eddy simulations (LES), to direct
              numerical simulations (DNS).  The motivations for the field program and the
              associated modeling include (1) the lack of understanding of boundary layer
              dynamics, turbulence intermittency, and mixing in stable and very stable
              conditions; (2) the inadequacy of existing parameterizations of mixing and
              transport processes in these conditions; (3) the crucial importance of improved
              parameterizations for large-scale atmospheric models.  This grant supports
              modeling by DNS of the smallest scales of motions.  Observational data and the
              outputs of larger-scale models (mesoscale or LES) are used to define the
              initial conditions.  DNS is then performed for a small domain of interest (for
              example, the region of strong shear at the top of the boundary layer) to define
              the dynamics, mixing, and transport processes in that region.  Phenomena
              important for mixing processes, such as intermittent turbulence, shear
              instabilities, and vortex production by surface irregularities can thereby be
              studied in great detail.  Results will assist in physical interpretation of the
              observations and are essential to improving the parameterization of processes
              that cannot be resolved in larger-scale models.
