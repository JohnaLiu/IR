Abstract    :
              Fayetteville State University, on behalf of a consortium of pre-college and
              higher education administrators and practitioners, has submitted this proposal
              to implement systemic reform strategies to improve science and mathematics
              instruction in forty-seven impoverished, rural school districts in the coastal
              counties of Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.  The project, called
              the Coastal Rural Systemic Initiative, will accomplish its goals by workshops
              and on-site technical assistance to teachers and administrators that will
              increase the understanding of instructional reform and the capacity of the
              districts to accomplish the reform. The initiative will operate through
              regional facilitators who will develop and administrator activities such as:
              curriculum institutes and on-site support; program improvement reviews; school
              renewal conferences; leadrship institutes and on-site facilitation; community
              education foundations; collaborators conferences; and formal partnerships with
              other education reform sponsors.
