Electric power reliability is a very serious
              issue to the U.S. public and industry as the electric power industry is
              restructuring under new regulations.  The Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center (I/UCRC) for Power Systems Engineering will undertake a
              five-year study, "R&D for Electric Power System Reliability Under Emerging
              Market Structures", funded by the Department of Energy doing research with
              Edison Technology Solutions, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Oak Ridge
              National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory.

The research will
              address 1.) Ongoing assessment of reliability issues to form a conceptional
              basis and conduct the market assessments necessary for specific new
              initiatives, 2.) Develop a generation of real-time control methods for
              optimizing a secure and reliable power grid, 3.) Develop strategies to
              facilitate large-scale integration of distributed electric system technologies
              and 4.) Determine the appropriate balance between ideal economic market
              mechanisms and traditional utility operating practices that will result in
              reliable low cost energy.
