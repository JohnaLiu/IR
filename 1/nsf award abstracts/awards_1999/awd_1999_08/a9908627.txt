Abstract    :
              This is a proposal from Educause for a workshop on several critical,
              
network-based, applications-enabling technologies. Many of the most
              
challenging problems related to future uses of networking have to do with
              
matters of security, public key infrastructure, and electronic commerce.
              
This workshop will explore these issues and utilize a series of follow-on
              
meetings to identify technical strategies and possible approaches for
              
multi-university experiments in implementation and use of the technical
              
strategies. A key part of the proposed work is an extensive information
              
dissemination plan, including establishment of a repository of
              
state-by-state PKI and E-Commerce approaches.
