The dynamics of excitons in organic macromolecular systems
              is of central concern toward the rational creation of organic light emitting
              devices.  Improvement in the present understanding of exciton decay and
              intermolecular effects in polymers and other organic macromolecular
              architectures is needed.  In this work detailed photo-physical investigations
              will be carried out to probe the dynamics of organic conjugated rotaxane
              macromolecules in the condensed and liquid phases.  This work will give much
              needed insight into the macromolecular structure-property relationships and
              could lead to the creation of superior organic emitting device materials.  The
              methodology that will be invoked was chosen in order to gain a deeper insight
              into the material's structure-property relationships.  It first concerns
              probing different intermolecular organic materials.  Measurements of the
              singlet exciton decay by emission in a novel organic conjugated rotaxane
              polymer will be investigated by femto-second time resolved luminescence
              experiments.  In various solutions (good and bad solvents) the degree of
              aggregation (and excimer formation) can be measured by the ultra-fast
              upconversion technique. The ability of the rotaxane molecules to inhibit the
              interchain quenching mechanisms will be investigated with a set of molecules
              with varying numbers of rotaxane groups attached.

This research could lead
              to a qualitative understanding of the role of rotaxanes in inhibiting
              intermolecular quenching of luminescence.  It will provide a base for a program
              focused on understanding the dynamics of excitons in these electroluminescent
              polymers, which could find application toward light-emitting diodes.
