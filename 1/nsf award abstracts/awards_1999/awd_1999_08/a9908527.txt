Abstract    :
              This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science
              Foundation, provides support for a special conference, sponsored jointly with
              NASA, on building and deploying autonomous systems in extreme environments.
              Autonomous Systems are defined as permanent geophysical or astrophysical
              installations that are self-sustaining over periods of months and years. They
              acquire data on a regular time interval or upon a triggering event and either
              store that data or transmit it to a data center. Many investigators conduct
              research in polar, sea floor, or other extreme environments that require
              autonomous systems. Because of the burgeoning scientific potential for such
              systems, the present is a good time to bring the community together during a
              workshop in order to discuss the special challenges associated with developing
              these systems for extreme environments so that past mistakes can be minimized
              and past successes can be built upon toward better scientific output. The
              conference venue will be the Von Karman Auditorium at the Jet Propulsion
              Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and the tentative conference dates are
              August 31- September 2, 1999. The goals of the workshop are to promote dialogue
              on autonomous system design, make recommendations on power, thermal, data,
              communications, and packaging systems, and to decide on standardization for
              future systems. The workshop will also include discussion of, and possible
              recommendation of, testing criteria that should be met before systems could
              deployed in extreme environments.
