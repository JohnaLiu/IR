This U.S.-Czech research project between Robert A. Weiss
              of the University of Connecticut and J. Jancar of the Technical University of
              Brno features efforts to improve low-temperature fracture toughness of the
              material isotactic polypropylene (PP).  The researchers will use a dispersed
              thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer (TLCP) phase to delocalize plastic
              deformation at the crack tip.  They expect that TLCP may enhance fracture
              resistance of PP by inducing cold-drawing near crack planes.  If successful,
              their research should reveal a new approach for obtaining a better interaction
              between the PP matrix and the TLCP inclusion.  Results would be useful in the
              self-reinforced composites in various industries.

The materials research
              project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
              enabling experts in the Unites States and Central Europe to combine
              complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.
