R. Radeztsky, Arizona State University


Boundary
              layer receptivity, and its contribution to determining the laminar-to-turbulent
              transition process, is one of the most important basic fluid mechanics issues
              within aerodynamics.  The Radeztsky/Saric investigation will utilize the
              premier experimental facility that has been established at the Arizona State
              University for their investigation of the instabilities that are produced by
              the interaction of acoustic wave packets with a laminar boundary layer.  The
              wave packets permit the ASU - developed "phase separation technique" to
              distinguish between the acoustic and the hydrodynamic fluctuations.  

It is
              expected that significant guidance for analytical/theoretical work will derive
              from these experiments.
