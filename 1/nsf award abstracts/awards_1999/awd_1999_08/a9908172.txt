Proposal Title:  IFAC Workshop on
              Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
Methods for Nonlinear Control Project
              Abstract:
The main objective of the workshop is to foster in-depth discussion
              of recent theoretical and practical developments in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
              approaches to nonlinear control by experts in the field (including 18 invited
              speakers) as well as interested researchers and practitioners.  New
              technologies have created engineering problems where successful controller
              designs must account for nonlinear effects, yet existing theory for general
              nonlinear systems often proves insufficient.  Examples include autonomous
              vehicles in air, land, space and underwater, smart materials for actuators,
              sensors and control devices, robotics for manufacturing and medicine,
              micromachines, electrical networks, power electronic devices, control of fluids
              and fluid-structure interactions, molecular control and vibration suppression
              in engineering structures.  It is expected that the workshop will have a
              significant impact in both theory and application as the discussions and
              interactions among the researchers will lead to new developments,
              collaborations and merging of ideas that further the field.
