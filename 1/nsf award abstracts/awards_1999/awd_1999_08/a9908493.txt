Abstract    :
              Douglass Project for Women in Mathematics, Science and Engineering

Established in 1986, the
              Douglass Project encourages women to study, explore, and pursue careers in
              mathematics, science and engineering.  The project is housed at Douglass
              College which is among the largest undergraduate women's colleges in the United
              States, enrolling more that 3,000 students of whom 33% are women of color, 40%
              are first generation college students, and 30% come from homes where a language
              other that English is spoken. The project provides a three-year hands-on
              science program for 9th-11th graders; peer, faculty and graduate student
              mentoring; internships; and, opportunities for students to interact with role
              models.  An outreach component to a grammar school and to Girl Scouts of the
              U.S.A. is also part of the program.  Over 900 female high school students have
              participated in the hands-on science program.
