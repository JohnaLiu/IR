Abstract    :
                  This project involves the construction and testing of a buoy-mounted
              instrument to measure ozone over the ocean surface.  This instrument will be
              used in future projects to study ozone climatology, trends, and transport over
              the ocean, and the oxidation capacity of the marine boundary layer. It will
              also be an initial step in the development of atmospheric chemical sensors for
              buoys.  Buoy-based measurements over the ocean are ideal for studying long-term
              trends, since stations can be set up far from most point sources of ozone
              precursors.  The development of the buoy-mounted ozone sensor will involve a
              collaboration between Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and Physical
              Sciences Inc. (PSI), of Andover, MA.
