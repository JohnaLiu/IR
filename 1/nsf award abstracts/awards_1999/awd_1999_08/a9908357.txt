MELIOPOULOS

This is a planning grant to hold a
              planning meeting at Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT) to become a research
              site of the multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              for Power Systems Engineering.  The GIT research center would be added to those
              of Cornell University, The University of California, Berkeley, Washington State
              University and Howard University.

The research projects proposed for
              addition to the Center's established research agenda are:

1. 
              University/Industry/Government Workshop on Power System Electromagnetic
              Influence, Power Quality and Saftey

2.  Power System Electromagetic Modeling
              and Design

3.  Comprehensive Power System Reliability Assessment

4. 
              Optical-Based Sensors for Power Systems Applications

5.  Comprehensive
              Electromagnetic Modeling of Power System Components for Lighting and Shielding
              Studies

6.  Multiresolution Time-Domain Techniques (MRTD.
