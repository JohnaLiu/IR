Abstract    :
              Rizzoli/Ducklow
Funding is provided to continue and expand an interdisciplinary
              study of the
Black Sea pelagic ecosystem. The overall goal is to investigate
              the transports
and biogeochemical processes that control the biogeochemical
              cycle of the Black
Sea using coupled models with data assimilation capacities.
              Three research
topics will be tackled: (1) Model the distinct vertical
              biogeochemical structure of
the Black Sea and dynamical coupling of the Oxic,
              Suboxic and Anoxic layers;
(2) Investigate the effects of circulation dynamics
              on biogeochemical transports;
and (3) conduct adjoint data assimilation
              studies using SeaWiFS data for the period 1997-99.
