Abstract    :
              This research will attempt to identify the most prevalent factors in
              decisions
of highly capable students from underrepresented groups to forego
              study for
science or engineering doctorates. These groups (blacks, Hispanics
              and Indians)
will soon comprise 30 percent of the population but they receive
              only five
percent of the S&E doctorates.

The study will obtain information
              by interviewing 12 randomly selected
subjects. The interview data will be
              analyzed to identify threads and patterns
regarding the reluctance of the
              subjects to pursue doctoral study. In addition,
the subjects will be asked to
              suggest initiatives which would be helpful in
attracting more people like
              themselves to doctoral study.
