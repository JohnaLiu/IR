Abstract    :
              This project will adapt a sonar system for acoustic imaging of hydrothermal flow
              regimes for use on the ROV Jason.  The sonar system will be used to image, map
              and quantitatively measure hydrothermal plumes and diffuse flow over a range of
              spatial and temporal scales on the main Endeavour vent field on the Juan de
              Fuca Ridge.  Advanced computer visualization and analytical methods will be
              used to identify, extract and measure parameters of plumes and diffuse flow to
              determine mising and dispersl behavior of these flow regimes.
