In the fall of 1998 Hurricane Georges rocked the Caribbean. 
              For the Caribbean National Rainforest in Puerto Rico, known as El Yunque,
              hurricanes are a natural part of life and Hurricane George destroyed all but
              the most hurricane-sturdy plants.  A natural disaster provides opportunities
              for students to learn science as well as to understand the impact of nature on
              human lives.

This exploratory grant will provide the means to gather the
              necessary resources while regeneration is taking place (within a year of the
              hurricane) and to develop pilot modules so that students may learn about
              erosion, nutrient cycling, plant growth and biodiversity.  A set of materials
              based on this pilot would expose students to cutting edge techniques used in
              eco-system science so that the school science they are doing would mirror the
              activities of a professional scientist.  Based on the success of this pilot
              project, a complete set of ten modules could be produced.
