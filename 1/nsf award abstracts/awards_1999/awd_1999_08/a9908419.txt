Abstract    :
              The Maricopa Advanced Technological Education Center (MATEC) has fostered the
              development of work-relevant, industry-endorsed, curricula and instructional
              modules for use in community college programs primarily in semiconductor
              manufacturing.  The modules include the background science and mathematics
              needed.  Over 100 modules in 19 clusters permit faculty to use the modules to
              customize their courses. The courses provide an integrated, accessible
              professional growth system that ensures currency and relevancy to local
              industry.  The instructional delivery system uses virtual reality both in an
              observing mode and in an interactive mode to educate technicians in clean room
              practices and instruments.  The Center has programs for high schools to
              encourage a more diverse population to seek employment in the semiconductor and
              supporting industries.  The Center seeks to become a self-sustaining entity
              working with SEMATECH and the Semiconductor Industry Association for education
              and workforce development of the industry.  Activities include memberships,
              development and distribution of curricula and instructional materials,
              promotion of faculty development opportunities, and participation in
              Internet-delivered web commerce.  Certification of semiconductor manufacturing
              technicians is being investigated.
