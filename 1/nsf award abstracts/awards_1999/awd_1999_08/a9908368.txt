In the work, shape memory alloy (SMA) response to uniaxial and
              multiaxial loading will be studied with Scanning Electron Microscopy and
              Electron BackScattered Diffraction. The experiments will provide detailed
              information on the evolution of variants under different loading conditions and
              will be compared to the PIs "multivariant" micromechanics model. In addition,
              results will give insight into the assumptions for transformation strains used
              in plasticity-based SMA constitutive models. The work represents investigation
              of aspects of SMA behavior that have not yet been examined: while the materials
              science community has dealt with identification of martensitic variant
              structure, and the mechanics community has dealt with macroscale modeling, a
              direct understanding of exactly which variants form under applied load and
              precisely how that translates into macroscopic strain for different loading
              conditions has not been studied. Yet these issues must be understood to make
              significant progress in SMA research and applications.
