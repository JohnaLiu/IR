Abstract    :
              	The long term goal of this SGER Proposal is to investigate restrictions to
              protein synthesis in cells and to develop enhanced heterologous protein
              production systems. This will be accomplished by studying the protein output of
              different transfected cell types in living fruit flies. Green fluorescent
              protein (GFP) will be the construct marker and the production will be directly
              observed by insect organ fluorescence. IL-2, the product protein, will be fused
              to the GFP using a histidine tag to facilitate protein isolation, and an
              enzymatic cleavage site incorporated in the system along with an appropriate
              promoter. Various promoters will be used to drive expression in different
              tissues. The work should lead to high protein-producing cell lines and/or
              select producing strains of Drosophila and information on the factors
              controlling protein production, e.g., promoters, chaperones and foldases,
              etc.
