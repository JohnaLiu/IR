Abstract    :
              This award in the Arctic Contaminants program is supported by the Office
              of
Polar Programs, the Division of Chemistry, and the MPS Office
              of
Multidisciplinary Activities.  Dr. Xianliang Zhou of the State
              University
of New York at Albany will investigate the effect of photolysis of
              nitrogen
oxides in the snowpack on ozone depletion in the Arctic marine
              boundary
layer after polar sunrise.  Heterogeneous processes in the snowpack
              and in
snow interstitial air will be investigated in detail.  A
              sensitive
measurement technique for HONO and HO2NO2 in cold environments will
              be
developed and used for measurements at Alert, NWT, Canada,
              in
February-April 2000. The 2-channel measurement device utilizes
              HPLC
instrumentation and so must be adapted for cold temperatures that
              affect
flow characteristics.  Vertical profiles of the two nitrogen oxides,
              from
100 cm below the snow surface to a few meters above ground, will
              be
established before and after polar sunrise.  This project will
              contribute
to PSE2000, the Polar Sunrise Experiment, aimed at investigating
              the role
of the frozen ocean surface and snowpack on processing atmospheric
              gases
and the chemistry of the Arctic marine boundary layer.
