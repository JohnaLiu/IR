This award supports a National Science Foundation
              Dissertation Enhancement award to Dr. John Eaton of Stanford University.  Dr.
              Eaton's Ph.D. student, Mr. Anthony Paris, will work for six months in the
              laboratory of Professor Koichi Hishida of Keio University in Yokohama, Japan. 
              The research project will investigate the mechanisms by which turbulence in air
              and water channel flows may be modified by the presence of small disperse
              particles.

While past studies have found that turbulence levels may be
              augmented or attenuated in flows laden with particles, the physics associated
              with such turbulence modification remain poorly understood.  This research
              collaboration will bring together the unique facilities for the investigation
              of turbulence attenuation and augmentation in channel flows available at
              Stanford University and Keio University, respectively.  The research will
              provide information to turbulence modelers that should facilitate use of
              particle-laden flows in industrial applications such as particulate transport,
              pollution control, and pulverized coal combustion.
