Abstract    :
              George Castro
San Jose State University

During his professional employment,
              beginning in 1968 at IBM Research, Dr. Castro made it his avocation to mentor
              youth from underrepresented groups to advance their education in science and
              engineering.  In 1971, he began an on-the-job training program to assist
              minority students in becoming technicians at IBM Research.  Dr. Castro also
              created research positions for undergraduate students and over the next two
              decades hired and mentored over twenty minority and female science and
              engineering students.  During this time, Dr. Castro frequently volunteered his
              time to visit elementary schools, high schools and universities to speak to
              students about careers in science and engineering. As President of the Society
              for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), Dr.
              Castro helped build this organization into one of national prominence that
              serves over a thousand students a year.
