Abstract    :
              This project is a study of the formation of an antarctic sea ice cover through
              the agglutination of ice crystals into small floes ("pancakes") which grow and
              aggregate into larger floes, ultimately forming a continuous ice cover.  The
              objective of the project is to determine how this evolution of pancake ice is
              determined by different environmental conditions.  The annual areal coverage of
              antarctic pancake ice is estimated at approximately six million square
              kilometers, more than a third of the wintertime sea ice area.  The project will
              begin with a field experiment to collect a comprehensive data set of the in
              situ environmental formation conditions.  Laboratory work will be carried out
              subsequently, both with plastic simulated ice and with naturally grown ice in
              an outdoor wave tank.  Theoretical and numerical studies will be carried out in
              parallel.  Results from this study will provide quantitative information about
              the physical structure of a pancake ice cover, and its mechanical action under
              a range of environmental conditions.  These results will bear significantly on
              the signature of pancake ice in satellite imagery, its utilization as a habitat
              by sea ice and cold water biota, and its proper effect on integrated global
              climate models.
