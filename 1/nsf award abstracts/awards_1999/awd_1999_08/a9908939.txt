Abstract    :
              This research will assess the individual and combined effects of the use of
              radar, satellite and targeted in situ data on forecasts of hurricanes near
              landfall.  Specifically, the research will involve: 1) development of
              methodology to assimilate airborne Doppler radar observations collected during
              field experiments and to assess the effect on the prediction of hurricane
              intensity, inner core structure, wind, and precipitation, 2) assessment of the
              effect of  satellite data on the prediction of track and intensity changes, 3)
              study of the possible targeting strategy for the initialization of hurricane
              prediction which combines "targeted" in situ observations (aircraft dropsondes
              and ship measurements, and 4) model study of the dynamics of the eye region and
              the processes contributing to hurricane motion and its intensification and
              weakening.
