Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah will
              purchase parallel and desk top computers for computational chemistry research
              and education. This equipment will enhance research in  a variety of areas
              including studies of small doubly charged anions; Rydberg-bound molecules;
              autodetachment dynamics in quasi dipole-bound anions; microsolvation:
              structure, thermochem & reactivity of hydrated clusters; interfacial chemistry;
              and zeolite catalysis.  

This research program will have a substantial
              impact on the computational methods used today in chemical research.  In
              addition, there will be significant contributions to education via web-based
              instruction.
