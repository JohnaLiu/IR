Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri in Saint
              Louis will acquire an upgrade of an existing 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas, including a) the study of
              reactions of bimetallic complexes; b) the chemistry of linked metalloborane
              clusters; c) reactions of small molecules with larger metalloborane clusters;
              d) dehydrocoupling of hydrosilanes promoted by transition metals; e) synthesis
              and structural studies of arene oxides & dioxides; f) synthetic applications of
              (arene)-ruthenium (II) complexes; and g) synthesis and reactions of chiral,
              non-racemic allylic hydroxy phosphonates.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research.  Results from these NMR studies are useful in
              furthering our understanding of catalysis.
