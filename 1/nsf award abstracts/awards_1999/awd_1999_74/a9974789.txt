Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Duquesne University will
              purchase hardware and software to implement a Beowulf computer cluster. This
              equipment will enhance research in  a variety of areas including a) development
              of simulation code; studies of b) substrates at solid/liquid interfaces; c)
              interactions between substrates & receptors; and d) metal-dielectric
              interfaces. The investigators will also investigate instantaneous normal mode
              theory of vibrational spectroscopy; Brownian dynamics simulations of proteins
              at interfaces; and carry out simulations of densification processes.

A
              workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to
              satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network"
              also serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and
              algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities,
              and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel
              processing.
