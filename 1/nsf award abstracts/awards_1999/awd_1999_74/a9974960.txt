              Software:  A Performance Modeling Framework for the Analysis of Complex
              Applications and Systems

This proposal aims to develop a performance
              framework (Prophesy) that facilitates the development of very-fine as well as
              coarse-grain analytical performance models of applications, to allow
              understanding of how realist, large applications and computer system features
              interact and affect performance.   Furthermore the project will develop an
              algebra which will identify how elementary performance models of system
              components and application algorithms should be composed to reflect the
              performance of the application executing on parallel machines, Grids or  GiBs
              platforms.

The project will test the developed methods in three production
              class applications, a scientific application including a visualization
              component, an application using AMR algorithms, and an ASCI class application. 
              Among the hardware architectures  to be modeled, the complex HTMT architecture
              is included in this study.  

The resulting will make some important advances
              in the  system level hardware-software codesign.  Specifically the proposed
              work will benefit computing system designers, application designers, and 
              compiler developers in building their respective class of systems.
