Virtually all plants experience inbreeding depression, with
              offspring of related individuals having lower fitness than offspring of
              unrelated individuals. This research investigates inbreeding depression in
              species, such as trees or grasses, that live for many years. Goals are to: 1)
              develop genetically-based models of inbreeding depression in long lived
              perennials; and 2) develop methods for measuring inbreeding depression over
              short time spans, rather than over the entire perennial life history. Methods
              include computer and analytic modeling of specific, well documented,
              genetically-based inbreeding depression in perennials. Statistical methods will
              use patterns of genetic variation and information about individual age to infer
              the amount of inbreeding depression.

The research offers genetically
              explicit insight into inbreeding depression in perennials. It is anticipated
              that the research will provide guidance for breeding of long-lived plants
              important in, for instance, reforestry and fruit tree breeding. Greater
              understanding of inbreeding depression in perennials is an important
              consideration in developing conservation and natural resource management plans
              for the many ecosystems in which perennials predominate. Finally, the research
              provides basic insight into the interaction between life history and inbreeding
              depression. Such interactions are of particular importance in understanding the
              evolution and diversity of plant breeding systems.
