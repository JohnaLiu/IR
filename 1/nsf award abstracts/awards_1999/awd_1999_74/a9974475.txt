Abstract    :
              Instances of early learning (e.g. language acquisition, imprinting, birdsong
              learning) illustrate that the nervous system's ability to change in response to
              experience is exaggerated during distinct sensitive periods in development. 
              This proposal is aimed at identifying biological conditions that foster this
              developmental plasticity by investigating the molecular mechanisms by which
              gonadal androgens influence the timing of vocal learning in birds.  Drawing on
              earlier work demonstrating that activation of forebrain N-Methyl-D aspartate
              receptors is critical for vocal learning, and the closure of the sensitive
              learning period is associated with a decrease in this receptor subtype, the
              proposed studies will employ quantitative measures of gene expression to
              determine if androgens regulate developmental changes in NMD receptor
              expression and composition to control when learning occurs.  The work will
              broaden our understanding of how hormones affect neural and behavioral
              plasticity, and also may reveal strategies for augmenting learning and memory
              in later life.
