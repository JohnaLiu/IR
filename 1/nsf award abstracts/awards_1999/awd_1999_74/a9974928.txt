Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at The University of California in
              Los Angeles will acquire a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will
              enhance research in the following areas:  a) synthesis, reactivity and
              characterization of novel carborane- and polyhedral borane-containing
              compounds; b) synthetic organic chemistry; c) synthesis via organometallic
              chemistry; d) endohedral metal complexes of fullerenes; e) supramolecular and
              macromolecular chemistry; and f) polyazacarbons and polyazaheterocarbons for
              materials research.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the
              most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure
              of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. 
              Results from these NMR studies will be especially useful in  polymer and
              materials chemistry.
