Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University will acquire a
              Single Photon Counting Fluorimeter with Lifetime Capability. This equipment
              will enhance research which explores the excited state reactivity of Cu(I)
              complexes in solution; photo-induced intramolecular electron transfer in Cu(I)-
              & Ru(II)-based donor-acceptor complexes; and the effect of small gas molecules
              on the absorption and emission of solvatochromic organic cations and their
              charge-transfer complexes within acidic zeolites.

The fluorescence
              spectrometer counts photons of light in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible
              regions.  When a sample of material is illuminated by UV light at a given
              frequency or energy, the reflected light consists of the original UV light, but
              also may contain light in the visible region of the spectrum, at a lower
              frequency or energy.  The fluorimeter is a very sensitive instrument used to
              detect the fluorescence signal.
