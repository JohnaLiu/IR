Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Research Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              biophysics and is entitled "Automatic analysis of protein NMR spectra for
              high-throughput NMR structure determination: a new technique for the Human
              Proteome Project."  High-throughput protein structure determination (HTPSD)
              will be a key technique in the 
Human Proteome Project.  For NMR HTPSD,
              automation of spectral resonance assignment is essential. 
AutoAssign is a
              constraint-based expert system that automatically determines backbone resonance
              
assignments using nine specific NMR experiments.  This project supports
              further development of AutoAssign to robustly determine "complete" resonance
              assignments using many kinds of NMR data.
