Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              Program (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at The University of Hawaii
              in Manoa will acquire an upgrade of an existing 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas, including studies of
              natural products from blue-green algae; chemical marine ecology; biologically
              active natural products; biosynthesis of alkaloids; biosynthesis of anatoxins,
              retinoids, carotenoids & polarized polyenes; novel dehydrogenation catalysts;
              hydrogen storage materials; the design, synthesis & structure/reactivity
              characterization of structural motifs that employ rigid tetradentate Lewis
              bases & bidentate Lewis acids; molecular wires based on structure of DNA;
              silicon nanoclusters for use in optoelectronic & photovoltaic cells;
              halogenated marine prostanoids & their analogs; synthesis of roseophilin;
              enantioselective synthesis of allenyl ethers; acyl silane synthesis; and solid
              state NMR studies of elastin

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
              is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
              structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize
              specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
              The results from these NMR studies are useful in a number of areas including
              materials chemistry and biology.
