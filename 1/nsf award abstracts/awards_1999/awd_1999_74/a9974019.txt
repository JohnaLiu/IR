This research project investigates the use of multiphoton
              excitation of molecular states to control the dynamics of molecular motion. 
              Analysis of the motion will be carried out through the study of the
              fragmentation behavior of the excited system.  Four sets of experiments are
              envisioned:  1) a search for the physical origin of the phase lag between the
              modulated signals for various product channels; 2) the breaking of selected
              bonds in halogenated methane and ethylene molecules; 3) control of the angular
              distribution of photodissociation reactions; and 4) the creation and alignment
              of pendular states of molecules.  The project is jointly supported by the
              Division of Physics and the Division of Chemistry.
