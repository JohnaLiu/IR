Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              biophysics and is entitled "Comparison of three-dimensional protein structures
              using geometric morphometric methods: an assessment of structural similarity." 
                
Geometric morphometric algorithms are being used to identify proteins with
              similar three-dimensional structures.  These methods compare proteins using the
              x,y,z coordinates of homologous points and are robust to heterogeneous
              variation among landmarks.  They compare multiple protein structures
              simultaneously and can thus be used to construct a protein structure space for
              identifying functionally similar proteins.
