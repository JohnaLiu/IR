Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Research Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              population biology and is entitled "Integration of genetic and environmental
              data into a comparative database:  elucidating the role of across-Andes
              dispersal in the diversification of lowland organisms."  This research bridges
              genetic and geographic (GIS) technologies to examine the role of the Andes in
              biological diversification.  Relevant environmental parameters are
              characterized across a known across-Andes dispersal corridor.  These data,
              coupled with natural history information of the dispersing organisms, are being
              used to construct models of genetic structure.  The model's predictions are
              then tested using empirical genetic data.
