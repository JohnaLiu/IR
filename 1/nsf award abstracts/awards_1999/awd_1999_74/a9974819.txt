              Abstract

The analysis of structure/function relationships of biological
              macromolecules and macromolecular assemblies in solution increasingly is
              becoming a center point of contemporary research in the biological sciences.
              Analytical ultracentrifugation and light scattering techniques have contributed
              significantly to research progress in this area. The proposed research focuses
              on the development of a comprehensive data analysis software package for these
              techniques. Data from light scattering, sedimentation velocity and equilibrium
              experiments under a range of operating conditions, e.g., different rotor
              speeds, column lengths and macromolecular concentrations, will be
              simultaneously fitted to global models in order to extract hydrodynamic and
              thermodynamic information from the system under investigation. By developing a
              means to concurrently analyze data from multiple experiments and run conditions
              generated by multiple techniques in a global fit, it is intended to
              significantly enhance resolution and accuracy by complementing the individual
              strengths of each method and run condition with the information provided by all
              others.  Modern error analysis techniques will be implemented to evaluate the
              statistical significance of the fitted models and their associated parameters.
              The software will be optimized for a scalable parallel distributed Beowulf
              computer and an intuitive graphical user interface and comprehensive
              documentation will be developed, as well as an Internet-based SQL database
              interface to assist the user in the management of the large amounts of data
              involved in such a project and to facilitate the exchange of data between
              collaborators.
