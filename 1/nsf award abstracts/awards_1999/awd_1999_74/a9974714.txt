Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at The University of Oklahoma will
              acquire a Gas Chromatograph/Probe Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will
              enhance research in many areas, including transition metal-mediated organic
              reactions; carbon dioxide conversion; stereoselective pinacol coupling;
              chemistry of C-centered organometallic radicals; dynamic properties of
              misdirected ligand complexes; reactions of highly electron-rich
              organometallics; synthesis, stabilization and applications of reactive organic
              moieties in organic & polymer chemistry; marine natural products for anticancer
              drugs; design of chiral transition metal catalysts; preparation of chiral
              titanocene & zirconocene dichlorides for metallocene-catalyzed C-C and C-H bond
              forming reactions; characterization and environmental chemistry of dissolved
              organic matter; and the characterization of landfill leachates.  

Gas
              Chromatography/Probe Mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is a technique used to probe
              intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
              array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules.  It affords the
              chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of
              compounds, and is essential for carrying out frontier research in many fields
              of chemistry.
