Abstract    :
                 When moving around in the world, we see what is called 'optic flow' of the
              visual world, giving information about our direction and speed of movement. 
              Signals from the neurons (nerve cells) in the retina of the eye are carried by
              the optic nerve to the brain.  One pathway called the accessory optic system
              (AOS) carries information about motion over the whole visual field to nerve
              centers called nuclei in the brainstem.  Within the retina there are many
              neurons that are directionally sensitive, being excited by a visual stimulus
              that moves in one direction, and inhibited by motion in the opposite direction.
               It is not clear how these excitatory and inhibitory inputs are combined by the
              neurons in the central nuclei, except that the interactions are more complex
              than simply linear addition.  This project uses electrophysiological recordings
              from inside single cells in an unusual preparation of an entirely isolated
              turtle brain, to study interactions of directionally selective inputs
              responding to the same part of the visual world.  Pharmacological manipulations
              are used to clarify the separate functions of the excitatory and inhibitory
              inputs, and better understand the membrane properties underlying the sensory
              integration.
   Results will be critical for understanding the fundamental
              importance of visual signals in controlling stable eye position, posture, and
              locomotion in the real world, and the impact will extend beyond visual
              neuroscience to understanding functional integrative mechanisms at the cellular
              level in the brain.  The project provides excellent training for a graduate
              student.
