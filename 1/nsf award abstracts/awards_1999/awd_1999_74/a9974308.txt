              ABSTRACT

This is a study of hydrocarbon
              chemistry related to soot formation.  The approach is centered on single-pulse
              shock-tube studies in a high-pressure shock-tube facility designed to permit
              extraction of quenched reaction intermediates and products as functions of
              well-defined pressures, temperatures, and residence times.  Extracted samples
              are analyzed with gas chromatography/mass specteometry (GC/MS).  Additional
              studies are conducted in a low-pressure shock tube where the principal means of
              reaction diagnosis is the laser schlieren method of rate evaluation.  Three
              systems are studied:  (1) benzyne chemistry including in-situ pyrolysis of
              phthalic anhydride to produce benzyne and its subsequent pyrolysis to examine
              its role both as a decomposition pathway in aromatics chemistry and as a
              possible route to larger molecule formation through biphenylene; (2)
              diacetylene pyrolysis including shock-tube studies of dilute diacetylene/argon
              and dilute diacetylene/acetylene/argon mixtures to examine the mechanism of
              soot formation in the presence of diacetylene; and (3) reactions of
              1,5-hexadiyne including shock-tube studies of 1,5-heaxdiyne to discriminate
              among alternate pathways to benzene.
