	This project supports the dissertation
              research of an anthropology student from the University of Chicago studying the
              role of minority language revival in the development of a European region. 
              Since the 1980s Gaelic has been undergoing a government funded renaissance, let
              by members of a Gaelic speaking urban middle class.  There has been increased
              funding of Gaelic education and communication and a redefinition of Gaelic as a
              form of human capital.  These claims have been accepted by the Scottish
              government, the British state and the European Union.  The student will try to
              understand the role of this minority language in the economic development of
              the region through fieldwork with Gaelic language promoters and their
              constituents, Gaelic speakers in two sites in the Scottish highlands. Gaelic
              development agencies in Inverness will be studied as well as a crofting
              township on the island of Benbecula.  In both sites the student will do
              participant observation and semi-structured interviews of how Gaelic functions
              to encourage, facilitate, and impede the economic development of the region. 
              This research is important because managing the relation of local cultural
              minorities to the national state is one of the most challenging tasks faced by
              contemporary governments, from ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia to Mayan Indians
              in Mexico.  This case of a seemingly successful renaissance and adaptation will
              provide important material to be compared with other cases of development and
              conflict. In addition the project supports the training of a young social
              scientist, and advances our knowledge of this important area of the world.
