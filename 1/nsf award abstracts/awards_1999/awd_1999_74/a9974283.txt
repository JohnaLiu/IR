The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory meeting  "Eukaryotic DNA
              Replication," to be held  September 15 through September 19, 1999, at Cold
              Spring Harbor, New York, will be the seventh biannual conference held on this
              subject.  The meeting will be devoted to fundamental research topics related to
              chromosome duplication, structure, and function.  The need for this meeting is
              evidenced by the rapid advances made in this field over recent years.  The 1999
              meeting will include talks  on  (1) the replication of viral chromosomes,
              including those of SV40, polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus,
              papillomaviruses, and Epstein-Barr virus; (2) chromosomal replication and gene
              amplification in organisms as diverse as yeast, Drosophila,and Xenopus and in 
              mammalian cells; (3) control of DNA replication; (4) structure and function of
              chromosomal elements; and (5) control of cell cycle progression and S phase
              specific gene expression; (6) DNA replication and DNA repair;  and (7)
              telomeres. 

The replication of an organism's genetic material is an
              essential feature of all life.  This meeting will bring together an
              international group of researchers working to deepen our understanding of this
              highly complex process.  It will ensure that recent results will be
              communicated and discussed in an atmosphere of face-to-face contact, an
              atmosphere which fosters the intellectual synergy necessary for rapid progress.
               Participants will include established and emerging leaders in the field along
              with those just entering.  This award will be used to help defray the costs of
              less-established investigators participating in the conference.
