Abstract    :
              The project is designed to address two important problems in reproductive
              biology.  The first deals with the biochemical equivalence of sperm due to
              transcript sharing in developing spermatids.  It is proposed to determine if
              the spermatid-expressed Sperm Adhesion Molecule 1(Spam 1) gene product (a
              membrane protein with bifunctional roles in fertilization) is not shared among
              conjoined spermatids, resulting in biochemically different sperm in
              heterozygotes and hemizygotes.  The latter will have a Spam 1 null mutation or
              a transgene and will be constructed using gene targeting (or "knockout") and
              transgenic technologies.  The heterozygotes will carry a Robertsonian
              translocation [Rb(6.16)] shown to have a Spam 1 mutant allele associated with
              decreased mRNA, protein and fertilizing ability.  Spam 1 mRNA and protein will
              be analyzed using RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization, confocal microscopy
              and fluorescence activated cell sorting.  The second problem focuses on the
              effects of the absence, and overabundance, of Spam 1 on sperm function. 
              Hemizygotes for the Spam 1 transgene and the null will be used to generate
              homozygotes whose sperm will be analyzed for various characteristics and
              fertilizing ability in vitro and in vivo.  The studies could provide a
              mechanism for transmission ratio distortion and increase our understanding of
              the role Spam 1 in mammalian fertilization.
