Abstract    :
              This project, carried out by Professor Jon Amster and his students, and
              supported by Analytical and Surface Chemistry,  involves performance evaluation
              and analytical methods development with a 4.7 Tesla Fourier Transform mass
              spectrometer.  The project develops a complete understanding of the space
              charge phenomenon in the cell of an FT ICR instrument, and documents its effect
              on the mass measurement accuracy.  The space charge phenomenon is modeled by a
              new set of sophisticated computations, and experiments are carried out by
              changes in the physical design of the cell and the potentials applied to it. 
              High mass measurement accuracy for protein-derived ions is used as an exemplary
              application to emphasize improvements in performance.

The analysis cell of a
              Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer can only contain a
              certain number of ions before the ions begin to interact with each other (the
              space charge effect).  The space charge effect limits the mass measurement
              accuracy of the instrument.  This project of Professor Jon Amster of the
              University of Georgia models the space charge effect in calculation and
              experiment, and through enlightened instrument design, minimizes its effect on
              highly charged ions.  The result is much improved mass measurement accuracy
              needed for biomolecular analysis.
