Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Kentucky will acquire
              a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
              areas, including studies on 1) the formation of cationic group 13 compounds; 2)
              formation of uni-ligated group 13 anions; 3) precursor molecules to corrosion
              resistant coatings of alumina; 4) organic conformation & function in water; 5)
              p-stacked foldamers; 6) pseudocyclic peptides; 7) the chemistry of fullerenes;
              8) DNA dynamics; 9) chemical probes of protein prenylation; 10) redox catalysis
              in enzymes; 11) active site of FeSOD; 12) studies on model flavins; and 13)
              hydrogen bonding partners.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
              the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
              structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize
              specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. 
              Results from these NMR studies will be especially useful in areas such as
              polymers, catalysis, and in materials science.
