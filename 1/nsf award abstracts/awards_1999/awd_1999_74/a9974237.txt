Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Research Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              prokaryotic genetics and is entitled "Molecular evolution and population
              genetic variation of neutral and non-neutral loci in the E. coli genome."  The
              amount of genetic variation within the model organism Escherichia coli's genome
              is controlled by the forces of population size,
recombination, mutation,
              selection, recombination and gene duplication or loss.  Many loci are suspected
              to be subject to different combinations of these forces.  The level of
              naturally occurring genetic variation is being surveyed for nucleotide sequence
              level variation at several gene loci of known function.  Genetic estimates and
              statistical tests for the amount, nature, and distribution of genetic variation
              under various models of molecular evolution are being performed.
