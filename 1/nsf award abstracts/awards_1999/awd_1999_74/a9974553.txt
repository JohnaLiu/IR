Title: Applying Compiler Technology to
              Proof-Carrying Code
PI:  Andrew W. Appel

Proof-carrying code (PCC) is an
              exciting new development in mobile-code
security.  An untrusted code provider
              provides a native-code program
along with a proof of safety; the code consumer
              can check the proof before
executing the program.  Since proof-checking is a
              simple and
easily mechanized process, the trusted computing base of this
              system
can be quite small.  However, PCC is an immature technology and
              faces
several challenges: keeping proof size small, proving safety of
              complex
operations such as allocating and initializing data structures,
              and
making the code consumer's safety policy universal and
              language-independent.
This project will address each of these issues, applying
              science and
technology
developed for compilers to the area of program
              verification.
