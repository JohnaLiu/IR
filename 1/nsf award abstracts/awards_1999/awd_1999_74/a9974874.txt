Abstract    :
              The 1999 International Dictyostelium Meeting will be held August 14-19 in Bar
              Harbor, ME.  This meeting brings together researchers from all over the world
              to discuss the latest advances in research on this important model system. 
              Support is requested from the NSF to offset some of the cost of the meeting and
              to allow investigators with limited grant support to attend the meeting.  The
              focus of these travel awards will be on new investigators, as well as women and
              minority post-doctoral fellows and graduate students in order to increase their
              representation among the attendees.
