The proposed archaeological study examines
              relationships between prehistoric Siberian and Alaskan groups at Wales. 
              Methods include archaeological documentation of natural and cultural deposits,
              radiocarbon dating, and faunal analysis.  Findings will shed light on the
              origins, development, and dynamics of Western Thule culture and the prehistoric
              practice of whaling.
