Kottak  /  O'Leary
	As the global economy reaches more distant parts
              of the world, traditional societies are confronted with an array of new
              commodities.  The first mass produced commodities to reach local markets are
              often packaged and processed foods, which carry with them a high social
              standing as they represent the "modern" urban centers.  This dissertation
              research proposal by an anthropology student from the University of Michigan
              will study the process of household food selection in two fishing communities
              of Northeastern Brazil, one whose economy is stagnant and another which is
              developing a tourist economy. The student will test hypotheses about social
              status and food beliefs and preferences and investigate the cultural
              associations and values of new foods through ethnographic as well as survey
              methods.  The new knowledge form this study will advance our understanding of
              how food consumption varies with economic status, an how food consumption is
              used by traditional communities to create and uphold social and economic
              divisions among residents. In addition the research will contribute to the
              training of a young social scientist and advance our knowledge about this
              important region of the world.
