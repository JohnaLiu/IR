Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Research Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              biophysics and is entitled "Computational and theoretical investigation of the
              protein folding mechanism and protein design:  topological and energetic
              effects."  The  goal of this research is to explore how topological structural
              information governs the sequence designability  of the native conformation, and
              how native topology along with energetic sequence information controls
              the
protein folding mechanism.   It uses an analytical framework and detailed
              numerical simulations to give a full
understanding of the molecular
              mechanisms.  This new approach will be helpful for further developments in
              structural prediction methods and design of novel proteins.
