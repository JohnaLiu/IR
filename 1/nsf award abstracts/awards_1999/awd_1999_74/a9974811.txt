Abstract    :
              Certain fish known as weakly electric fish produce motor commands that do not
              activate muscles, but produce a regularly repeated discharge from small
              electric organs in the body, and they have electroreceptor cells in the skin
              that detect these electric waveforms.  The electric field produced around the
              body can be used for navigation (as with echolocation by sound) and for
              communication between animals.  Mechanisms in the brain detect the timing and
              spatial distortions of the electrosensory waveform with a very high precision. 
              When two animals with similar discharge rates approach each other, the one with
              the slightly higher frequency shifts its own discharge higher, and the lower
              one shifts still lower, and this response is known as the 'jamming avoidance
              response' by analogy to the way two radio stations keep their signals separate
              to avoid having one signal interfere, or 'jam', with the other.  The
              electrosensory pathways in the brain of some electric fish have been well
              studied, and provide an excellent simpler model for more advanced and complex
              central sensory systems such as vision or audition.  This project carries the
              analysis to the cellular level with sophisticated methodology for recording and
              identifying the structure of single cells, to examine how the separate inputs
              of spatial and temporal information are detected and combined within single
              nerve cells in the brain.
   Results will provide a sophisticated cellular
              analysis of how timing and spatial information are integrated in a sensory
              pathway in the brain, and so contribute to understanding basic principles of
              information processing in the brain for particular behaviors.
