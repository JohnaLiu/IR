Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Research Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              ecosystem studies and is entitled "The response of soil carbon turnover and
              storage to global climate change:  a synthesis of modeling and radiocarbon
              data."  Dynamic modeling is a powerful approach to understanding carbon
              accumulation and turnover in terrestrial soils.  This study combines carbon
              turnover estimates from radiocarbon measurements from a range of sites with
              modeling simulations to validate model predictions of the exchange of carbon
              between soils and the atmosphere in response to global climate change.
