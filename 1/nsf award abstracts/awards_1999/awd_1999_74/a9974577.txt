Abstract    :
              This study is concerned with the weight given to a child's testimony in child
              sexual abuse cases.  Sixty-four individuals, 32 professionals and 32 student
              proxies will read and evaluate interview transcripts along a number of
              dimensions.  Each person will evaluate three scenarios that manipulate
              characteristics of the interviewer, characteristics of the interview itself,
              and techniques used in interviewing.  The effort will be to determine which
              factors participants find to be salient in judging the credibility of children
              and other matters related to these cases.  If interviewers and factfinders are
              knowledgeable about and can recognize the factors that produce suggestibility
              in child interviews, then we can be more confident that the judicial system is
              less likely to falsely convict or wrongly acquit the accused in sexual abuse
              cases.  If not, there are implications for needed training for professionals
              who interview children, judges who rule on the admissibility of child
              interviews, and jurors who must evaluate this evidence.
