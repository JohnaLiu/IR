Abstract    :
              Pichersky
The flowers of many plants synthesize and emit scent as a means of
              attracting pollinators, and low seed/fruit set could result if the plant is not
              successful in the competition for the attention of locally available
              pollinators. Benzenoid esters, including methylsalicylate, are among the most
              common, and most efficacious, scent volatiles that flowers emit to attract
              moths and other insect pollinators. Yet, until the recent work from the lab of
              the principle investigator, little had been known about how plants synthesize
              them. In this project, Dr. Pichersky's lab will continue the biochemical and
              structural characterization of two benzenoid ester-forming enzymes that his lab
              recently identified, including the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of
              methylsalicylate. They will also identify and characterize a key enzyme that
              acts at an earlier step in the pathway and that is responsible for the
              shortening of the carbon skeleton of the benzoic acid precursor from C9 to C7.
              In addition to the biochemical characterization of these enzymes, they will
              determine their cellular and subcellular localization and the mode of
              regulation of the genes encoding them.
This project should result in a
              substantial enhancement of the understanding of this important plant
              biochemical pathway, and  the isolation of the genes could eventually lead to
              the ability to manipulate floral volatiles in agronomically important crops to
              enhance visitation frequencies by insect pollinators and thereby increase
              fruit/seed yields.
