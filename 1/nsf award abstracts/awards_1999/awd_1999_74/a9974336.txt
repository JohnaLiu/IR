Abstract    :
              Kenneth Showalter of West Virginia University is supported by a grant from The
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program  to continue his experimental
              research in the area of spatiotemporal dynamics in chemical systems.  
              Showalter proposes three main lines of research: 1) studies of
              perturbation-induced spatiotemporal behavior; 2) the development of
              chemomechanical gel systems that respond to chemical waves and patterns; and 3)
              studies of spatiotemporal behavior in gas phase reactions.  Experimental
              investigations will be combined with theoretical and computational analyses in
              each case.

The study of nonlinear dynamics is an important tool for
              understanding complexity in nature.   The dynamics of most biological systems
              involves spatiotemporal behavior, which remains a challenging and important
              topic in nonlinear dynamics.   Chemical systems play an important role in
              advancing our understanding of nonlinear dynamics because they are particularly
              amenable to experimental and theoretical analyses and hence serve as ideal
              model systems.   Showalter's research serves to elucidate the fundamental
              characteristics of chemical systems that exhibit pattern formation and complex
              space-time behavior.
