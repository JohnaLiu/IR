Abstract    :
              Martin 9974144
Vertebrate genomes are immensely complex, including about
              100,000 protein-coding genes.  Much of the complexity of protein-coding genes
              stems from gene duplication.  Genes can also be lost from the genome, sometimes
              by the same mechanisms that create new genes.  This process of the birth and
              death of genes governs the complexity of the genome.
	This project is
              concerned with the evolutionary history of one gene family, the heat shock 70
              gene family (hsp70).  Heat shock genes are of fundamental importance for cells.
               They are an ancient and highly conserved gene family involved in response to
              cellular stress, in protein folding and assembly, and in transport processes
              across cell membranes.  In addition to the information that can be gained about
              the evolution and diversification of heat shock genes, the proposed research
              asks whether phylogenetic analysis of complex gene families provides
              information about organismal phylogenies.  Thus, the proposed research will be
              of fundamental interest to cell, molecular, and organismal biologists
              interested in the underlying genetic basis of the well known heat shock
              response; to molecular evolutionary geneticists interested in genome and gene
              family evolution, and to systematists interested in reconstructing the history
              of life on Earth.
