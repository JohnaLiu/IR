Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University
              will acquire an upgrade of an X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including studies of organomolybdenum and
              organoiron chemistry; multiply bonded phosphorus centers; chemistry of
              iodosylbenzene; photoactive materials for photodynamic therapy; organic
              synthesis; stereocontrolled dicopper complexes with binucleating ligands;
              cobalt porphyrins as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction
modification of
              proteins by lipid & sugar oxidation products; and transamination catalyzed by
              amine oxidases

The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise
              measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including
              bond distances and angles and accurate information about the spatial
              arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
