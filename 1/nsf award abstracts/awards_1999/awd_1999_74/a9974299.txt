Abstract    :
              Prostaglandins ( type of eicosanoid molecule) are extremely important in mammals
              and other vertebrates.  Cyclooxygenase, which converts arachidonic acid to
              prostaglandins, is the target for most of the widely used anti-inflammatory
              drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, etc.  A prostaglandin E2 receptor has been
              identified in the salivary glands of the lone star tick, demonstrating for the
              first time, a prostaglandin receptor in an invertebrate.  Prostaglandin E2,
              through its receptor, stimulates secretion of saliva protein clearly
              demonstrating a function for an eicosanoid in tick salivary gland
              physiology.

The proposal research by Dr. Sauer will identify all eicosanoids
              in tick salivary glands.  Research will also analyze syntheis of prostaglandin
              E2 and whether synthesis is sensitive to some of the same anti-inflamatory
              drugs shown to effective in inhibiting synthesis in mammals and other
              vertebrates.  The research will also exaimen the mode of action of
              prostaglandin E2 in eliciting secretion of saliva protein.

As more is
              learned about the tick's physiology it may be possible to develop agents (e.g.
              drugs which target protaglandin systensis enzymes) or other treatments that
              will neutralize the harm caused by tick feeding.
