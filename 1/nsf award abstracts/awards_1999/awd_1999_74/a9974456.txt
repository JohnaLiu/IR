Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Point Loma Nazarene College will
              acquire a Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
              undergraduate research in a number of areas, including halogenation of model
              compounds of the humic acids in methanol; and electrophilic versus radical
              reactions of halogen systems with perfluoroalkenes & perfluorodienes.

The
              use of Gas Chromatograph-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to provide the separation
              and identification of complex mixtures is a valuable part of any undergraduate
              research program.  GC-MS is a technique used to probe intimate structural
              details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic,
              bioorganic, and organometallic molecules.  These studies will advance our
              understanding of the processes resulting in halogenated compounds in treated
              waters, which is important to environmental chemistry and also to the
              toxicology and human health areas.
