Dr. Bradbury will study the contact calls of wild Orange-Fronted
              Parakeets (Aratinga canicularis) in Costa Rica. Although each individual
              appears to have its own variant, calls of birds from the same social units
              appear to be convergent.  Dr. Bradbury and associates will record radio-tracked
              wild birds over time to determine how and why calls change with social
              affiliation. They will combine birds from different flocks in an aviary,
              monitor how calls change with new group formation, and monitor subsequent
              changes after release to the wild. Finally, they will synthesize digital copies
              of known birds' calls, modify them in specific ways, and use playbacks to the
              birds' mates to determine which variations in calls are used in recognition
              tasks.

Little is known about how parrots use vocal learning in the wild.
              Parrots differ from many songbirds in mating for life, using vocal signals for
              social affiliation instead of territorial defense, and relying on different
              parts of the brain for vocal communication. Evidence suggests that parrot calls
              may provide closer parallels to human speech than do songbird songs.  Dr.
              Bradbury will provide ecological data for Costa Rican parrot conservation
              programs, and train US and Costa Rican students as part of the study.
