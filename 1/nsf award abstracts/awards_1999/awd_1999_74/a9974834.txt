Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University will
              purchase a High-Performance Parallel Computer. This equipment will enhance
              research in  a variety of areas including 1) studies of the electrodynamics of
              single molecule trapping; 2) studies of the transition states for the
              oxygen/water cycle in biology; 3) computational quantum chemistry of the
              electronic structure of molecules containing a transition metal; 4) research
              and education involving studies of  materials; mechanisms, intermediates &
              spectroscopic analysis; 5) quantum theory of molecular electronic structure; 6)
              molecular properties and spectroscopy; and 7) reaction dynamics.

A
              workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to
              satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network"
              also serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and
              algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities,
              and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel
              processing.
