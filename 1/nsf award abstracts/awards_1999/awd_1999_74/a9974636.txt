Abstract    :
              Cells respond to changes in the nutritional environment by regulating gene
              expression, thereby controlling and coordinating metabolism and cell division. 
              The focus of this project is on Rap1p and Gcr1p, which are DNA-binding
              regulatory proteins found in the nucleus of the model eukaryote, Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae.  They mediate expression of genes that encode two important classes
              of metabolic proteins:  translational components and glycolytic enzymes.  Rap1p
              recruits Gcr1p to specific DNA binding sites upstream from the target genes. 
              Preliminary results have demonstrated that both proteins are phosphorylated. 
              These studies will be expanded to elucidate both the significance of these
              post-translational modifications, and other signaling components involved that
              might convey signals from the sensory mechanisms at the cell surface.  Two
              potential connections between phosphorylation and Rap1p/Gcr1p function are of
              particular interest.  First, Rap1p is phosphorylated within a single tryptic
              phosphopeptide, and is degraded upon nutrient starvation in a Gcr1p-dependent
              fashion.  Second, although Gcr1p contains many tryptic phosphopeptides, a
              single species disappears in the absence of Gcr2p, an ancillary factor that is
              required for Rap1p/Gcr1p transcriptional activation of glycolytic genes only. 
              Importantly, the Gcr2p-dependent phosphopeptide reappears in a Dgcr2 suppressor
              strain in which normal growth and glycolytic enzyme levels are restored.  These
              and other potential regulatory roles of phosphorylation in this system will be
              investigated. The results should contribute to an understanding of the
              important relationship between environmental sensing and the control of
              cellular metabolism in eukaryotes.
