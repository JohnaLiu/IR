Abstract    :
                      The proposal is to provide funds that will greatly increase the ability
              of graduate students to attend the 1999 annual meeting of the Society for
              Behavioral Neuroendocrinology.  This new Society, which has a membership of
              over 350, fosters communication and interdisciplinary collaboration among
              research scientists who are studying how hormones act on the brain.  These
              hormonal actions include: growth and maturation of the brain, the mechanisms by
              which we respond to stress, seasonal and other rhythmic changes in mood and
              behavior, effects on brain of hormones and hormone-like chemicals that are
              released into the environment, effects on brain of hormones involved in the
              control of reproduction and fertility of humans and domesticated animals,
              psychological effects related to stress and reproduction, etc.  The Society
              brings together scientists who are involved at many levels of discovery,
              including the molecular, cellular, systems, and behavioral levels.  The Society
              has adopted the founding principle that annual meetings will be
              student-friendly and will emphasize bringing young investigators into the
              field.  Specific events are directed specifically to the needs of graduate
              students.  The funds will allow significant reduction in registration fees for
              students.
