Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              eukaryotic genetics and is entitled "Methods for characterizing the effect of
              maternal genes on the expression of early developmental traits in
              offspring."
Genes expressed in mothers often influence the expression of
              traits in their offspring.  These so-called maternal effects are ubiquitous but
              have traditionally been ignored in studies of genetic architecture (e.g., QTL
              analysis). Methods are being developed to incorporate maternal effects into QTL
              analyses and apply these methods to examine the genetics of development in the
              mouse.
