Abstract    :
              This project uses a combination of experimental and computational approaches to
              study the mechanisms of gas phase organic reactions.  the gas phase work
              provides information on the intrinsic reactivity of species in the absence of
              solvation.  Comparision with condensed-phase data will give insight into the
              effects of solvation and ion-pairing on the mechanism.  Using a substrate in
              which one ion undergoes a chemical reaction while another remains intact, mass
              spectrophotometric data will be obtained for characterization of the reaction
              product.   In this way, gas phase substitution and elimination reactions will
              be studied.

With this Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Award,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Scott
              Gronert of San Francisco State University.  Professor Gronert's research
              explores the outcomes of chemical reactions in the gas phase, in the absence of
              solvent molecules.  In this way, it may be possible to more fully understand
              the fundamental nature of these reaction and, by comparison with the same
              reactions carried out in solvent, conclusions may be reached with regard to the
              role of solvent molecules in mediating chemical reactions.
