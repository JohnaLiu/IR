One of the most important
              features of Java is its support for portability.  The cost of portability,
              however, is program performance-JVM interpretation of a portable program is
              terribly slow.  Performance is greatly enhanced by the use of the Just-In-Time
              (JIT) compilers.  However, every machine cycle spent by a JIT compiler in one
              less cycle available for program execution, thus limiting the quality and
              aggressiveness of both JIT analysis and optimization.  This project focuses on
              reducing the cost of JIT techniques-improving optimization-by annotating the
              bytecodes to convey more accurate and aggressive analysis and optimization
              information.  The research centers on five objectives:

1. identification of
              a suitable of annotations,
2. development of a Java compiler for producing
              annotations,
3. development of an annotation-aware JIT compilers,
4.
              integration into computer architecture and compiler design curricula,
5.
              experimentation, evaluation and publication.

The results will have immediate
              scientific, industrial ad educational impact.  Annotations represent a new
              solution to the growing problem of delayed optimizations. Enable software and
              hardware firms to improve the performance of their Java-based systems, and
              yield a rich source of discussions/projects for students.
