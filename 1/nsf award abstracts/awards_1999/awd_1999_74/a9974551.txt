Abstract    :
              The award will support a conference on mathematical models for interfaces in
              fluid 
mechanics and materials processing, to be held on August 16-18, 1999 in
              Monterey, CA.  
The meeting will bring together leading researchers in
              interface problems in order to 
discuss the current state of the art and to
              assess the commonality of approaches used 
to model interfaces and solve for
              their evolution.  The participants will include applied 
mathematicians,
              engineers, and scientists from academia, government laboratories, and
              
industry who are working on these problems. This conference will present a
              unique and 
timely opportunity for these communities to come together in an
              informal atmosphere to 
assess the current state of the art and to identify
              the important research problems for the future.

Interfaces are free or
              moving boundaries that occur between two different material phases.
They are
              found in a wide range of fluid mechanics and materials processing problems in
              a
variety of different industrial processes and everyday phenomena, ranging
              from water drops 
in a hot pan to coating films on a solid surface. A better
              understanding and the successful 
manipulation of such boundaries could lead
              to process improvements with wide benefits.
