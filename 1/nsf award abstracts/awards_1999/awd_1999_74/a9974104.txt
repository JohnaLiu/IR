This project will focus on gathering molecular, vocal, and
              morphological data for three co-distributed and ecologically distinct
              Neotropical birds from sites throughout Amazonia.  With these data sets, we
              will address questions about genetic structure, its relationship to vocal,
              morphological and behavioral evolution, its implications for Amazonian
              biogeography and conservation, and neutral evolution of mitochondrial DNA.  The
              general relevance of this research lies in the comparative nature of the data
              to be gathered.  If we hope to create strong testable hypotheses about the
              processes that have led to diversification of birds or the tropics in general,
              evolutionary information is essential.  These will be among the first large
              data sets for Amazonian organisms.  As a result, the data have immediate
              relevance to general questions on Amazonian biogeography.  In addition, our
              multi-taxon approach will provide a baseline from which we can study the
              historical consequences of ecological specialization in tropical organisms.
