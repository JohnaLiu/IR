Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University will
              acquire an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including the following: a) template-based method
              for preparing monodisperse metal nanoparticles for catalysts; b)
              spatially-resolved placement of cells on lithographically defined substrates;
              c) surface functionalization; d) hyperbranched grafting at surfaces using
              'living' low temperature radical polymerization; e) 'smart' heterogeneous
              catalysts
design, f) synthesis and characterization of molecular assemblies
              and polymeric molecule-based paramagnetic materials; g) analysis of
              interactions at interfaces; and h) studies of the nature of a surface and its
              impact on electrochemical properties of alloy electrodes.  


The X-ray
              photoelectron spectrometer (XPS)  is used for chemical analysis.  It irradiates
              a sample with a beam of monochromatic X-rays and the energies of the resulting
              photoelectrons are measured and related to specific elements.  XPS often plays
              a crucial role in defining the system under study.  The work to be carried out
              by these investigators represents a highly coherent attack on a range of issues
              at the forefront of materials chemistry.
