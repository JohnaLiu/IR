Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.


The research and training plan is in the area of
              population biology and is entitled "Natural selection 'in the wild:' use of a
              high-density linkage map to detect loci affecting fitness in pink salmon." It 
              focuses on extending and developing computational tools to analyze an extensive
              dataset resulting from a large-scale release and return genetic study of pink
              salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha).  Genotypes at approximately 50 loci from 50
              families (bred using wild-caught parents) are being analyzed with reference to
              a high-density linkage map to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs)
              controlling phenotypes influencing marine survival in this commercially
              important and biologically interesting anadromous species.
