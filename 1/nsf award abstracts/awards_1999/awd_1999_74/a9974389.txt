     The investigators and her colleagues study and analyze
              the
complex interactions between parasitic trematodes and their
invertebrate
              and vertebrate hosts by developing mathematical
models that allow the
              prediction of changes in the population
dynamics of both hosts and parasites. 
              Continuous deterministic
models based on systems of differential equations are
              proposed
and analyzed using the theory of dynamical systems and integral
and
              differential equations.  Data gathered for the validation of
the models is
              fitted using standard statistical techniques.
Validation of the simpler
              initial models is done by taking the
prevalence values of infection of human
              hosts at two or more
points in time, and estimating prevalence of infection at
              other
points in time for which data is available.
     A collaborative study
              is undertaken that combines the
theoretical and empirical experience of a
              parasitologist and the
modeling and theoretical expertise of mathematicians
              to
investigate models of host-parasite interactions.  The scope of
this
              project is threefold:
     *First, to model host-parasite interactions,
              with
increasingly complex models motivated by biological
considerations;
   
               *second, the study of mathematical properties of each model
and their
              biological and ecological implications such as
population control or potential
              species extinction;
     *third, the validation of the models through
              comparison of
model results with field data.  This project
              significantly
advances our knowledge and understanding of the dynamics
              of
host-parasite systems, by providing usable models to study
natural
              systems, by analyzing their sensitivity to the parameters
affecting their
              dynamics, and by allowing the structuring of the
complexities of the systems
              into hierarchies.  A specific example
is the determination of the proportion
              of cases of
schistosomiasis that need to be treated for the disease to
              be
eradicated, as well as the effect of drug-induced parasite
mutation and
              the existence of more than one species of definitive
hosts on the dynamics of
              transmission of this ailment.  Just as
important is the possibility of
              extending the models developed in
this project to more complex systems
              involving three or more
species, or stochastic environmental variability.
