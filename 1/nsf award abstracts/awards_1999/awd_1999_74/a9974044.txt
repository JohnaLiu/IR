This grant provides publication subvention for a narrative
              text manuscript for the Emai language of Nigeria.  The narratives were
              assembled prior to grammatical and lexical investigations supported by NSF and
              were revised and updated subsequent to those investigations.  As the only
              extant collection of oral tradition texts for Emai and its Edoid group, the
              texts will interlock with the grammatical and lexical documentation of Emai and
              will serve as reference tools for scholars from a range of research traditions.
