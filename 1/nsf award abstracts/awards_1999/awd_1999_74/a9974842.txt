Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
              Irvine will acquire a picosecond laser system. This equipment will enhance
              research in the following areas:  1) lifetime measurements for epitaxial
              quantum dots on graphite & silicon; 2) second harmonic generation from
              assymetric metal nanoparticle dimers; 3) an ultra sensitive probe for trace
              gases with applications in atmospheric chemistry and medicine; 4) ionization
              and dissociation dynamics in liquid helium droplets; 5) photogeneration of
              redox intermediates in hemeproteins; 6) photoluminescent supramolecular and
              polymeric systems; and 7) synthesis and chemistry of yttrium and lanthanide
              metal complexes.


A picosecond laser provides ultrafast pulses of coherent
              visible or infrared light, which enables researchers to obtain important
              information about fast occurring chemical reactions.  Its use may enable
              breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive and
              nonreactive molecules.
