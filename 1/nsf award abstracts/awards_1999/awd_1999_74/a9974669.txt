The evolution of color patterns in animals
              has been studied for over a century, but many basic questions are still poorly
              understood.  Why do camouflaged species often occur in multiple, distinctive
              forms?  Why are distasteful animals usually brightly colored?  There is little
              direct evidence bearing on these issues, because it is difficult to conduct
              evolutionary experiments in the laboratory.  The proposed research will explore
              the evolution of color patterns in prey species using blue jays trained to
              search computer displays for the presence of digital "moths." The moths exist
              in an artificial population maintained in computer memory, a "virtual ecology,"
              with a genetic system derived from the genetics of real moths.  They breed and
              evolve through successive generations based on whether jays detect them when
              they are displayed on screen. Changes in their color patterns over time mimic
              many of the evolved features of color patterns in real
              insects.

Predator-prey systems are important both biologically and
              practically.  The proposed research will advance understanding of the complex
              dynamics involved in predator-prey interactions over evolutionary time.  It
              will also test the validity of virtual ecology for studying evolutionary
              dynamics, potentially adding a powerful new technique to the scientific study
              of organic evolution.
