Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to design novel data models for video
              databases that will provide enhanced semantic expressiveness needed for
              content-based retrieval of video data. The key features of such models will be
              to allow retrieval of video data using arbitrary combination of keywords and
              video events involving object motion. Such a hybrid approach can substantially
              enhance the degree of precision and scalability of retrieval mechanisms for
              video data. This research effort is expected to have a significant impact on
              the development of database tools for content-based indexing and retrieval of
              video data. Results of this project are anticipated to have widespread
              applications including those in surveillance, education, digital libraries,
              law-enforcement, tele-medicine, news and entertainment, and manufacturing.
