Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University acquire
              a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer/AC
              susceptometer.  This equipment will enhance research projects ranging from the
              solid state & cluster chemistry of layered MN chalcogenide systems;
              Fe-containing metal-rich compounds; pillared and interstratified zirconium
              phosphates; studies of organometallic molecular wires; magnetic properties of
              molecule-based materials:  design, synthesis and characterization of molecular
              assemblies and molecule-based polymeric materials; interplay of magnetism and
              superconductivity; and magnetic and electronic properties of intermetallics and
              related materials.  

The superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
              magnetometer measures very small currents or voltages and permits precise
              magnetic measurements of materials.
