	This project supports the dissertation
              research of an anthropology student from the University of Chicago studying
              ideologies of language differentiation among the Sundanese people of West Java,
              the second largest ethnic group in Indonesia.  At the present time Indonesian
              society is undergoing rapid change with the end of the long-standing regime of
              President Suharto, and one major issue shared with many parts of the world is
              the relation of ethnic minorities to the national state. Through a fine-grained
              analysis of linguistic interaction in two fieldsites (a historically
              aristocratic highland area, and another locale with a complex mixture of
              contemporary cultural influences)  the project aims to understand how Sundanese
              speakers position themselves and others by drawing internal and external
              linguistic boundaries. These boundaries will be based on local models of
              "Sundaneseness" and "Indonesianness" opposing traditional normative refinement
              with modern egalitarian ideals.  This analysis of linguistic self-positioning
              will shed light on how people identify with or against other ethnic groups, and
              will help us understand the roots of local ethnic conflicts.  In addition the
              project supports the training of a young social scientist, and advances our
              knowledge of this important area of the world.
