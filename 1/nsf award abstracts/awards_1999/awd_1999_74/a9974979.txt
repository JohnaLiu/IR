              Generation Software:  ERF:  An Event-Rule Framework for Supporting
              Heterogeneous Distributed Systems 

This proposal presents a plan for
              research and development of an Event-Rule framework (ERF) which comprises of a
              set of services and tools for supporting the development of heterogeneous
              distributed systems (HDS).  The proposed research aims to study design
              alternatives, algorithms, applications, and implementation issues to accomplish
              the following objectives: 1) a high-level object-oriented specification model;
              2) support for multiple standards 3) events and rules used as paradigm for
              specification f behavior of a HDS 4) a Rule-Based Intelligent Event Service
              (RUBIES)  which provides methods for rule definition, event notification
              (posting) registration and rule management; and 5) an integrated development
              environment (IDE) with tools for specifying the structure and behavior, and for
              the run-time monitoring and maintenance of an HDS.
