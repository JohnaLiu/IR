Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona will
              acquire a powder and thin film X-ray diffractometer system. This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including the following: a) small angle
              and wide angle X-ray scattering of molecule-based materials, e.g., rigid
              bilayer thickness films of phthalocyanines; b) characterization of metal ion
              imprinted polymers (MIPs) for high selectivities in separation of various metal
              ions; c) photoresponsive liquid crystals; d) nanocomposites from metallized or
              mineralized polymerized lipid phases; e) structure and function in protein film
              assemblies; f)  laminate planar waveguides for surface spectroscopy and
              chemical sensing; g) dendrimers supported by hexanuclear metal clustsers; and
              h) metal cluster-supported porous solids.

The X-ray diffractometer allows
              accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a
              molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate
              information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
              neighboring molecules.
