The hind limb of a theropod dinosaur is composed of
              seventeen linked segments that undergo cyclical movements during locomotion.
              This morphological, spatial, and temporal complexity is well suited to the
              tools of 3-D animation, which permit a models change in position through time
              to be freely manipulated. However, reconstructing limb function in extinct
              Mesozoic theropods has been problematic, because little direct evidence of limb
              excursion is available. This project will investigate a unique series of Late
              Triassic trackways, which were made by theropods sinking to variable depth.
              Soft substrates intercepted foot movements that would normally occur in air,
              thereby preserving 3-D records of theropod locomotor behavior. Three computer
              techniques will be used. (1) Visualization of the 3-D pathway of the toes using
              high resolution X-ray CT scanning. (2) Reconstruction of foot movement using
              3-D animated track simulation. (3) Modeling of whole limb movements using
              reconstructed foot movements. This novel approach will allow the foot path and
              limb movements of 210 million year old theropods to be reconstructed for the
              first time. These conclusions, derived from footprints rather than skeletons,
              will provide independent evidence to test hypotheses of theropod functional
              evolution. The computer-based methodology will offer an example of how graphics
              and animation can contribute to the quantification, analysis, and communication
              of complex paleontological material.
