Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Massachusetts
              in Amherst will acquire a CCDbased X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including the following: a) synthesis of
              novel olefin polymerization catalysts; b) biomimetic solid-state syntheses of
              inorganic/organic composites; c) crystal structures of stable radicals and
              related precursor substances; d) studies of metallobiomolecules and synthetic
              model approaches; e) crystal engineering using functionalized diaminotriazines;
              and f) the design and construction of solid state materials using 'crystal
              engineering'.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise
              measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including
              bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the
              spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
