Abstract    :
              Taleff

This award will provide partial support for the acquisition of a
              high-temperature mechanical system for materials testing and processing.  This
              system includes two pieces of equipment, an electro-mechanical universal
              testing machine and a high-temperature, vacuum/inert-gas furnace.  It will be
              used for research on (i) mechanical testing of materials at temperatures up to
              2000 degrees C in vacuum and inert-gas atmospheres; and (ii) processing of
              ceramic materials by hot pressing at temperatures up to 2000 degrees C.

The
              instrument will significantly enhance current and planned research and
              educational activities at the University of Texas at Austin.  It is a critical
              enabler for new research projects that cannot currently be pursued by both
              investigators for lack of facilities.

***
The equipment will be used to
              train graduate students on an individual basis, as well as within research
              groups on campus, and for their research studies.
