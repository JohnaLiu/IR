Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Harvard University will acquire
              an FEI DualBeam 820 focused ion beam workstation.  This instrument will
              facilitate research in a number of areas, including a) studies of step coverage
              in chemical vapor deposition of thin films; b) deposition of barrier materials;
              c) high dielectric constant materials; d) electrical properties of
              one-dimensional nanostructures;  e) construction of nanotube probe microscopy
              tips; f) high resolution near-field fluorescence microscopy with nanofabricated
              metal tips for spectroscopic imaging of photosynthetic membranes; and g)
              near-field coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy studies of biological
              membranes.  

A focused ion beam (FIB) in conjunction with a field-emission
              scanning electron microscope allows high-resolution in-situ imaging/monitoring
              of the nanofabrication process.  The ability of FIB to fabricate and manipulate
              materials at the namometer scale is indispensable to the materials chemist
              since this length scale, which bridges both molecular and bulk systems, is
              expected to be the focus of much of chemical research in the future.
