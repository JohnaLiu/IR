The objective of this project on point defect migration in
              perovskite thin films is to develop a better understanding of electric
              field--induced oxygen vacancy motion in high-permittivity dielectric layers. 
              The technological motivation for this work is derived from concerns about the
              reliability of perovskite dielectrics for integrated on-chip capacitors. 
              Field-driven oxygen vacancy migration is a key feature of the proposed
              mechanisms for time-dependent degradation of these films.  However, unambiguous
              physical characterization of oxygen vacancy electro-migration has not been
              reported to date in the high permitivity thin film systems of technological
              interest.  In this project, vacancy migration kinetics will be measured and the
              data used to test proposed mechanisms for fatigue, imprint, and resistance
              degradation of perovskite dielectrics.  Combined with measurements of
              ferroelectric hysteresis and charge transport across the dielectrics, the
              kinetic data may allow the development of quantitative and predictive models
              for the degradation processes.

The proposed research project combines
              experiments and modeling to improve our understanding of behavior of a class of
              materials that have immense technological importance in integrated circuit
              applications.  The project will provide the students with a special educational
              experience through collaborative work (including extended visits and
              jointly-planned experiments) involving industrial researchers at
              Hewlett-Packard Laboratories and IBM's T.J. Watson Research Lab.
