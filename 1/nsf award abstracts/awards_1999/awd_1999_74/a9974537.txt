This is a proposal to operate the High Resolution Fly's Eye
              (HiRes) observatory.  This detector, located at the US Army's Dugway Proving
              Ground in Utah, is composed of two stations 12.7 km apart.  It detects ultra
              high energy cosmic rays via nitrogen fluorescence in the atmosphere.  The
              observatory is scheduled to be completed in the summer of 1999.  This proposal
              is for the first 2 1/2 years of full operation.  
The goals of the experiment
              are the study of the spectrum, composition, and anisotropy of cosmic rays of
              energies from 10^18 eV to beyond 10^20 eV.  Previous experiments, including the
              original Fly's Eye experiment, have shown evidence that the spectrum continues
              past the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff.
The nature of the events above the
              cutoff is a puzzle which has stimulated much theoretical speculation.  The
              HiRes detector will have an order of magnitude greater sensitivity than the
              previous  Fly's Eye experiment.  The project is a collaboration between the
              University of Utah, Columbia University, the University of Adelaide, the
              University of New Mexico, UCLA, and Montana State University.
The educational
              outreach program, called "ASPIRE",  provides direct access, via the internet, 
              by Utah students and teachers to current research in astrophysics and produces
              interactive on-line physics lessons for use in K-12 classrooms and distance
              learning.  The ASPIRE activity is supported jointly by the MPS Division of
              Physics and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).
