Our work has shown that the homeotic gene Floricaula/LEAFY
              (LFY) can provide very strong evidence on phylogenetic relationships of major
              plant taxonomic groups.  This is due mostly to the slow rate of change of the
              amino acid sequence of the gene, and partly because a gene duplication  cut a
              "long branch" early in the evolution of seed plants.  We will obtain LFY
              sequences to address relationships among 1) the major spore bearing groups
              (leptosporangiate ferns, Botrychium (of the Eusporangiate ferns), horsetails,
              Psilotum and seed plants, and perhaps also liverworts, mosses and lycopods and
              2) the basal flowering plant groups, including such plants as waterlily,
              Magnolia, Drimys Ceratophyllum, etc.  Our most parsimonious gene tree shows the
              duplication event preceding the separation of the flowering plant lineage.  If
              true, this would mean flowering plants originally had a second copy of the LFY
              gene, which was subsequently lost.  This observation suggests an alternative
              theory of flower evolution, based on developmental genetics.  This part of the
              gene tree is uncertain, however, making the theory weakly supported. The same
              sequence data needed for phylogenetic analysis of the major plant groups should
              also more firmly establish the order of splittings in the gene tree.  This may
              show, with more certainty, whether the duplication preceded the divergence of
              flowering plants, and so whether flowering plants had a second LFY gene that
              was lost.
