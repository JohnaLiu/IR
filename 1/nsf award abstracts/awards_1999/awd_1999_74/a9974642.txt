Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Northeastern University will
              purchase a Molecular Modeling System. This equipment will enhance research in 
              a variety of areas including conformational analysis and molecular modeling of
              substituted steroids; protein and DNA dynamics studies using spin-labeling with
              molecular modeling; synthesis of medicinal agents such as tamoxifen analogs;
              molecular modeling of drug-receptor interactions and drug-drug similarities;
              computational studies of horseradish peroxidase in nonaqueous media; modeling
              enzyme-substrate interactions in vitamin B6 mediated systems; and new DNA
              cleaving and crosslinking reagents.

A workstation network of fast, modern
              computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry
              departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development environment
              for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics and
              visualization facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art
              applications of parallel processing.
