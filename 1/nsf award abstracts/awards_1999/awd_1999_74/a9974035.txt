This project will investigate the effects of short-
              and long-term disturbances on tropical cloud forest canopy communities building
              upon 12 years of previous research.  It will consider forest-canopy plants and
              invertebrates while assessing the response of the forest as a whole.  It will
              compare canopy plant and insect communities in a primary forest with those in
              an adjacent secondary forest.  It will conduct transplant and greenhouse
              experiments that mimic the global change patterns predicted for tropical
              montane forests.  Responses will be assessed for plant leaf mortality and
              production, non-vascular plants, invertebrate community diversity and trophic
              structure, and nutrient cycling and conservation.  Results will be archived and
              disseminated widely for researchers, policy makers and the general public.
