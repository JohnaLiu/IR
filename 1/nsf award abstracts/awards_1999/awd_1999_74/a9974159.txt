Ecologists have hypothesized for decades that more diverse
              communities are more difficult for species to invade because greater species
              richness should leave less available resources for a potential invader to
              exploit. This research seeks to address three fundamental questions (1) Does
              diversity influence invasibility of communities? (2) Do functional attributes
              of invaders related to resource acquisition influence the success of their
              invasion? (3) Is there a greater probability of invasion success when the
              invader differs from community members in functional attributes related to
              resource capture? The experimental design allows separation of effects due to
              differences in plant composition from effects due to differences in functional
              group richness. Unlike previous studies that have inferred answers to these
              questions by surveying communities which have already been invaded, this
              project will directly test the patterns of invasion into communities that
              differ in both composition and richness of plant functional groups. It will
              study the role of competition as a mechanism involved in invasion outcome. The
              research will use already-established experimental communities in California
              serpentine grassland. These experimental communities allow control of several
              factors, including disturbance regime, soil fertility, and community history,
              which confound attempts to study these questions in already invaded ecosystems.
              By directly seeding in species that are not already a part of those
              experimental communities, but that occur in the local area, it also will be
              possible to control for the rate of propagule arrival. This control is critical
              for determining what limits the success of an invasion once propagules have
              arrived. Overall, this set of experiments will provide a direct test of
              hypotheses concerning community invasibility and its underlying mechanisms.
