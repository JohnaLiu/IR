Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Research Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              metabolic biochemistry and is entitled "A computer program to predict the
              biodegradation of environmental pollutants."  This project concerns the
              environmental breakdown of pollutants by microbial action, biodegradation.  An
              artificially intelligent system capable of predicting the biodegradation
              pathways of novel compounds will be developed by combining two existing
              databases.   Automated learning techniques to populate a knowledge base with
              biodegradation knowledge will be devised.  This will be used in an expert
              system to predict multiple potential biodegradation pathways.
