Abstract    :
              Fast axonal transport, the anterograde and retrograde movement of vesicles and
              mitochondria in the neuronal axon, is a fundamental process in nerve cells.  It
              is now well established that the transport of vesicles requires cytoskeletal
              filaments (both microtubules and actin microfilaments) and molecular motors
              (kinesin, dynein, and myosin).  It is also well established that vesicles are
              targeted to either the axon or dendrites to maintain cell polarity, and that
              anterograde and retrograde transport are coordinated to maintain the proper
              distribution of organelles throughout the cell.

The long-term objectives of
              this project are to determine the role of myosin and actin filaments in fast
              axonal transport. In particular, the role of myosin V in vesicle transport will
              be determined. Recently published data from Dr. Langford's laboratory has shown
              that myosin V transports ER vesicles in the squid giant axon. 

The specific
              aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that the membrane receptor for
              myosin V is a member of the protein 4.1 family of proteins and that the DIL
              motif of myosin V is involved in its binding to vesicles. Several approaches to
              determine the membrane proteins to which myosin binds will be used: (1)
              Affinity column chromatography will be performed with a synthetic peptide used
              to produce the myosin-V function-blocking antibody. Extracts of axoplasm and
              squid brain homogenates will be passed over the column and specific interacting
              proteins recovered. (2) Cross-linking reagents will be used to couple myosin V
              to its binding partners in the vesicle membrane and co-immunoprecipitation will
              be used to isolate the myosin
complex. (3) Dominant-negative constructs will
              be expressed to determine whether the DIL motif represents the membrane binding
              sequence. The full-length clone of squid myosin-V has been obtained by RT-PCR.
              The myosin-V gene will be fused to GFP and the fusion construct ligated into an
              expression vector for myosin V expression in cultured cells.  The three
              experimental plans of this specific aim will be conducted in parallel.
