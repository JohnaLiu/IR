Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Research Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              systematic biology and is entitled "Automated mapping of plant distributions
              and mining of biological, geological, and geographical data by parsing locality
              descriptions on
specimen labels."  Museum and herbarium specimen labels rarely
              contain specific geographical coordinates,
but often provide physical and
              biological descriptions of where a specimen was collected.  These descriptions
              are being automatically parsed and compared to physical and biological data
              stored in a geographical information system (GIS) to generate probabilistic
              models of taxon distributions.
