Abstract    :
              Mike Zerner of the University of Florida is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to investigate the effect of solvation on
              molecular structures, spectroscopic properties, and chemical reactivities with
              theoretical methods.  He proposes to examine solvation models of both the
              reaction field and mixed quantum/classical types.  For the former, he will
              re-examine cavity size and shape, and their relation to heat of solvation.  For
              the latter he will study the nature of dispersion interactions between solvent
              and solute.  Applications cover topics such as aromaticity, electrophilic
              substitution, electron transfer, and nonlinear optical properties.

Although
              most electronic structure theories relate directly to molecular systems in the
              gas phase, much of chemistry occurs in condensed phases.  Properties such as
              aromaticity are very dependent on the effects of solution, as are the rates and
              energetics of processes such as electron transfer.  Additionally, non-linear
              optical properties in condensed phases are sensitive to polarizable media.  To
              describe environmental effects, specifically solvation, useful tools are needed
              to integrate smoothly with existing advanced techniques for the electronic
              structures of isolated systems.
