Abstract    :
              Dr. Charles G. Riordan, Chemistry Department, University of Delaware is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program to develop
              the coordination and bioinorganic chemistry of the poly(thioether)borates.
              Significant features of these new ligands include an overall anionic charge,
              highly polarizable thioether donors, and a synthetic versatility that permits
              inocrporation of a range of sulfur substituents. The ligands will be used as
              supporting ligands to investigate the bioinorganic chemistry of zinc, to direct
              the reactivity of tetrahedral cobalt and nickel complexes, and to form three
              coordinate metal thiolate complexes. 

The development of these new species
              is important to accurately model the active sites in metal containing proteins
              and enzymes. In addition, these studies will have broad implications to the
              understanding of a range of catalytic industrial and biological processes.
