Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute
              and State University will purchase an In-Situ Infrared Spectrometer, Gel
              Permeation Chromatograph, and Melt rheometer Ensemble.  This instrumentation
              will facilitate research in the following areas:  a) studies of novel living
              chain growth polymerization; b) melt phase step-growth polymerization; c)
              functional oligomer crosslinking studies d) synthesis of polyketides from
              ketene dimers; e) development of bifunctional catalysts for enolate-based C-C
              forming reactions; f) detection of reactive intermediates; g) dynamics of
              reversible gels; h) melt conversion of phenolic-epoxy materials; i)  flame
              retardant phenolic matrix resins for polymer matrix composites; and j)
              characterization of branching in polyolefins.  

This ensemble of
              instruments, infrared spectrometer, gel permeation chromatograph (GPC), and
              melt rheometer, are critically needed analytical instruments for polymer
              scientists.  They allow the analysis of macromolecules, which tend to be
              insoluble or soluble only in very toxic solvents.  Thus the in-situ
              capabilities of the spectrometer are key.  In addition, the GPC is well-suited
              to handle toxic solvents and high temperature analysis.
