Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Virginia will
              acquire a CCD X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
              number of areas including the study of complexes for asymmetric catalysis;
              metal core macromolecules; small metallacarborane clusters and sandwiches: use
              for directed synthesis and studies of their reactivity and physical properties;
              new transformations for arenes, aromatic heterocycles, dienes, alkynes and
              substituted olefins such as pentaammineosmium(II); enantioselective reactions
              with arenes; organic reactions of heterocycles; alternative dearomatization
              agents; polymer chemistry, catalysis, organometallic chemistry and organic
              synthesis; synthesis of natural products such as cembranes and cembranolides;
              polypropionates; annonaceous acetogenins; glycobiological chemistry; and
              biologically important carbohydrate recognition processes.

The X-ray
              diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
              dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
              it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
              relative to the neighboring molecules.
