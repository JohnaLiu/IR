Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              computational neuroscience and is entitled "Developing hybrids of real-time
              computer neural models and in vivo cells to explore activity dependent
              plasticity of cortical visual receptive fields."  Experience dependent learning
              in local cortical circuits of the primary visual cortex are being studied in
              vivo.  A new computer-based technique called in vivo dynamic clamp is being
              used to construct hybrid networks, where a cortical neuron is reciprocally
              interconnected with real time computer simulated neural models through a
              whole-cell clamp intracellular electrode.   Novel real time data analysis
              methods, such as real time reverse correlation analysis, are being developed. 
              Using these techniques, changes will be induced in the classical receptive
              fields by supervised Hebbian learning, with the computer-generated model neuron
              acting as the teacher.  The use of the hybrid networks will permit the clear
              demonstration that activity dependent learning does take place in the visual
              cortex at the level of a single cell.
