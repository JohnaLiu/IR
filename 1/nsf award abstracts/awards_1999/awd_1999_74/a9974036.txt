Abstract    :
              The project is focused on understanding the phylogeny and evolutionary patterns
              of mimicry in the oedionychinid flea beetles.  This is a large group of 23
              genera, with the phylogenetic relationships not understood.  The beetles are
              diverse, colorful, and involved in numerous mimicry complexes throughout their
              range.  The PIs intend to reconstruct the phylogeny of this group using
              traditional characters of exoskeleton and male genitalia, as well as internal
              features, female genitalia, sensilla, and molecular characters.  Because this
              group is distributed among three continents in tropical areas, elucidating the
              biogeographic patterns will provide a basic framework for understanding the
              role mimicry may have played in diversification.  Analysis of these data,
              separately and combined, will provide powerful tests of hypotheses of
              relatedness, mimicry, and the evolution of this ancient assemblage of beetles.
