Abstract    :
              How does the nervous system control muscles whose function changes with their
              mechanical context? To answer this question, Dr. Chiel is studying muscles in
              an animal, the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, whose biomechanics and
              neural control are both tractable to experimental
analysis. To test the
              hypothesis that the function of the muscles I1/ I3 during feeding are dependent
              on their mechanical context, he will study the changing position of I1/ I3
              relative to other muscles in the feeding apparatus in intact, feeding animals
              using MRI, as well as constructing a detailed kinematic model. Using
              neurophysiological techniques, he will also
determine whether the nervous
              system of the animal exploits the context-dependent properties of the I1/I3
              muscles to generate different movements during biting as opposed to
              swallowing.
The proposed research is likely to suggest principles that will
              clarify the control of context-dependent muscles in higher vertebrates as well
              as in invertebrates. These studies will lead to the development of novel MRI
              imaging techniques that may be applied to many other freely
moving biological
              structures. Finally, these studies suggest a richer view of motor control, in
              which motor patterns are not purely driven by activity of the nervous system,
              but are actively constructed from the dynamics of the body as well as the
              dynamics of the nervous system.
