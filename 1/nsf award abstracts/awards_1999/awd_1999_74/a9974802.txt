Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois in
              Chicago will acquire a solid-state upgrade for a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas, including a) studies of
              phospholipid bilayer phase transitions and lipid-protein interactions; b) solid
              phase synthesis of oligosaccharides containing the beta-mannoside and
              beta-rhamnoside linkages; c) studies of polymeric and inorganic materials; and
              d) investigations on the distribution and dynamical behavior of adsorbed
              species in microporous solids.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access
              to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in
              materials science and biology.
