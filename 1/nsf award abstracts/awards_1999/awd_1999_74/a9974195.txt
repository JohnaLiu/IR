Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Research Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              biophysics and is entitled "Data mining recurrent 3D interaction for protein
              structure prediction."  Data mining of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) is being
              used to identify recurrent non-local interactions (salt bridges, hydrogen
              bonds, and hydrophobic contacts) in three dimensions (3D) between two segments
              of structure greater than 15 amino acids apart.  The resulting databases of 3D 
              interactions will be used for protein structure prediction.
