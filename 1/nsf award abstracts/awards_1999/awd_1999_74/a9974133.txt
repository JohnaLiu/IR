Human activities have come to dominate ecological processes in
              tropical rainforests today. Most research on this topic has focused on direct
              destruction and fragmentation, resulting from logging, agriculture, ranching
              and fire. However, comparatively little information has been gathered about the
              effects of human activities on large areas of protected primary forest. These
              protected areas often were established specifically to protect biological
              diversity, but at present it is unknown how human activities will affect forest
              processes over periods of decades or centuries. As an example, the island of
              Borneo is one of the centers of biological diversity, yet is protected forests
              are increasingly affected by logging, hunting, gathering of forest products and
              lad clearing. Throughout Borneo, such forests are growing ever more isolated by
              massive logging operations and conversion of land to agriculture, and are
              potentially at risk from widespread effects of air pollution and global climate
              change. These forests are also subject to periodic droughts, such as those that
              occurred in 1997 and 1998. This project will examine hypotheses regarding the
              effects of increasing levels of human impacts on forest structure, forest
              dynamics, and species composition at three contrasting protected forests in
              Malaysian Borneo. Trees in these forests have been censused at 5-year intervals
              since 1965 making this among the oldest continuously recorded plots in primary
              tropical rainforest. In this project, a complete re-census of trees will occur
              in 2000, along with some sampling of saplings and seedlings. Analyses will
              compare early census periods to later census periods to determine hoe the
              forest structure, demographic processes, and community composition are changing
              with increasing human activity. As these protected forests in Borneo are
              increasingly affected by human activities, it is vital to assess human impact
              as soon as possible. The information provided by this research will be valuable
              not only for increasing our knowledge of community ecology and forest dynamics,
              but also for effective forest management and park planning.
