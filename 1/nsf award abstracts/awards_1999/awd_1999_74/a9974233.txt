Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Research Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              animal behavior and is entitled "Multi-player dynamic programming game methods,
              with application to evolutionary biology."  Dynamic game models have an
              extensive history in many fields.  In this research, algorithms will be
              developed to explore dynamic programming games between multiple players and
              make these methods and computer algorithms available
to biologists.  To
              demonstrate the method, two popular areas of evolutionary biology, mating
              systems and predator-prey interactions, are being used for the study.
