Retention of Soluble Organic Nutrients in
              Ecosystems during Primary Succession and Soil Development

Primary succession
              is the process of development of an ecosystem on an area which has not been
              previously occupied by plants and animals, such a sand dune or a new volcanic
              debris flow. The establishment of a cycle of fertilizer nutrients (such as N
              and P) on these initially barren infertile sites is an essential part of this
              ecosystem development.  While much of the emphasis on the cycling and leaching
              of nutrients after disturbance and during succession has been focused on
              inorganic nutrients familiar to every farmer -- nitrate, ammonia, and
              phosphate, organic nutrients are also released as vegetation dies and
              decomposes. We propose to define the role of leaching of soluble organic
              nutrients in ecosystem development during primary succession by comparing the
              retention or leaching of organic nutrients to the accumulation of soil
              nutrients, and to determine factors which control leaching of organic
              nutrients.
