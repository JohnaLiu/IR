Abstract    :
              Support is provided for the Fourth International Symposium on Gas Transfer at
              Water Surfaces to be held at Miami Beach, FL, June 5-8, 2000. This meeting is
              the fourth in a sequence of international symposia on this topic. The meeting
              will help develop a deeper understanding of gas transfer in natural systems and
              focus on the following topics: physical and chemical mechanisms, modeling
              biogeochemical cycles, remote sensing, innovative measurement technology,
              laboratory measurements, and field measurements. Support will be provided for
              logistics and administration, travel for student attendees and the program
              committee. This project is jointly supported by the Atmospheric Chemistry, 
              Physical Meteorology, Chemical Oceanography, and Physical Oceanography Programs
              at NSF.
