Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Research Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of cell
              biology and is entitled "Theoretical studies of the interface between cells and
              their environment:  simulating protein motion on the cell membrane."  In this
              study, the diffusive-like lateral motion of membrane proteins will be
              theoretically modeled and simulated.  Emphasis will be placed on understanding
              how internal cellular structure acts to regulate protein diffusion, and to what
              extent this regulation is a dynamic process.  How this diffusion is coupled to
              cellular functioning will be studied by working closely with experimentalists.
