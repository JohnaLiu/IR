As
              part of the activities in 1999 marking the end of Raoul Bott's
formal teaching
              career at Harvard and the 35th anniversary of the
statement and proof of the
              Atiyah-Bott, or Woods Hole theorem, a
meeting will be held October 8-10, 1999
              at the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution. Shimura's original conjecture was
              an
extension of the Lefschetz fixed point theorem for holomorphic
maps and
              projective varieties, announced during the 1964 Summer
Institute in Algebraic
              Geometry at Woods Hole. Bott and Atiyah
realized that there should be a
              general formula for maps
preserving any elliptic operator, or indeed any
              elliptic complex,
and the theorem took shape. Their result and the index
              theorem
underpin the modern relationship between geometry, arithmetic,
and
              physics. Raoul Bott will give an exposition of approaches for
proving the
              theorem and generalizations that motivate current
research. Other lectures
              will cover the development of
pseudodifferential operators in index theory,
              which made possible
a bridge between analysis and the geometry of the
              problem.
Examples will include non-classical ones, like the
              Heisenberg
algebra of pseudodifferential operators on a contact
manifold.
              Atiyah-Singer formulas are obtained for certain
Fredholm operators, and also
              for a class of Fourier integral
operators defined by homogeneous symplectic
              automorphisms of a
cotangent bundle. Other lectures will explain the use of
              an
elementary Morse theory to derive natural Morse functions on
moduli
              spaces, connections of the Atiyah-Bott theorem with
physics, and the
              application of Lefschetz formula methods to the
Harish-Chandra theory of group
              representations.

Before this century there was no sharp line between physics
              and
mathematics.  The divergence between the two fields accelerated,
and by
              the 1950's there was little in common, though physicists
had become
              increasingly adept at using what mathematics was
necessary for their theories.
               Since the 1970's there has been an
extraordinary convergence of mathematics
              and physics in the basic
theories of space and matter.  The Atiyah-Bott fixed
              point
theorem, or Woods Hole theorem, is a landmark mathematical result
from
              the 1960's. This theorem has led to a great number of
applications to problems
              in mathematics, and is an active field
of research. To consider the present
              work and the future
possibilities suggested by the Atiyah-Bott theorem, a
              meeting is
planned for the fall of 1999, in celebration of this work and
              the
career of Raoul Bott. The implications of this research on the
problems
              common to both physics and mathematics will be explored.
