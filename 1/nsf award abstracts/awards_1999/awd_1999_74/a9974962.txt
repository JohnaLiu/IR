	In
              this project, three-dimensional plasma equipment models (PEMs) are developed to
              investigate chemical, physical, and engineering scaling issues in
              plasma-processing reactors of industrial interest.  These models build upon an
              integrated hybrid simulation hierarchy in which PEMs are linked with
              plasma-surface interaction models.  New algorithms for 3-d electron and ion
              transport, sheath structure, and plasma-surface interactions are developed for
              investigation of transient plasma processes.  Moderately parallel (2-10
              processors) computers are employed so that transient or real-time linking of
              phenomena having disparate timescales can be addressed.  Reactors with rotating
              magnetic fields, such as magnetically enhanced reactive ion etching (MERIE) and
              ionized metal physical vapor deposition (IMPVD) reactors, wave-plasma phenomena
              in helicon reactors, and transients (startup, shutdown, recipe changes) in
              "conventional" reactors like inductively coupled plasma (ICP) reactors are
              investigated.  The objectives are to assess the impact of 3-d plasma transport
              on the uniformity and quality of the etch or deposition and to generate scaling
              laws to transfer these assessments to other systems
