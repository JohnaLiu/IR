Dr. Brown will study how the social environment affects levels of
              an animal's steroid hormones, and how these hormones may affect its immune
              response, in a colonial bird, the cliff swallow.  The objectives are to
              determine (1) if there is a relationship between group size and levels of the
              hormones testosterone and corticosterone; (2) how social interaction (stress)
              is related to hormone levels; (3) if there is a relationship between hormone
              levels and immune function; and (4) how parasites affect hormone levels and
              immune function.  Blood samples will be taken for hormone analysis and immune
              response tests done in the field on free-living individuals.  Behavioral
              interactions such as fighting will be observed.  Simple immunological tests
              will be performed to measure the birds' immune responses.  Hormone levels and
              immune responses of birds occupying nests in which blood- sucking ectoparasites
              have been removed will be compared to those of birds in naturally infested
              nests.
 
This study will be the first attempt to study how hormone levels
              influence the evolution of group living.  The results should lead to new
              insight into the poorly understood problem of why sociality evolves and why
              social groups vary in size.  This study will be the first to address how
              hormones affect immune ability under natural conditions. If there is a link,
              the results will have potentially far-reaching biomedical implications.
