Abstract    :
              Dr. Jack Norton of the Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              of the Chemistry Division to (i) examine the dynamics of hydride ligand
              exchange with hydrogens of uncoordinated acids; (ii) search for optically
              active hydride complexes and explore their ability to catalyze enantioselective
              hydrogenation of prochiral substrates; (iii) explore insertion reactions of
              nitrogen- and sulfur-containing cyclic reagents into the M-C bond of
              zirconaaziridines, and related systems, and exploit their dynamics and
              configurational changes to control the stereochemistry of amino acid
              derivatives; and (iv) examine the likelihood that electrophilic boranes used to
              activate olefin polymerization catalysts can also serve as one-electron
              oxidants.

The significance of the project is manyfold: (i) hydride acceptors
              from metal centers will be utilized to uncover important new methods for
              generating reactive cationic metal catalysts, and (ii) studies focussed at
              understanding the reduction and abstraction properties of fluorinated borane
              compounds will have a direct bearing on the development of new methods to
              produce polymers currently in daily production in several industrial
              facilities. Students and post-doctorate associates will receive excellent
              training in the area of catalysis and polymer precursor chemistry, the kind of
              training that will facilitate obtaining good industrial jobs.
