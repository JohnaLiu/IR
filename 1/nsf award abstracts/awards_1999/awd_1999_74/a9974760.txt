Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Northern Illinois University will
              acquire a powder X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in
              a number of areas including the following:  1) characterization of thin films
              of magneto-resistant materials; 2) structure-property relationships of
              nanograin colossal magnetoresistant films by deposition of aqueousacetate
              solution (DAAS) technique; 3) identification of powder samples and thin films
              of intermetallic materials; 4) chemical modification of layered intermetallic
              materials as quantum well structures; 5) carborane compounds; 6) synthesis and
              characterization of metallacarboranes; 7) design and synthesis of chiral
              diaryldiselenides; and 8) characterization and use as asymmetric catalysts in
              reduction of prochiral radicals. 

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate
              and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
              including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about
              the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. 
              This instrument will have an impact on the research of four groups in the areas
              of materials science and synthetic chemistry.  In addition, students will have
              hands-on access for research purposes and in the classroom setting.
