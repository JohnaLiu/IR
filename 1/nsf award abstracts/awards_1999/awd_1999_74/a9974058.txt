This is an award to support travel expenses for young
              investigators to attend the conference on "Trends in Condensed Matter Physics"
              to be held at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, from September 16-18,
              1999.  Topics to be covered include the quantum Hall effect; the
              metal-insulator transition in two-dimensions; mesoscopic physics of metals and
              semiconductors; high temperature superconductivity; and, spin
              glasses.
