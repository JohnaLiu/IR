Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Emory University will acquire an
              X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector. This equipment will enhance research
              studies in a number of areas including the following: 1) synthetic models of
              iron sites in biological systems; 2) crystal engineering as a model of
              biomineralization; 3) scaffold approach to enantiomerically-pure substituted
              heterocycles; 4) inorganic clusters and cluster derived materials for
              catalysis, medicine and environmentally benign processes; 5) complex organic
              ring systems; 6) studies of organic-nitrogen moieties as potential catalysts
              for denitrification of petroleum products; 7) atomic dispersion parameters
              analysis by variable temp X-ray diffraction; 8) synthetic organic chemistry of
              bioactive organic compounds; 9) cascade processes in synthetic organic
              chemistry; and 10) preparation of nanotubes using oligomers of substituted
              ethynlterpyridyl metal complexes.  

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate
              and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
              including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about
              the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring
              molecules.
