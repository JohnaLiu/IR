Project Summary

The All Taxa
              Biodiversity Inventory (ATBI) of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a
              cooperative project involving National Park Service personnel, scientists from
              at least 37 universities, and 17 private organizations. Its objectives are to
              collect, organize and disseminate information on the distribution, abundance
              and natural history of each of the 100,000 species estimated to inhabit the
              park. The outlines of an information system to support these objectives have
              been enunciated in the course of three preliminary planning meetings. This work
              focuses on the development and deployment of a prototype for this information
              system that leverages existing biodiversity information products. The primary
              data, consisting of specimens and observations of taxa, will be collected by
              ATBI participants using off-the-shelf database or spreadsheet software. For
              this first phase of the ATBI, these data will be downloaded, transformed, and
              input into a central relational database system. The database will provide
              access to the primary data for researchers and land managers. It will be
              designed to bring the data into compliance with Federal Geospatial Data
              Committee standards on biological data and be developed in conformance with the
              Integrated Taxonomic Information System and National Biological Information
              Infrastructure.
