Abstract    :
              Some animals have highly exaggerated features such as plumage or antlers that
              are believed to have evolved from of sexual selection mechanisms.  But some
              cases have further consequences for sensory processing, such as the extreme
              lateralization of eyes in hammerhead sharks, some crustaceans, and several
              insects.  One extreme example is found in the diopsid family of flies known as
              'stalk-eyed flies' where the eyes may be more than a body-length apart.  It
              remains unknown whether there is unusual neuroanatomy, physiology or behavioral
              capabilities of the visual system in these animals.  This project uses
              microscopy, electrophysiology and behavioral tests to compare the visual system
              of some stalk-eyed fly species to those of other insects and other arthropods,
              to see whether they have specific adaptations for binocular or even
              stereoscopic vision for distance estimation, and to see whether developing
              young flies require visual experience to use the eyes for distance
              perception.
   Results will have a broad impact because they will be important
              not only for invertebrate vision, but in comparison with other animal visual
              systems, and for understanding the development and evolution of visual
              behavior.  The project will provide excellent cross-disciplinary postdoctoral
              and undergraduate training.
