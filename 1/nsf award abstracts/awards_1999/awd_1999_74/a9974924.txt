Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
              Riverside will acquire an Absorption and Emission Spectrometer.  This equipment
              will enhance research in a number of areas, including optical spectroscopy at
              high pressure for studies of pressure induced changes in the optical spectra of
              organic solids and pressure tuned optical dynamics; the characterization of the
              chemical architecture of carbon-fiber surfaces; fluorescent tags for Schiff
              base-forming sites in proteins; absorption and fluorescence studies of
              metalloporphyrins with applications to molecular photonics design; synthesis of
              inherently fluorescent macrocycles for use as chemical sensors; and
              photophysics of polymeric squaraines.

An optical spectrometer is an
              essential part of a research active department.  For example, routine optical
              measurements can be used to identify reaction products, evaluate sample purity
              and/or degradation, photometrically determine concentrations, and measure
              optical properties of thin films and optical components.
