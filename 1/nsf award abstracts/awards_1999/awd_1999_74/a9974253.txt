Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics.  The research and training plan is in the area of integrated plant
              biology and is entitled, "Using DNA micro-arrays to search for patterns of gene
              expression in plants subject to environmental stress."

DNA micro-arrays
              allow the observation of gene expression patterns on a whole genome scale. 
              Micro-arrays are being used to collect expression data from Arabidopsis grown
              in elevated levels of carbon dioxide. This data are being statistically sorted
              and expression patterns identified by software developed for the project.  This
              software can then be applied to search for patterns caused by other
              environmental stresses.
