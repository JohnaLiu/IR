The purpose of the investigation is to explain the feasibility
              of using ultra-fast laser pulses with high energy amplified emission to
              generate hard, medically relevant doses of x-rays.  If shown to be feasible, it
              is anticipated that a time-gated x-ray technology could be developed for the
              imaging of phantoms that would greatly exceed the capability of conventional
              x-ray systems from the point of view of early detection, dosage level, and
              resolution.  Successful demonstration of this approach has many advantages and
              can be accomplished with today's laser technology:  resolution would be
              increased by an order of magnitude (lasers can be focused to ten microns
              diameter rather than tenths of a millimeter in today's X-ray tubes); an order
              of magnitude smaller source means that a one-tenth size smaller tumor or lesion
              could be found; scattering noise would be reduced by the time-gated detector
              thereby yielding a higher signal-to-noise ration (SNR) of the image by a factor
              of 5 or more.

The investigation and high risk investigation is designed to
              obtain fundamental knowledge needed to confirm the feasibility of the
              technology.  The eventual pay-off would be high in enhancing our ability to
              detect breast cancer at an earlier stage and with a lower dose.  This
              investigation is funded as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER).
