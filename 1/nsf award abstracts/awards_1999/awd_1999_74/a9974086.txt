Many plants occur in populations where one sex outnumbers
              the other.  Scarcity or absence of one sex will limit or prevent sexual
              reproduction, making populations more vulnerable to environmental change, and
              risking extinction.  Using a plant having gender frequencies that differ across
              populations, this research (1) assesses differences among individuals in sexual
              reproduction, clonal reproduction, and growth; (2) determines how these
              differences affect gender frequencies within and among populations; (3) begins
              a long-term field study monitoring gender frequencies; and (4) develops
              mathematical models to explain and predict natural patterns.  A combination of
              DNA fingerprinting, field and greenhouse experiments, and modeling analysis are
              used to achieve these goals.

Though many species feature both clonal and
              sexual reproduction, few studies have been able to distinguish their effects
              and those of growth on population dynamics over an entire life cycle.  This
              project addresses these effects and their implications using a representative
              of a large but understudied group of plants (bryophytes).  Thus, this research
              will contribute to the conservation of these plants and of other species
              capable of reproducing both clonally and sexually, while providing training to
              young researchers in a diversity of important and broadly useful research
              methods.
