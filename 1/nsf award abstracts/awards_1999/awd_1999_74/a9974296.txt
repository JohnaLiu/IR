This study will explore the
              influence of two important clonal attributes, clonal integration and ramet
              aggregation, on the outcome of interspecific interactions among clonal plants.
              It will develop a series of predictions about how these two characteristics
              influence both individual-level competitive ability and overall community
              structure. This will be done using a series of experiments using eight clonal
              species typical of calcareous peatland communities of southeastern Michigan. It
              is hoped that the work outlined in this proposal will integrate the currently
              disparate research areas of field studies of plant competition, clonal
              integration and foraging and theoretical studies of community-level
              consequences of spatial arrangement of individuals. This project will
              contribute to our knowledge of the ecology of clonal plants and to our
              understanding of how competition at the individual level is translated into
              species patterns at the community level.
