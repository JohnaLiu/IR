Abstract    :
              Modern IC's face many reliability problems and therefore online error detection
              mechanisms are necessary. Fault injection experiments are crucial in validating
              the correctness and in accessing the capability of these error handling or
              detecting designs. Prof. Lo is exploring the feasibility of using
              nanotechnology, specifically the nanofabrication of defects, in fault injection
              experiments. The faults are injected onto the silicon surfaces of commercial
              microprocessors/microcontrollers and FPGAs using the atomic force microscope
              (AFM)/scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with resolution down to hundreds of
              angstroms. The purpose is to create or at least emulate the effect of real-life
              run-time faults due to component aging, manufacture imperfections,
              electromigration and many others. Another goal of the project is to monitor the
              physical phenomena of the device under test. These include the power supply
              current level, thermal condition and electromagnetic activities. The proposed
              method is superior in that: (1) An accurate and repeatable fault injection
              experiment can be easily achieved; (2) The resolution of AFM/STM ranges from
              tens of micrometers to hundreds of angstroms; and (3) No radioactive material
              is involved
