This grant will support theoretical research in the electronic
              properties of mesoscopic structures.  Three primary focus areas will be
              emphasized: Coulomb blockade effects in quantum dots connected to external
              reservoirs by quantum dots, thermopower in coupled quantum dot systems, and
              spin-orbit interaction effects on the spin susceptibility of nanoparticles. 
              Perturbation theory, bosonization techniques, and other theoretical approaches
              will be used in this work, which is expected to explain current experiments on
              nanoscale structures as well as stimulate new experiments.  The theoretical
              findings can be tested using experiments on semiconductor heterostructures,
              metallic systems, and self-assembled structures.

The main objective of this
              research grant is to advance our understanding of the behavior of electrons in
              nanostructures.  The submicron scales of current electronic devices makes a
              theoretical understanding of such behavior technologically important for our
              overall understanding of new devices.  This work is expected to explain current
              experimental results, as well as stimulate new experiments on nanoscale devices
              and materials.  The theoretical findings of this work can be compared with
              experiments in semiconductor heterostructures, metallic systems, and
              self-assembled structures.
