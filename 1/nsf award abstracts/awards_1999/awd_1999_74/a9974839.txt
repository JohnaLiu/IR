Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in
              Madison will acquire an Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometer. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including studies in
              mechanistic organometallic chemistry; propargyl metal complexes; folding of
              proteins & protein-like molecules; design of enzyme inhibitors and
              peptidomimetrics; carbohydrate recognition; and the synthesis of complex
              organic molecules.  

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
              intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
              array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules.
