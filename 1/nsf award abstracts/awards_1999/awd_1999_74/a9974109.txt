Abstract    :
              This is a project that covers the costs of U.S. plenary speakers and key
              organizers for the international, multidisciplinary conference to be hosted by
              the organization Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM). The
              conference will be held at Oxford, July 18-28, 1999. Travel funding is also
              provided for junior researchers and for minority and women participants.
    
              
The mission of the conference is to establish a common agenda among
              computation, pure mathematics and computer science.
     
All FoCM
              conferences focus on a novel constellation of subjects in which the
              computational process itself and the foundational mathematical underpinnings
              are the objects of study.  The meetings are broad, encouraging interaction
              among subjects rarely brought together at other conferences.
