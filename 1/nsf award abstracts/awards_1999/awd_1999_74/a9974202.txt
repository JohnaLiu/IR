Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Research Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              population biology and is entitled "Bioinformatic analysis of the effects of
              genetic and spatial diversity on the survival and variability of host-symbiont
              systems."  Different degrees of genetic and spatial heterogeneity, in relation
              to interspecific selection and comigration, will affect the spatial and
              temporal distribution of host species and their symbionts.  This bioinformatic
              study analyzes how these dynamical processes increase, or decrease, the
              persistence of metapopulations and local populations of the two interacting
              species.
