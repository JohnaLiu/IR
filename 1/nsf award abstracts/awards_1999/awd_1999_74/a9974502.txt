Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa will
              purchase a parallel computer.  This equipment will enhance research in a
              variety of areas including a) modeling the active sites of proteins; b) studies
              of zirconocene-olefin complexes; c) metal-metal bonding in electron-poor
              dinuclear compounds; d) electronic structure calculations of weakly bound metal
              ion-molecule complexes; e) studies of the role of H-bonds in active site
              function of serine enzymes; and f) experimental and computational studies of
              charge transfer complexes.

A workstation network of fast, modern computer
              workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry
              departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development environment
              for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics and
              visualization facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art
              applications of parallel processing.
