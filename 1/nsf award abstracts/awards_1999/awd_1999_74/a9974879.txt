Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Mississippi to
              acquire a Differential Scanning and Isothermal Titration Calorimeter.   This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including thermodynamic
              studies of protein unfolding and energetics of protein-DNA interactions. 
              

Differential scanning calorimetry, differential thermal analysis and
              thermal gravimetric analysis are basic tools of materials chemistry and
              science.  They provide fundamental information on the thermal stability and
              characteristics of novel materials.
