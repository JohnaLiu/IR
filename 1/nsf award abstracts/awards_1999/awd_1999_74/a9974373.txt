Recent advances in synchrotrons, diamond anvil cell design
              and laser heating techniques have opened up a new window of opportunity for the
              study of minerals at high pressures and simultaneous high temperatures. Using
              laser heating of diamond anvil cell samples and synchrotron radiation, the
              thermal equations of state of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 in the perovskite structure,
              (Mg,Fe)O, SiO2, Fe, Ni and FeS will be measured under the pressure and
              temperature conditions of the lower mantle and outermost core.  These
              measurements will constrain the thermal expansion of these materials at high
              pressures and temperatures well above the Debye temperatures of the materials. 
              The temperature and pressure derivatives of the bulk modulus will also be
              determined at high pressures and temperatures. The above data will allow
              thermal equations of state of mantle and core materials to be constructed for
              use in comparing laboratory data with the seismically observed properties of
              the Earth's mantle and core.  This type of comparison will aid us in
              understanding the thermal structure of the Earth's mantle and core, the
              composition of the Earth's lower mantle, and whether or not the Earth's mantle
              is chemically layered.
