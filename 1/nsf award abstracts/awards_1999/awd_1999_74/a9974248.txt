Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Research Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 1999.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              eukaryotic genetics and is entitled "Gene splicing and altered genetic codes in
              hypotrichous ciliates."  This is a study of codon usage and base composition in
              hypotrichous ciliates --unicellular eukaryotes with altered nuclear genetic
              codes. The hypothesis being tested is that certain hypotrichs evolved to
              translate the "nonsense" that occurs where their genes are spliced together
              during development.   Software is being modified and developed for gene
              annotation in ciliate genome projects.
