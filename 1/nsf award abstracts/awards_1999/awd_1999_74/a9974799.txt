Abstract    :
              The plant mitochondrial genome has evolved several distinguishing features that
              influence its structure and expression.  One of these is the maintenance of
              subgenomic DNA molecules at markedly different copy numbers.  The phenomenon of
              genomic shifts in copy number and the retention of substoichiometric DNA
              molecules within the plant mitochondrial genome will be investigated using the
              cytoplasmic male sterility system in common bean.  This award will support two
              graduate students to complete their Ph.D. thesis research in two areas of this
              topic.  The first will investigate the physiological implications of genomic
              shifts in the mitochondrial genome by examining the effects of shifting on
              cross-compatibility, the influence of temperature on the shifting process, and
              the plant tissues in which the mitochondrial genome is protected from shifting.
               The second student will investigate the expression of the mitochondrial
              sterility sequence, pvs-orf239, and its influence on the shifting process. 
              This will include investigation of the export of the ORF239 product from the
              mitochondrion to the periphery of the cell; these particular studies will be
              carried out in yeast transformed with the pvs-orf239 sequence.

These
              investigations, through taking advantage of features special to the common bean
              system, address biological phenomena relevant to all higher plants, and should
              provide strategies for directed manipulation of the plant mitochondrial
              genotype.
