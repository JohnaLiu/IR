Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, Prof. Laurie Butler of the University of Chicago will design and
              construct a modular instrument to study the photofragmentation channels of
              polyatomic radicals.  The instrument will incorporate the following
              capabilities:  a) photolytic generation of radicals in a skimmed,
              differentially-pumped pulsed molecular beam expansion source; b)
              high-resolution velocity map imaging detection, with real-time ion-counting, of
              the velocities, internal state distributions, and angular distributions of
              reaction products detected via resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization; c)
              hydrogen atom high-n Rydberg time-of-flight detection; and d) dispersed UV
              photon emission detection.  

Gas phase radical chemistry is of central
              importance in diverse areas such as combustion and atmospheric processes.
