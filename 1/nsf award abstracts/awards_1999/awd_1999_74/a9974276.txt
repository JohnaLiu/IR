This award will partially support the
              Midwest Dynamical Systems Seminar.  This conference series has met twice yearly
              for 
over twenty-eight years.  Over the course of these years, the meetings
              have been held from University of Montana to the 
University of Texas, from
              Boston University to UC Berkeley, and at many place in between.  The Seminar
              has had significant 
impact on the community through the dissemination of
              recent results and the training of young investigators
