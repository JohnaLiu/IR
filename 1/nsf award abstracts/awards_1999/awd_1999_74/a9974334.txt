Abstract    :
              
This multi-disciplinary venture involves physical chemistry of excitable gels,
              electrophysiology of normal heart muscle, bioengineering, and applied
              mathematics with emphasis on high-performance computation.  It centers around
              the propagation of periodic activations from vortex lines in motionless
              3-dimensional excitable media.  In normal healthy heart muscle, such
              spontaneous and lethal periodicity can arise independently of any pathology,
              e.g., by electrical or mechanical shock.  This "ventricular fibrillation" and
              its physical mechanisms have features in common with all other excitable media,
              for example "cold flames" in a chemical gel that propagates waves of color in 3
              dimensions.  Much is also learned from numerical experiments on the
              3-dimensional partial differential equations of local reaction and diffusion
              that summarize both mechanisms (ionic channel dynamics and biolectric potential
              diffusion in one, chemical kinetics and molecular diffusion in the other.)  All
              three have been under study in Dr. Winfree's laboratory for some years; the
              exchange of insights and analogies between them has been fruitful for all three
              areas, as testified by the -240 citations of these results annually as
              components of published investigations by others in diverse fields.
