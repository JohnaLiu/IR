Next Generation Software:
               Active Debugging Information for Multi-Language, Multi-Platform
              Debugging

This project is aimed at developing debuggers that work seamlessly
              with multiple platforms and multiple languages, and to which one can add
              support for new platforms and new languages at low cost.

This proposal
              proposes a radical change from the way current compiler technology supports
              debugging. In essence the proposal proposes to develop active debuggers. 
              Instead of simply giving some compiler-generated information about the program,
              allow the debugger to step through the code itself.  The proposal has selected
              a set of operations that the debugger will perform to analyze the code, and
              such operations can be performed efficiently by invoking the compiler to
              provide implementation of the critical operations.  Given this approach allows
              the debugger to support applications including multilanguage modules.  
              

Some preliminary demonstration of some of these ideas has been already done
              by the proposer with encouraging indications, as to the effectiveness and
              efficiency of the proposed methods.
