Maternal environments may influence the expression of
              traits in their offspring. These maternal effects can alter evolutionary change
              in response to selection, creating lag times, negative or cyclical responses,
              or lack of change.  In addition, if genetically based, maternal environmental
              effects may themselves contribute to adaptive evolution. Despite theoretical
              and empirical results demonstrating the potential contribution of maternal
              effects to evolution, we know almost nothing about their prevalence in natural
              populations.  The proposed research addresses this gap in our knowledge.
              Previous work with Campanula americana, an herbaceous plant, suggests that
              maternal effects contribute to the maintenance of annual and biennial life
              histories.  Using a quantitative genetic approach, maternal genetic and
              environmental effects on life history will be evaluated.  By carrying this
              approach to two environments, the explicit contribution of maternal
              environmental effects to adaptive evolution will be quantified.
              

Investigating the interaction between maternal effects and response to
              selection will increase our understanding of multigenerational processes in
              evolution and the role of the environment in modifying evolutionary change.
              Understanding mechanisms of adaptive evolution is central for predicting
              response to environmental change.
