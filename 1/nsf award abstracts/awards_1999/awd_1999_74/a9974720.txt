Abstract    :
              This research program is part of an ongoing investigation at Treasure Island,
              California, to investigate the effect of blast loading on structures.  This
              particular project is investigating the difference between blast-induced and
              earthquake-induced liquefaction.  The goal is to learn more about
              earthquake-induced liquefaction, but since it is so difficult to obtain data
              during strong earthquake shaking, there continues to be a lot of interest in
              obtaining data from simulated earthquake conditions, namely via blast-induced
              liquefaction.  The question always is: how accurate is blast-induced
              liquefaction in simulating earthquake-induced liquefaction?  This is the
              objective of this study.

The primary seismic method employed is a
              crosshole-type measurement, but measurements are also made using the spectral
              analysis of surface waves (SSAW) technique.
