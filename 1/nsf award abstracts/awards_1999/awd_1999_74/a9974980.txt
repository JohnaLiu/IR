Title: Improving Hugs: Haskell as a Research
              Tool
PI's: Tim Sheard and Mark Jones, Oregon Graduate Institute

The
              programming language Haskell has emerged as the standard lazy
functional
              language, and offers strong typing, higher-order features, and
parametric
              polymorphism.  The Hugs interpreter is a simple, easily ported,
implementation
              of Haskell. This project will enhance Hugs, focusing on
issues of usability
              and integration with the high-performance Glasgow
Haskell Compiler.

The
              project improves the Hugs interpreter in several ways:

Integration with GHC
              runtime system:
By completing the integration of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
              run-time
system with the Hugs interpreter, a fully interoperable system
              capable
of executing a mixture of compiled and byte-code interpreted code
              will
be constucted.
  
Declarative debugging: 
The project will investigate
              the problem of tracing the computational steps
of a lazy functional program,
              at a level of abstraction consistent with the
programmers view of the
              program.


Better Error Reporting:
The project investigates how to improve
              the type error debugging
process by building improved type inference systems
              into
Hugs, capable of reporting both where and why type errors
              have
occurred.
 
Successful integration with the GHC run-time system has
              numerous
benefits. It allows the Hugs interpreter to access the existing
              GHC
features including compiled preludes and libraries, while maintaining
the
              small footprint and ease of use of an interpreter. Completion of
the project
              will greatly increase the size and complexity of the
problems to which the
              Hugs interpreter can be applied.
