Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
              Irvine will purchase computer graphics workstations and a fast server. This
              equipment will enhance research in  a variety of areas including 1) quantum
              simulations of spectroscopy and the determination of accurate interactions for
              large polyatomic systems; 2) development of new methods to process
              multi-dimensional NMR spectra; 3) prediction of reaction stereochemistry; 4)
              modeling of the pi-facial selectivity of the type 2 intramolecular Diels-Alder
              reaction; 5) molecular dynamics simulation studies of the temperature,
              hydration and environmental dependence of protein dynamics; 6) aromatic
              reactivity in chemistry & biology: ditryptophan crosslinking; 7) mechanism of
              indole and related dimerization reactions; 8) Thia-Sommelet sigmatropic
              dearomatization; 9) prediction and elucidation of stereochemistry:
              stereoselectivity of 5-membered oxonium ion reactions; and 10) organosilicon
              isomerization.

A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations
              is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a
              "computer network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical
              codes and algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics and visualization
              facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel
              processing.
