Abstract    :
              Although molecular models have played a crucial role in research and teaching
              for over 100 years, today these models primarily are generated by computer
              graphics displays that are powerful in some respects but lacking in others.  In
              order to bring balance to this situation, a computer program (SCULPT) has been
              written to create solid models of selected regions of macromolecules by using
              atomic coordinates from the Protein Data Bank.  These model are constructed in
              wax, wood, or other materials to a scale corresponding to commercially
              available atomic models.  This utilizes a dedicated computer numeric controlled
              (CNC) milling machine capable of machining wood (10,000rmp spindle speed) and
              large enough to build a model of most typical macromolecular binding or
              receptor sites.  An educational consultant assists with the preparation of
              study guides and classroom materials for teaching high school advanced
              placement biology and chemistry students.  The P.I. is actively involved in
              undergraduate and graduate teaching of biochemistry students.  Research
              applications are derived from his laboratory and from collaborations with other
              groups.
