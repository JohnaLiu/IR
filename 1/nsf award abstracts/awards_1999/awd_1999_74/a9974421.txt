Abstract    :
              Public Perception of Y2K Risks

ABSTRACT

As the world approaches the change
              of the millennium, intense public interest has become focused on the possible
              consequences of potential failures in computer technologies. These potential
              failures arise because the mechanism for storing and calculating dates does not
              adequately differentiate between the turn of the previous century (i.e., 1900)
              and the turn of the millennium (i.e., 2000 or "Y2K"). Though technical experts
              generally predict that problems are likely to be either non-existent or minor,
              they cannot conclude with certainty that no problems will occur.  Thus, the
              broad public, exposed to an array of press reports concerning Y2K and its
              possible consequences for their lives, can only conclude that the problem is
              not completely understood and that certain solutions have not been achieved. 
              

Research on perception of Y2K risks will extend our understanding of how
              public risk perceptions are formed in real-world, complex social situations,
              and will improve our ability to predict how social, psychological and cultural
              factors influence society's responses to risk. Over the course of 1999, a
              series of focused survey studies will gather data on public perceptions of Y2K
              risks based on current research on risk perception, communication and risk
              management. The Y2K event poses a unique opportunity to examine how perceptions
              of risk evolve in response to social processes and to advance current theories
              of risk perception to take greater account of how risk perceptions are formed
              over time and in response to a changing information environment.
