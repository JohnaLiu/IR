This project addresses the topics of liquid crystal gel systems,
              and symmetry and textures in thin films of smectic liquid crystals.  In the
              area of liquid crystal gels, experiments will be carried out to explore the
              coupling of the gel network to the nematic liquid crystal, which imparts unique
              properties to this system.  
Electro-optical microscopy experiments will be
              performed, including studies of the symmetry of the sample response, and the
              formation of domain walls, as a function of applied voltage and sample
              thickness.  Macroscopic and microscopic mechanical experiments will be
              performed to observe directly the gel-nematic coupling, and gel microspheres
              will be explored as a useful experimental geometry.  Thin smectic films will be
              studied, comparing free standing films with polar films on the surface of a
              liquid, with special attention to the changes in texture resulting from the
              change in symmetry of the film.  Computations will be carried out to try to
              account for the observed textures, in terms of models for the free energy of
              these systems.  Experimental methods include polarized light video microscopy,
              and manipulation of the sample texture with electric fields and optical
              tweezers, which are highly focused laser beams.

Fundamental studies of the
              structural and molecular properties of electro-optic effects in nematic gels
              and the symmetry and textures in thin smectic films is relevant to
              understanding and optimizing the static and dynamic behavior of liquid crystals
              in flat panel display devices.  The broader educational impact of this kind of
              research involving physics, chemistry and biology provides an excellent
              training ground for students from high school through post-doctoral training.
