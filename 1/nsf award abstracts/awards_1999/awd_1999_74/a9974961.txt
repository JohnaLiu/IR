The objective of this research is to investigate
              the molecular basis for oxidation-reduction, ligand selection, and ligand
              stabilization processes of hemoglobin (HbI) isolated from Lucina pectinata. 
              This hemoglobin is probably the only heme protein that carries out its
              function, to transport H2S to a bacteria symbion, in a hydrogen-sulfide bound
              ferric state.  The presence of H-bonding between the heme-Fe+3 SH2 moiety and
              the Gln(E7) group is postulated to stabilize the HbISH2 center.  Likewise,
              other amino groups, in particular, Gln(E7),  Phe(B10), and Phe(E11)  may
              interact with other HbI ligands, CO and O2.   In order to understand the
              structural and functional characteristics of this enzyme, site-directed mutants
               of HbI will be used to  determine its association and dissociation constants
              with different ligands as a function of pH.  These studies in conjunction with
              the FTIR and resonance Raman work should produce new insight about factors that
              control H2S binding, transport, and delivery. 

The goal of this research is
              to study the ligand affinity differences in heme proteins.  At present, it is
              not established whether these differences arise from electrostatic effects,
              from steric constraints, or from hydrogen-bonding differences.  It is hoped
              that the these studies with hemoglobin I from Lucina pectinata will resolve
              some of these issues and produce new insight about the structural and
              functional characteristics of this unusual hemoglobin.  The work is likely to
              produce information that may be useful in the design of  recombinant HbI
              proteins with commercial uses, for example, as a specific H2S biosensor.  These
              proteins may also be used for the removal of toxic H2S from industrial or
              natural processes, such as anaerobic fermentation, sewage, and natural gas
              production.
