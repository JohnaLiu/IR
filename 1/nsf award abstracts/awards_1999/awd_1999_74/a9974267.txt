	The Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at the
              University of Cincinnati on October 22 and 23, 1999.  This colloquium series
              has become an important regional meeting.  It attracts participants primarily
              from the greater Midwest probability community.  It has a strong tradition of
              encouraging graduate students and other young investigators to attend and
              interact with specialists.
