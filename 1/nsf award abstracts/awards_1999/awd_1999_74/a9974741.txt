Abstract    :
              Tissue and organ homeostasis in all multicellular organisms is maintained by a
              rigid balance between cellular proliferation and cell death.  One of the most
              important mechanisms of cell death is a genetically regulated process of
              cellular suicide known as apoptosis.  Several forms of this process have been
              shown to involve (a) the apoptotic suppressor, Bcl-2, (b) a factor, Bid, which
              when activated induces cytochrome c efflux from mitochondria, and (c) several
              specific proteases, including caspase-3 and caspase-8.  The overall purpose of
              this project is to elucidate the molecular and biochemical roles of these gene
              products in the model system of apoptosis induced by staurosporine in human
              HL-60 cultured cells.  Experiments will be undertaken to answer three specific
              questions. (1) What is the staurosporine-activated caspase that processes Bid? 
              The caspase will be purified biochemically.  If novel, it will be sequenced,
              and its gene will be cloned.  (2) How does Bcl-2 regulate staurosporine-induced
              caspase-8 activation?  Several possibilities will be considered including the
              formation of signaling complexes with other components. (2) Does Bcl-2 form
              heterodimers with Bid in the cytosol and affect the susceptibility of Bid to
              caspase action?  The possible formation of such dimers and their substrate
              activities will be assayed directly.  It is expected that the results will
              yield fundamental new information about apoptosis applicable to a wide variety
              of multicellular organisms.
