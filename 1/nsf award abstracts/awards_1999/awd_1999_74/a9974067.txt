This LTREB project will continue to investigate a forest that
              has been influenced by repeated gypsy moth outbreaks. The gypsy moth is a
              classic example of an irruptive forest pest, and is a major economic problem in
              the eastern US where it periodically defoliates millions of hectares of
              deciduous forest. Factors that contribute to this kind of population dynamic
              remain unknown, and comprise a central focus of both population biology and
              pest control efforts. Previous work has identified the ability of the gypsy
              moth to induce changes in tree leaf chemistry, and the inhibitory impact of
              those changes on a virus that can influence gypsy moth population growth, as
              likely important mechanisms determining gypsy moth population cycles. In this
              LTREB project, two long-term hypotheses will be tested: (1) Gypsy moth-induced
              changes in oak leaf chemistry during incipient outbreak increases caterpillar
              resistance to a baculovirus, promoting gypsy moth population growth, and (2)
              gypsy moth defoliation has direct and indirect impacts on a range of coexisting
              herbivores in its community. Results thus far indicate that gypsy moth numbers
              are increasing as expected for an impending outbreak, and that defoliation and
              leaf chemistry are changing in concert. Experimental studies linked to the core
              long-term monitoring suggest some of the mechanisms involved in tree changes
              and link these to moth population dynamics. This study will provide valuable
              understanding of the dynamics of gypsy moth, and how the host plant and
              associated herbivores respond to periodic outbreaks of an economically
              important pest species.
