Abstract    :
              This award renews partial support for a collection of protozoa and
              photosynthetic protists at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).  The
              collection totals 1840 strains of protista representing 506 species and 214
              genera.  Of these, roughly 170 strains are photosynthetic (algae).  Of the 1660
              strains of protoza, 70% are free-living, and the remainder parasitic.  The
              number of genera represented in the collection has increased by over 30% since
              1994.   Of 315 strains accessioned since July 1994, 219 were acquired with NSF
              support.  NSF support is provided to support acquisition and distribution of
              strains that are not of biomedical interest.  A majority of the genera, both
              protozoan and algal, are not represented in any other public collection. 
              Samples of the collection are available at a modest fee.
