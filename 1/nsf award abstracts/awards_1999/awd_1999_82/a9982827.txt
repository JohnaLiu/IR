Abstract    :
              Although more than 95% of all animal species are invertebrates, there has been
              little systematic study of their intelligence.  To begin to remedy that
              deficiency has been the goal of this research with the honeybee, a highly
              evolved invertebrate of considerable economic importance. The experiments are
              done with free-flying subjects that come to the laboratory to work for a sugar
              solution and with restrained subjects that signal their anticipation of reward
              by extension of the proboscis.  The tasks set for the honeybees are much the
              same as those designed for the study of learning in fishes, birds, and mammals,
              and their performance in those tasks -- despite the remoteness of the
              evolutionary relationship and the marked contrast in brain size and structure
              -- also is much the same.

The results support the early speculation in the
              vertebrate literature that at the root of intelligence
Is a set of relatively
              simple associative mechanisms common to all but the most primitive animals?  As
              tasks of increasing complexity are set for the honeybees, it is to be expected
              that the absence of more advanced vertebrate capabilities will be evidenced by
              differences in their performance -- differences that should further our
              understanding of both the shared and the advanced capabilities.
