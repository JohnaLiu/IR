Abstract    :
              Paul Kleiber of the University of Iowa is funded by the Experimental Physical
              Chemistry Program to continue his spectral studies of the photodissociation of
              weakly bonded metal (calcium, zinc, aluminum, boron, etc.) complexes with
              hydrogen, small alkanes and aldehyde hydrocarbons .  The project will also
              extend the work to more risky studies, including those of the metal superoxides
              of calcium and iron.  This will yield product branching between reactive and
              quenching pathways, translational energy partition and vector anisotropy.  
              Fundamental information will be obtained on bonding and bond strengths,
              structures, nuclear motion dynamics, electronic nonadiabatic interactions and
              steric hindrance effects.  The experiments will be performed using a supersonic
              expansion molecular beam apparatus with reflectron, time of flight, mass
              spectrometry and laser photodissociation.

The studies will show how weakly
              bonded clusters molecules break up after they have been exposed to laser light.
               This provides information on the reaction pathways, on the structure of the
              complex and on the strengths of the bonds.  As well as the fundamental chemical
              interest, the work has applications to  atmospheric, biological and catalytic
              situations.
