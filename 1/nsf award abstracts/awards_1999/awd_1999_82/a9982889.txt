Abstract    :
              RE:  Lay abstract	Proposal IBN-9982889

This is a study to determine if two
              different regions of the brain, each of which have been separately implicated
              in memory function, actually work with each other to subserve certain aspects
              of memory.  Work in humans from imaging studies suggest this possibility, but
              the only way to assess this with any degree of confidence, and to have the
              ability to understand the nature of the relationship, is to perform an
              experiment in an animal model.  In this case, the rhesus monkey, which has a
              brain that is structured in a very similar manner to that of humans, is the
              species of choice.  Monkeys will undergo selective damage to these two parts of
              the brain, one in the temporal lobe, and the other in the frontal lobe.  For
              each structure, the damage will be made on one side of the brain, leaving the
              other side intact.  We will then "disconnect" the two remaining structures to
              see if this produces a change in how the animals learn and remember.  If a
              significant change occurs, we will have obtained initial evidence in
              determining that the two different structures participate together in learning
              and memory function.  This study could have important implications in the
              assessment of memory function in certain disease states and could have eventual
              bearing on memory rehabilitation efforts.
