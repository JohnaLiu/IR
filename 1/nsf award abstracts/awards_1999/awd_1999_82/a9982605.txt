Lay Summary


Many drugs have been shown to enhance the cognitive
              processes that underlie learning and memory in laboratory animals and humans. 
              Among the substances that have been implicated as memory modulators, several
              produce their beneficial effect by increasing glucose uptake and utilization in
              brain.  Glucose is the major source of fuel for brain and acts as a substrate
              for the synthesis of several neurotransmitters.  
Epinephrine (EPI) is a vital
              component in the theory most often advanced in explaining how
              peripherally-acting memory modulators affect memory.  According to one view,
              cognitive enhancing drugs act directly or indirectly upon the adrenal glands,
              which release EPI.  Although EPI is peripherally acting and does not cross the
              blood-brain barrier, the release of EPI results in the subsequent release of
              glucose from liver.  Increased amounts of glucose may enter brain and affect
              the neural systems underlying learning and memory.  
There is evidence,
              however, that some peripherally-acting cognitive enhancers act via a mechanism
              independent of glucose.  One such substance is L-glucose.  L-glucose is a
              peripherally acting glucose analog that does not cause an increase in
              blood-glucose levels.  Furthermore, L-glucose enhances memory in rodents when
              injected peripherally but not when injected directly in brain.  The experiments
              outlined in this proposal provide evidence of a mechanism that may be utilized
              by peripheral memory enhancer, L-glucose.  The hypothesis is that L-glucose
              utilizes direct neural connections (liver to brain via the vagus nerve) as a
              way to affect the CNS and memory storage processes.
