Abstract    :
              Jack Simons of the University of Utah is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to explore the quantum chemistry and dynamics
              of molecular anionic species.  His research focuses on (1) destabilization in
              dianions containing distinct electron binding sites, (2) Rydberg valence bound
              species, (3) the energetics of electron photodetachment from dianions, and (4)
              the dynamics of vibration/rotation-to-electronic energy flow leading to
              photodetachment.  Extensive collaboration with experimental efforts is a key
              feature of this research program.

The tools of theoretical chemistry are
              used to study unusual species which exhibit novel bonding situations and/or
              unusual physical phenomena.  Consequently it is often possible to predict new
              species whose existence depends on new bonding paradigms, fulfilling
              chemistry's central mission as science of synthesis.  In addition, the
              interpretation of laboratory findings is more and more frequently dependent on
              the tools of theoretical chemistry due to the complexity of the molecular
              systems under study.
