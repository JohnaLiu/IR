Abstract    :
              This project will initiate collaboration between ELDA/ELRA and LDC that includes
              networking and cross-agreements between the two organizations for the
              production, acquisition, normalization, certification and distribution of novel
              language data resources for research, education and technology development.   
              A reciprocity agreement to be negotiated between LDC and ELRA will take into
              account both European and American constraints on the distribution of data.  
              The parties will implement the legal agreement in a concrete manner through the
              production of a large-scale broadcast news corpus encompassing data in over 45
              languages, where the legal, technical, and distribution issues will be sorted
              out in accordance with the cross-agreement.  The production process will be
              conducted in accordance with best practices in this area as defined by ELRA's
              and LDC's previous work, and in particular will take advantage of LDC's
              previous experience in the collection of single language broadcast news
              collections and Internet-based distribution of language resources.   The joint
              undertaking will provide a concrete test case for transatlantic cooperation
              between the two organizations while simultaneously developing a unique resource
              to facilitate the other projects sponsored under this joint EC/NSF initiative.
