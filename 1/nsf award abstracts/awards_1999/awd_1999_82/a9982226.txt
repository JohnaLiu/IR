Abstract    :
              This project will extend the state of the art in high performance multilingual
              information access, both in terms of underlying science and its technological
              realization via a functional prototype for English and German in the biomedical
              domain. Heretofore, Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) was founded upon
              dictionary-based query translation methods or corpus-based statistical learning
              of vocabulary mappings, combined with various IR methods. The existence of
              large, well accepted ontological resources in biomedicine (e.g., MeSH and UMLS)
              enables a new interlingual approach wherein both queries and documents are
              mapped into multiple taxonomic categories automatically, permitting direct
              conceptual matching. This research will compare existing techniques
              (dictionarybased and corpus-based) with the new interlingual methods on various
              evaluative dimensions, such as I I-point average precision, computational
              tractability, and end-to-end user acceptability. To judge the latter, a full
              prototype system will be developed; that is the main focus of the European side
              of the project. In addition to developing and evaluating these new CLIR
              methods, and producing and evaluating a usable prototype application, this
              project will provide other benefits beyond CLIR proper improving IR precision
              via automated corpus-based word sense disambiguation; developing statistical
              methods for the creation of multilingual lexical and phrasal resources;
              providing automated on-demand summarization of retrieved documents using the
              Maximal Marginal Relevance method; and improving multilingual information
              access and management systems forthe biomedical domain.
