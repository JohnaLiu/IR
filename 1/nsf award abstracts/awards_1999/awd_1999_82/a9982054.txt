Digital Government:
               Identifying Where Technology Logging and Monitoring for Increased Security
              Ends and Where Violations of Personal Privacy and Student Records
              Begins

This award will examine issues related to the tension between 1) the
              progressively complex stages of computer access logging/monitoring resulting
              from the need for more aggressive security, and 2) conditions under which that
              logging, storage and possible release of information would constitute a
              violation of student record privacy.  The resulting study and identification of
              best practices will be provided to law enforcement agencies, data managers,
              policy experts, and developers of future privacy and security
              technologies.

The domain of interest is university student records, though
              the findings should extrapolate to other domains.  Collaborators will include
              the US Department of Education, Educause and the American Association of
              Collegiate Registrants and Admissions Officers.
