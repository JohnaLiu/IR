Abstract    :
              Kenneth Lipkowitz of Indiana U.-Purdue U. is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to study enantiomeric selectivity for molecules
              such as those employed in chiral chromatography.   Specifically, this research
              will examine the hypothesis that maximum chiral discrimination takes place when
              the binding site or chemical reactivity center is spatially coincident with the
              molecule's region of greatest enantiodifferentiation.  A theoretical approach
              is used wherein regions of maximum stereoselection or stereoinduction will be
              calculated and then compared to computed binding sites and/or to experimentally
              determined recognition sites.   A second, related goal of this project is to
              examine the relationship between chirality and enantiodiscrimination.

While
              chirality must exist as a precondition for stereoisomer-specific reaction
              chemistry, the relationship between how chiral a molecule is and its ability to
              induce an effect in a stereoselective manner is less well understood.  This
              project will make that connection, and aid separations scientists in designing
              stationary phases for chromatography and synthetic chemists in making better
              chiral catalysts.  The relationship between chirality and enantioselection will
              be firmly established, which has far reaching influences in all areas of
              science and technology, including medicine, materials, and related endeavors
              where chiral recognition is important.
