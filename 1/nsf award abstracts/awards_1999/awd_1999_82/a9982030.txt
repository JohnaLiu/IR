Abstract    :
              The STEPS project (Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study),
              planned for the early summer of 2000 in western Kansas, includes a network of
              three 10-cm wavelength Doppler radars: CHILL, S-Pol, and the Goodland, Kansas,
              WSR-88D.  The first two are also equipped for polarimetric measurements.  The
              polarimetric data enable estimation of hydrometeor types (snow, hail, rain)
              within thunderstorms and the Doppler data may be analyzed to give the airflow. 
              This project contributes to STEPS by providing gridded data sets of wind
              vectors and polarization parameters for STEPS investigators.  With colleagues
              J.C. Hubbert and L.J. Miller, the Principal Investigator will use the
              Doppler-observed airflow to calculate the growth of precipitation particles as
              they are swept through the storm.  Results will be compared with radar and
              aircraft observations to achieve a consistent picture of the relation between
              thunderstorm kinematics and precipitation.  The work also contributes to the
              validation of polarimetric radar data interpretation.
