Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed reserch is to develop a new class of data analysis
              methods.  This will involve on-the-fly identification of physically-important
              events selectively store the data.  This database will then be interrogated by
              feature extraction algorithms to yield an additional object database, which is
              a compact representation of the physically important space-time object
              trajectories.  These database objects will be used as input to novel data
              mining methods to discover causal relationships between the objects.  This
              approach will result in efficient storage of data, visualization of the
              important events within the data set, and methods for the high-level analysis
              of relationships between objects in the data.
