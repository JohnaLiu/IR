Abstract    :
              This research will explore which high-level information the architecture can use
              and the compiler can provide to exploit, predict, and react to program
              behavior. The compiler will give the architecture control- and data-dependence
              information in aggregate forms or using new high-level instructions and the
              architecture will further augment this information with run-time information to
              improve perfor-mance. To exploit this information, this research will also
              explore new architectural functionality, flexibility, caching policies,
              etc.

This research will also explore using symbolic data volumes and reuse
              distances parameter-ized with run-time values, and the architecture will decide
              the policies; how much and which data to prefetch, stream, or cache and with
              which replacement policies. This investigation will use the Scale compilation
              system to produce program "road maps," and will use simulation to explore
              advanced architecture features that employ navigation of the maps. The benefit
              of this research will be to sig-nificantly improve scientific and next
              generation software performance through a synergy of compiler information and
              new architectural mechanisms.
