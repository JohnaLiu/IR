Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop strategies for controlling the dynamics
              of cardiac muscle using occasional, small perturbations.  A simple test-bed,
              consisting of a small piece of periodically-paced bullfrog ventricle
              myocardium, is used in the work.  The first phase of the program will be
              devoted to determining the dynamics of the rapidly-paced tissue.  Experimental
              observations on the steady-state and restitution properties of the tissue, as
              well as the response of the tissue to extra electrical stimuli, will be
              compared to the predictions of an ionic-based mathematical model of the
              rapidly-paced tissue.  The second phase of the program involves developing
              methods for stabilizing (destabilizing) the unstable (stable) states of the
              periodically-paced muscle and applying them to the test-bed.  This award is
              jointly funded by the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences Directorate and the Biomedical Engineering and Research to Aid Persons
              with Disabilities Program in the Directorate for Engineering.
