The developmental program of an organism is encoded in the
              genome along with the end-product proteins of the differentiated cell types
              that make up the organism.  The highly automated procedures of molecular
              biology permit one to ask questions of a more global nature instead of focusing
              on individual gene products and activities. In this project, a novel approach
              to the investigation of sea urchin development is made possible by the advances
              that ensue from the sea urchin genome project. There are now at hand research
              materials that include a genomic sequence data base; the complete genomic
              sequence for the entire Hox gene complex; and a broad set of embryonic, larval
              and adult cDNA libraries.  With these resources,Dr. Cameron will begin to
              analyze at a genomic scale the genetic regulatory network of development.  Dr.
              Cameron proposes to analyze the general genomic organization of the Hox
              cluster, a highly conserved group of genes that are involved in patterning
              structures along the body axis of bilateral animals.   Dr. Cameron will use sea
              urchin embryonic gene transfer techniques to study the way that the expression
              of Hox genes are expressed in embryos.  Dr. Cameron will compare the genes
              expressed in the embryo with those expressed in the larvae, including those of
              the rudiment of the adult body which develops in the larva. Lastly Dr. Cameron
              will automate the techniques of whole mount in situ hybridization  to mRNA in
              order to classify all the different expression patterns that comprise embryonic
              development.
