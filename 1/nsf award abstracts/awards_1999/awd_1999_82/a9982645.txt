Diadenosine 5',5'''-P1, Pn-oligophosphates
              [A(5')pn(5')A], generally designated as ApnA (n = 2-6), in one or more form are
              present in all organisms examined including humans. ApnAs participate in a
              number of biological processes and are potential signaling nucleotides with
              both intracellular and extracellular functions. ApnAs are degraded by specific
              enzymes that potentially impact a number of cellular functions. In humans a
              gene designated FHIT encodes a putative tumor suppressor, Fhit.  Fhit is also
              an Ap3A hydrolase and a histidine triad (HIT) motif protein. In the fission
              yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a gene designated aps1 encodes Aps1 that
              catalyzes the degradation of ApnA (n = 4-6) with Ap6A and Ap5A as preferred
              substrates. Aps1 also catalyzes the  degradation of diphosphoinositol
              polyphosphates (PPInsP5 and [PP]2 InsP4 ). Aps1 is a mutT sequence motif
              protein, and it is unique among ApnA hydrolases with respect to its substrates
              and reaction products.  The first major goal of this project is to determine
              structural elements of human Fhit Ap3A hydrolase that are necessary for tumor
              suppression and for enzyme activity based on its known X-ray crystallographic
              structure. The second major goal is to determine the three dimensional
              structure of S. pombe Ap6A hydrolase and to determine the amino acid residues
              required for binding and hydrolysis of substrates by Aps1. The significance of
              accomplishing the first major goal will be: increased understanding of the
              mechanism of tumor suppression by a gene (FHIT) that is mutated in many common
              tumors. The significance of accomplishing the second major goal will be
              increased knowledge of the structure and mechanism of an  enzyme (Aps1)
              involved in modulating the effects of two classes of cellular signaling
              molecules (diadenosine oligophosphates and diphosphoinositol polyphosphates).
              The project will also contribute to the research education of graduate and
              professional students.
