The plant vascular system is composed of specialized cells
              that function to transport water and sugars.  These specialized cells are
              organized together into veins, and the veins interconnect all parts of the
              plant. The transport functions of  vascular tissue are vital to plant survival,
              and the patterning of these tissues is believed to provide limits to plant
              growth.  Despite the critical functions provided by vascular tissue, almost
              nothing is known about the genetic and molecular mechanisms that control vein
              pattern.

Genes that function in leaf vein pattern in Arabidopsis have
              already been identified by EMS-induced mutations.  Homozygous plants bearing
              these mutations show a variety of vein patterns defects, including vascular
              discontinuities, losses of veins, disorganized veins, and excess numbers of
              veins.

Five leaf vein pattern mutants will be characterized phenotypically,
              genetically, and molecularly.  Phenotypic studies will reveal whether other
              developmental defects accompany the vein pattern defects and whether auxin
              mediated processes are disrupted.  Genetic studies will include
              characterization of double mutants to assess whether the leaf development or
              hormone mutants.  Molecular characterization will focus on identification of
              the affected genes.
