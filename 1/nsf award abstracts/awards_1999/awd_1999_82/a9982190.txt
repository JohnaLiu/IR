Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will enable the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry  at the
              University of Maryland in College Park to purchase instrumentation for a
              vibrational sum frequency spectrometer.  This equipment will be used primarily
              by junior faculty member Robert A. Walker, whose research focuses on solvation
              dynamics at solid:liquid and liquid:liquid interfaces using ultrafast,
              nonlinear optical methods.  

Surface specific vibrational sum frequency
              generation has emerged as an invaluable technique for investigating molecular
              structure and composition at all types of interfaces.  This technique's
              popularity stems from its ability to provide detailed information about
              molecular conformation based on band positions and intensities.  These studies
              will extend our understanding of solvent motion and relaxation at condensed
              phase surfaces.
