Abstract    :
              Ethylene has been known since the beginning of the century to be used by plants
              as a signaling molecule for regulating a variety of developmental processes and
              stress responses, including seed germination, leaf and flower senescence, fruit
              ripening, cell elongation, nodulation and wound and pathogen responses.  In the
              last few years, it has become evident that the diversity and specificity of the
              ethylene responses are reflected in the complexity of its biosynthesis and
              perception.  The enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic(ACC) synthase converts
              S-adenosylmethionine to ACC, the precursor of ethylene, and
              methylthioadenosine.  The specific aims of this proposal are to initiate and
              study the biochemical characterization of the Arabidopsis ACC polypeptides and
              characterize their expression patterns by RNA hybridization analysis or
              microarray technology.

Ethylene is a unique plant signaling molecule.  Its
              synthesis is regulated by a diverse array of inducers.  Clearly
              characterization of the polypeptides involved in that synthesis will have both
              fundamental and practical importance.
