Abstract    :
              
Cells must sense their metabolic status as a barometer of their nutritional
              environment and use that information to alter their physiological programming.
              A prime example is the metabolic switch associated with the production and
              utilization of acetate undergone by cells of the bacterium Escherichia coli as
              they transit from exponential growth to stationary phase. During growth on
              certain sugars and amino acids, E. coli cells produce and excrete acetate. 
              Once they exhaust these nutrients, they undergo a metabolic switch: instead of
              excreting acetate, they utilize it. This switch occurs because cells induce
              production of an enzyme called acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs). This enzyme
              converts the previously excreted acetate to acetyl-CoA, the fundamental source
              of energy and the primary building block for constructing cellular components.
              The control of Acs production depends primarily on interactions between a
              complex biological machine called RNA polymerase and sequences of DNA located
              in front of the gene that encodes Acs. These interactions appear to be
              unusually elaborate. By exploring the dynamics of these interactions, this
              project will help us to learn how cells regulate the production of enzymes such
              as Acs that control critical metabolic checkpoints.
