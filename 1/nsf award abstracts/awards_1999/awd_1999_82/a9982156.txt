Abstract    :
              Gustavo Scuseria of Rice University is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to continue his development and application of
              quantum chemical computational tools.  He will implement (1) linear-scaling
              density functional methods for very large molecules, (2) exchange-correlation
              functionals for higher-accuracy calculations, and (3) linear-scaling
              pertubation and coupled-cluster theories in the atomic orbital basis.  He will
              apply these techniques to the study of fullerene and carbon nanotube problems
              of practical relevance.

Electronic structure methods are important
              computational tools in the prediction of chemical properties and the
              interpretation of experimental phenomena.  Until recently, highly accurate
              calculations have been limited to small molecules because of the steep scaling
              of the computation with molecular size.  Fast, linear-scaling methods are
              needed to overcome this bottleneck, since there is an extensive number of
              chemical problems involving large molecules requiring high-accuracy predictions
              of bond-breaking, electronic excitation, structure, and detailed reaction
              energetics.
