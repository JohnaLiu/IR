Many organisms have developed DNA repair mechanisms
              based on photo-induced ultrafast electron transfer from a flavoprotein, called
              DNA photolyase, to the tightly bound cyclobutylpyrimidine dimer (CPD) lesion.  
              The objective of this research is to elucidate the detailed kinetics and
              dynamics of the electron transfer and dimer splitting reactions of the
              photolyase-CPD complex, using near-UV/UV femtosecond absorption spectroscopy.
              An analysis of these experiments will show whether the CPD is repaired by a
              concerted or sequential mechanism and what intermediates are involved.
              Flavin-DNA model systems will be synthesized to isolate and highlight various
              kinetic details of the enzymatic reaction, including the role of the protein in
              the repair. Fluorescent labeling technology will be used to gain real-time
              information on the structural changes that accompany the CPD splitting
              reaction.

Ultraviolet radiation is capable of crosslinking adjacent nucleic
              acid bases in DNA, leading to mutation and cell death. The most common and
              lethal DNA photo-lesion is the cyclobutylpyrimidine dimer (CPD). In response to
              these lesions many organisms use flavoproteins to repair the damaged DNA. These
              proteins are called photolyases and are unusual in that they require visible
              light to undo the damage wrought by the mutagenic UV radiation. Upon absorption
              of visible light the repair process is complete within 2 nanoseconds. This
              research is aimed at understanding the molecular mechanism behind the
              light-driven repair reaction.
