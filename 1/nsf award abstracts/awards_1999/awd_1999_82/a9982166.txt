Abstract    :
              The project entitled "The Development and Analytical Application of Gas-phase
              Chiral Reactions" is directed by an established investigator with prior NSF
              support.  Professor Carlito Lebrilla of the University of California is
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program.    The purpose of
              the research is: (1) to study the fundamental nature of the chiral specificity
              of gas phase ion/molecule exchange reactions (2) to optimize and quantify the
              exchange reaction for chiral amino acids; (3) to test the method with other
              classes of compounds including chiral molecules of pharmaceutical importance. 
              The protonated amino acid-cyclodextrin complexes are stored in the homogeneous
              region of a 5.2 tesla superconducting magnet of a Fourier Transform Mass
              Spectrometer (FTMS).  The positively charged complex will be allowed to undergo
              collisions with neutral gaseous alkylamines.  The alkylamines undergo exchange
              reactions with the amino acids.  The rate of exchange is dependent on the
              chirality with one enantiomer reacting at rates up to four times faster than
              the other enantiomer.

This study will directly impact separation chemistry
              and mass spectrometry.  The methodology developed may prove useful to industry
              as a rapid means for the identification of new chiral stationary phases.  It
              may also prove useful in the pharmaceutical industry, where accurate
              measurement  and separation of enantiomers is vital, or in process control,
              where speed and specificity are needed, as in the analysis of chiral
              libraries.
