The objective of this research is to develop
              high-throughput atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study biomolecular
              interactions.  The high speed and low noise of prototype small-cantilever AFMs
              are advantageous for research on enzymatic reactions and other biomolecular
              interactions at the level of individual macromolecules. These studies will be
              carried out with the following three types of biomaterials: 
(1) DNA-protein
              and DNA-ligand complexes, (2) Extracellular matrix macromolecules and 
(3)
              Pseudomonas bacterial biofilms. This project brings together the leading-edge
              scanning probe microscopes available to the investigator's laboratory with
              leading-edge research in biomaterials at 
UC Santa Barbara. 

The research
              on high-throughput AFM has the potential to provide a valuable resource for
              some types of combinatorial chemistry.  Combinatorial chemistry generates huge
              numbers of products, which need to be analyzed by techniques capable of
              handling such huge numbers. The biomaterials research using small-cantilever
              AFMs will be valuable for helping the prototype small-cantilever AFMs evolve
              into user-friendly AFMs. Small-cantilever AFMs have the potential to become the
              next generation of commercial AFMs. This research educates students in the use
              of the AFM.
