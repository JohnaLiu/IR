Abstract    :
              After they finish dividing, neurons typically make long guided migrations to
              reach their proper loction in the brain.  The reelin gene is required for
              normal neuronal migration on the cerebellum, and more recently it has been
              found to have similar effects in other brain areas such as the cerebrl cortex. 
              However, despite the interest in this gene, it is not known whether it acts
              directly upon neurons or more indirectly through other intermediaries, or
              whether the protein product is inhibitory or stimulatory.  The applicant will
              use a novel system to examine this problem.  Preliminary data reveal that
              reelin regulates the migration of preganglionic sympathetic neurons and that
              this phenomenon can be mimicked in a simple in vitro slice system.  This system
              will used to: 1) map the migration of pregaglionic sympathetic neurons in mice;
              2) look at the spatiotemporal relationship between reelin protein and migration
              preganglionic neurons; and 3)use blocking antibodies and reelin producing cells
              to examine the biological activity of this protein.  Since disorders of neural
              migration are common in many forms of mental retardation, this research should
              provide insights into the causes of these devastating disorders.  Since
              molecules also interacts with apoE and VLDL, it could also be important in
              Alzheimer's disease.
