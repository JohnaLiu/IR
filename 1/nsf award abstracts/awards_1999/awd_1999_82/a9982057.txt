Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will enable the Chemistry Department at the University of Arizona to
              purchase a femtosecond laser system.  This equipment will be used primarily by
              junior faculty member Andrei Sanov, whose research focuses on ultrafast
              photoelectron imaging spectroscopy of negative ions and ionic clusters.  This
              equipment will allow Sanov to map out molecular orbital changes on a
              femtosecond time scale as reactions proceed.  

These studies will provide
              important insights into the coupling between nuclear and electronic dynamics. 
              In addition, the research program offers good educational opportunities for
              graduate and undergraduate students.
