Abstract    :
              
This project will reconstruct the growth and characteristics of woody support
              tissues of the first trees and shrubs that grew when early plants colonized the
              land in the Devonian (400-345 million years ago).  
The earliest plants lacked
              the roots, stems, branches, and leaves that are now found in modern plants. But
              by Mid to Late Devonian times, some plants had these features, and a few had
              developed growth capabilities and woody tissues that could support tall shrubs
              and trees. These first trees enjoyed considerable advantages by virtue of their
              height and spread, such as greater success of spore and seed dispersal and
              better competition for light and habitat space. 

The investigators will
              study cell patterns of fossil woods, stems, and roots to reconstruct the growth
              and mechanical features of these first woody plants.  Additionally, the
              fine-scale anatomical information obtained in this study will contribute to our
              knowledge of which plant groups (fossil and modern) are most closely related.
              The ability to produce wood appears to have evolved several times.  This study
              will resolve questions of the universality of plant construction design,
              specifically elucidating which common traits are necessary to attain a tree
              growth form and which are the result of a species' family history and are thus
              evolutionarily informative.
