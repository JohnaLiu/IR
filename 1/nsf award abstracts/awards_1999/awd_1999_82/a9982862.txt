Abstract    :
              Most communication between neurons in the brain occurs by the regulated
              secretion of a chemical transmitter at sites of contact, called synapses. 
              Functional studies have shown that the synaptic protein synaptotagmin in
              lethal.  Therefore, many biochemical studies have been conducted to
              characterize the interactions of synaptotagmin with other synaptic proteins in
              test tubes.  However, before one can understand how synaptotagmin regulates
              synaptic transmission, the functional significance of these biochemical
              interactions must be determined in animals.  Since synaptic proteins are highly
              conserved in fruit fly, Drosophila, this project combines the advantages of
              Drosophila genetic mutations know to disrupt specific protein interactions in
              test tubes, the investigators will establish the functional importance of the
              specifically mutated regions of synaptotagmin through a detailed analysis of
              synaptic structure and function in transgenic Drosophila.

Learning and
              memory, as well as various neurological disorders are thought to involve
              changes in the efficacy of transmitter secretion.  A thorough understanding of
              the molecular interactions mediating synaptic transmission is prerequisite for
              the development of therapies to enhance neural function.  This study will
              disclose the functional importance of specific interactions of synaptotagmin, a
              protein vital for regulating synaptic transmission.
