The objectives of this research are to carry out
              structural, calorimetric, and stability studies on mutants of staphylococcal
              nuclease and other proteins in which ionizable sidechains have been buried deep
              in the protein's hydrophobic core.  Earlier measurements have suggested that
              polarity in the core is much higher than had been previously believed. This
              project will probe the role of water molecules and other factors as a physical
              basis for this high polarity and seek to discover whether the observations in
              nuclease can be generalized to other proteins. In the mutant V66E, studied in
              collaboration with the laboratory of Bertrand Garcia-Moreno, the X-ray crystal
              structure shows four water molecules in the structure, connecting the glutamate
              sidechain with the protein surface.  This observation suggests that buried
              water molecules, ordered or disordered, may play a role in providing the
              observed polarity. 

Most biological function comes about through one protein
              molecule binding to another, or through a small molecule binding to a protein. 
              For example, muscle develops force when actin interacts with myosin, and
              steroid hormones (non-protein) exert their influence by binding to steroid
              hormone receptors (proteins). Efforts to create new catalysts (for transforming
              petroleum products for example) also depend on quantitative understanding of
              how one molecule binds to another.  One of the most important forces involved
              in stabilizing these interactions is the electrostatic force. This project on
              implanting charges within proteins should lead to a better understanding of the
              electrostatic force and so should help improve these methodologies.
