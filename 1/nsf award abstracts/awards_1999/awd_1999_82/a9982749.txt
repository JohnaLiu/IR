Abstract    :
              Arabidopsis thaliana provides a model system in which both molecular genetic and
              cell biology approaches can be used to evaluate and define the function of
              structural proteins in the plant cell wall.  Proline rich proteins (PRPs)
              represent afamily of structural cell wall proteins which have been implicated
              as contributing to maintenance of cell function and in generalized defense
              mechanisms in response to plant stress.  Transgenic plants expressing a tagged
              version of a PRP will be used to 1) explore the pattern of cell wall deposition
              for this protein during plant development; and 2) to examine the ability of
              this protein to become crosslinked within walls of different cell types. 
              Mutants altered in the development of cell types associated with the expression
              of this protein will also be characterized to determine if changes in cell
              shape and function observed in these mutants can disrupt or alter normal
              PRP/wall interactions.  Using a similar approach, several other members of the
              Arabidopsis PRP(AtPRP) gene family will be analyzed to determine if individual
              gene family members make unique contributions to extracellular matrix structure
              in specific cell types.  A PCR-based screen to identify potential T-DNA
              insertion mutants for several members of the AtPRP gene family will be
              initiated.  Mutants identified from these screens will be characterized at a
              molecular level and, if time permits, will be analyzed for phenotypes
              associated with the loss of AtPRP expression.
