This award supports a 2-year collaborative research project
              between Dr. Lawrence Que, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities and Professor
              Wonwoo Nam, EWHA Womans' University, Korea.   The proposed collaboration
              focuses on mechanistic studies on synthetic heme and nonheme iron complexes as
              models for their biological analogs.  Combining the expertise of Professor Nam
              on heme complexes and Dr. Que on nonheme complexes, the collaborators will
              compare and contrast the reactivities of heme and nonheme iron catalysts in
              hydrocarbon oxidations.

The cooperative project comprises of two parts.  The
              first part consists of mechanistic studies on alkane hydroxylation and alkene
              eposidation by iron catalysts. The reactivity of heme and nonheme iron
              complexes will be compared under various reaction conditions such as solvent
              and oxidant.  The second part of the project is the spectroscopic
              characterization of reaction intermediates when they are identified during the
              reaction.  The correlation of the reactivity and the spectroscopic properties
              of the intermediates will provide valuable information for the mechanisms of
              the enzymatic reactions in both the heme and the nonheme chemistry.

This
              project will be performed in conjunction with Professor Wonwoo Nam, EWHA
              Womans' University, Korea under the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program. 
              This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative
              Science Program, which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S.
              and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific
              information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on
              problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea
              Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
