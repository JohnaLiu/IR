Abstract    :
              A large number of studies show that animals respond to predation risk by
              lowering their activity or moving into safer habitats, but little is known
              about the ecological consequences of these behavioral shifts.  This research
              project will evaluate the role of behavioral flexibility in mediating species
              interactions in the food web of ponds and marshes. Freshwater snails move under
              cover or to the water's surface when confronted with fish or crayfish
              predators.  This habitat shift may affect the outcome of competition among
              different species or sizes of snails, force more snails into habitats with
              other predators, or lead to higher resource levels in dangerous habitats. 
              Chemical cues can be used to present snails with the perception of risk without
              affecting snail density, thereby separating the lethal and non-lethal effects
              of predators on prey. This approach will be used in a series of field
              experiments, and field observations to measure the non-lethal effects of
              predators on species interactions.  

This project will help establish
              whether induced behavioral responses are generally important in shaping
              communities.  The results will further our understanding of how natural
              communities function, thereby enhancing our ability to manage natural resources
              and conserve biological diversity.
