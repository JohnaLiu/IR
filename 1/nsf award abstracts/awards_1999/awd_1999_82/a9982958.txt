Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address in-line
              treatment for functionalization of commercial substrate surfaces.  The proposed
              treatment will consist of an appropriate combination of vacuum plasma
              treatment, atmospheric plasma treatment, and/or acrylate coating.  It is
              expected to functionalize the surface of commercial substrates such as
              packaging films, labeling sheet, paper webs, and Teflon(tm) sheet to readily
              accept and bond with solventless printing inks, thus reducing the need
              for
solvent-based inks.  The EPA Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) for 1995 shows
              that 1.224 billion pounds of organic solvents were released into the atmosphere
              over this country in 1995. The number 3 chemical (146 million pounds)
              contributing to TRI air emissions for 1995 was toluene, a major constituent of
              printing ink formulations.  Regulatory and community pressure to reduce the use
              of solvent-based inks as a pollution prevention measure is already a
              significant driving force and will only intensify in the future. 
              Proof-of-concept has been achieved in Phase I.  Sigma Technologies has indeed
              been able to alter the surface functionality of a variety of commercial
              substrates to the extent that water-based ink formulations will adhere well to
              the functionalized surfaces without sacrifice of ink deposit
              quality.

Several major players in the packaging film and related industries
              are very interested in our progress in the area of interface functionalization.
               They are under pressure from the USEPA to reduce their use of solvent-based
              inks and are operating in a highly competitive, often narrow margin, business
              venue.  They are watching us closely and at least two of these clients will
              participate in the proposed Phase II effort by providing in-kind matching funds
              expenditures to provide inking runs on treated substrates and to help
              us
evaluate ink deposit quality.  If we are able to maintain this high level
              of interest through the Phase II effort we are confident that firm orders for
              equipment and process development for Sigma Technologies will result.
