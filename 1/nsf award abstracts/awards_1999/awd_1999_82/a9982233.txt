A fundamental question in neuroscience is how
              connections are made and maintained among neurons and their targets.  A number
              of studies over the last 25 years have shown that neural wiring is exquisitely
              sensitive to experience, which is translated into neural activity.  Thus
              changes in neural activity can have a profound impact on neural connectivity. 
              Despite this appreciation, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.  We
              use the synaptic connection between motor neurons and muscle fibers, called
              neuromuscular junctions, as a model system to understand how neural activity
              changes neural connectivity.  We propose to study how the relative firing
              patterns of motor neurons change during postnatal development, and whether such
              change might modulate changes in synaptic connections at developing
              neuromuscular junctions.  During late embryonic and early postnatal life,
              skeletal muscle fibers undergo an activity-dependent, competitive transition
              from multiple to single innervation.  In developing muscle and brain,
              competition among motor units is modulated by their relative patterns of
              activity.  Temporally correlated patterns of motor unit activity might be
              present before competition begins, while asynchronous activity may lead to the
              loss of the least active inputs.  While this hypothesis is supported by many
              experimental manipulations, no studies have determined the relative activity
              patterns of motor neurons that impinges on neuromuscular synapses in vivo. 
              These experiments will also further our understanding of how neural activity
              shapes patterns of synaptic connectivity, not only during development, but
              throughout life.
