Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will enable the Department of Chemistry at the University of California
              in Riverside to purchase a gradient-equipped magic-angle-spinning probe and
              gradient amplifier for solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  This
              equipment will be used primarily by junior faculty member Leonard J. Mueller,
              whose research focuses on (1) the development of multidimensional solid-state
              NMR experiments for the structural determination of highly C-13 and N-15
              labeled biological samples; and (2) structural studies of hydrogen bonding in
              nucleic acids via solid-state NMR.  

This combination of state-of-the-art
              synthetic techniques and solid-state NMR will expand the capabilities of
              structural biology and for the first time allow a direct characterization and
              systematic study of hydrogen bond geometries in nucleic acids.
