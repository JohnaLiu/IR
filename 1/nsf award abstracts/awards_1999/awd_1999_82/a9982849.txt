Abstract

Specimen identification is
              one of the main tasks in biodiversity surveys. These surveys are conducted to
              evaluate the impact of local development as well as to evaluate the impact of
              global processes such as global environment change. They also aid in research
              that aims to understand the interdependencies between species. The specimen
              identification process is most difficult and time consuming for the
              non-professionals who are being called upon to aid in this work. Standard
              identification keys are difficult to use because of the rigid structure of the
              character representation. Interactive keys are an improvement but are difficult
              to construct and may not be the best approach for all situations. The PI
              proposes to increase the options by developing a Biological Information
              Browsing Environment (BIBE). BIBE would allow a user to visualize the contents
              of natural language descriptions from flora, fauna and other natural language
              species description collections. This visualization could then be used to
              facilitate specimen identification.
