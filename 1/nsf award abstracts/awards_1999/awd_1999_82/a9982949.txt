Lay Abstract

Circadian rhythms are fluctuations in
              behavioral and physiological activities over a ~24hr period.  Three core
              properties define such rhythms: 1) They are entrained by environmental cues
              such as light and temperature, 2) They persist (or free-run) under constant
              environmental conditions, and 3) They run at a rate that is relatively
              temperature insensitive.  Although circadian rhythms parallel environmental
              cycles of light and dark, they are not simply a reaction to environmental
              fluctuations, but are generated by an endogenous timekeeping system termed the
              circadian clock.  The importance of the circadian clock is underscored by its
              ubiquity; clocks are present in organisms ranging from microbes to plants,
              insects and mammals.  In every organisms tested to far, the lock is comprised
              of a circadian feedback loop in gene expression, where the rhythmic expression
              of core clock genes is controlled by the action of their own protein products. 
              We would like to know whether rhythmic expression of these core clock genes is
              needed to synchronize the clock to light and dark cycles or to maintain clock
              function in constant darkness.  We are using fruit flies to answer these
              questions because much is known about the core clock genes in this organism,
              the expression of these genes can be easily manipulated and clock function can
              be assessed by measuring rhythmic behavior.  Our plan is to express these core
              clock gees at constant levels and determine 1) if the flies can properly
              synchronize to light dark cycles and 2) whether they are rhythmic in constant
              darkness.  If the flies are arrhythmic or can't properly synchronize to
              light-dark cycles then rhythmic gene expression is an integral part of the
              circadian clock, but if synchronization and rhythmically are unaffected
              expression of core clock genes is dispensable for clock function.
