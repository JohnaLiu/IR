Abstract    :
              The cereals are the most important food crops in the world.  Determining the
              entire genomic sequence of a model cereal will reveal the basic gene set from
              monocot plants.  This award will support an experienced and productive team to
              participate in an international effort to determine the genomic blueprint of
              rice.  The project will involve sequencing and annotation of approximately 21
              Mb of contiguous rice genomic sequence over 3 years.  Initial emphasis will be
              placed on chromosome 10.  The overall project will be managed by Clemson
              University (CUGI) in collaboration with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL)
              and the Washington University (WUGSC). 160 130kb Nipponbare BAC clones anchored
              to a known chromosome site will be validated for insert integrity and
              chromosome location by CUGI. Shotgun library development and production
              sequencing of these clones will be performed at CSHL (64%) and CUGI (33%). 
              Finishing and automated annotation will occur at both sites.  WUGSC will lead a
              group in finishing technology development aimed at establishing robust
              chemistries that can be used by the consortium to finish difficult regions of
              the rice genome.  All sequence data will be immediately released to community
              databases (Genbank HTGS section) according to the "Bermuda" policies.  In
              addition, results will be published in scientific journals and annotated BAC
              clones will be displayed in an electronic form accessible to the scientific
              community.
