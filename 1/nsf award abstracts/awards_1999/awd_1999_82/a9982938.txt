Abstract    :
              The objective valuation of the world's ecological systems and services and its
              natural capital stocks is an issue of global importance.  The proposed activity
              applies a functional modeling approach to collected information archives.  The
              resulting analysis tools should prove useful to a broad sector of the science
              and policy making community.  The proposed activities would lead to a
              web-based, publicly accessible resource for primary data storage and subsequent
              modeling for use in policy development as well as scientific research.
