Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will enable the Physics Department at the University of
              Wisconsin-LaCrosse to purchase an optically pumped molecular laser system. 
              This equipment will be used primarily by junior faculty member Michael Jackson,
              whose research focuses on the detection and measurement of new optically pumped
              laser emissions in the far-infrared (FIR) region, particularly at wavelengths
              below 100 microns.  

These laser lines will be used as new coherent sources
              of radiation for laser Stark or laser magnetic resonance spectroscopy of
              molecules important in interstellar or atmospheric chemistry.   These research
              activities will involve the active participation of undergraduate students at
              the university.
