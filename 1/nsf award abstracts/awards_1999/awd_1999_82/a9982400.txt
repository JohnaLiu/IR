Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the mimicing of biological pathways to prepare a
              variety of polycyclic ether natural products. The project will develop
              methodology for the tandem endo-selective oxacyclizations of multiple cyclic
              sulfates; tandem endo-oxacyclizations of polyepoxides, including studies of
              substituent effects, electrophilic activating agents and other oxacyclic
              nucleophiles; and the biomimetic synthesis of hemibrevetoxin B from tandem
              oxidative cyclization of an acyclic prehemibevetoxin polyene precursor.

              this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research of Dr. Frank E. McDonald of the Department of Chemistry at Emory
              University.   Professor McDonald will focus his work on developing novel
              strategies for the biomimetic synthesis of trans-syn-trans fused polycyclic
              ethers.  This structural motif is found in many marine natural products that
              have important and interesting biological properties.
