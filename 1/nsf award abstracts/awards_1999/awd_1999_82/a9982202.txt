Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will enable the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wyoming to
              purchase a 270MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This
              equipment will be used primarily by junior faculty member Jeffery L. Yarger,
              whose research focuses on materials characterization and dynamics elucidation. 
              Research projects include nanocrystalline NMR characterization, optical
              pumping, polymerized alkali-C60 connectivity elucidated by solid state NMR,
              fundamental research on new fullerenes, such as C36, and high pressure
              characterization of super-pressed liquids and CMR materials.  

Solid state
              NMR has uses in many scientific fields besides materials chemistry, such as
              geology, physics, and biology.  It is imperative then, that students be exposed
              to various NMR techniques.  Thus, Dr. Yarger will incorporate modern solids NMR
              spectroscopy into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.
