Abstract    :
              The proposed research seeks to develop sophisticated dynamic graphics tools
              interactive exploratory analysis of very large datasets. These tools, when used
              in conjunction with data mining algorithms, will enable the user to (1) detect
              local departures from an overall trend, (2) detect structure in sparse high
              dimensional data, (3) select data dependent preprocessing steps (e.g.,
              scaling., normalization, feature extraction,) to enhance the effectiveness of
              automated numeric or symbolic "machine learning" algorithms, (4) refining
              solutions obtained with machine learning algorithms, (5) explore the
              differences in inductive and representational biases of alternative machine
              learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees versus neural networks), and (6)
              overview the data space as well as the complex relationships discovered by the
              data mining algorithms.
