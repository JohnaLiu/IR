This project is designed to probe the structure and
              function of the chlorophyll-binding protein CP 43 using mutagenesis techniques.
               CP 43 is a protein component of the Photosystem II (PSII) complex of higher
              plants, green algae and cyanobacteria (blue-green algae).  PSII uses light
              energy from the sun to drive the splitting of water molecules with concomitant
              release of molecular oxygen to the atmosphere.  Virtually all of the oxygen
              present in our atmosphere arises from water oxidation by PSII.  The CP 43
              protein is embedded in the thylakoid membrane; however, it contains several
              extrinsic loop regions, including a large extrinsic loop E, which protrude from
              the membrane into the interior (lumen) of the thylakoid (the site of water
              oxidation).  CP 43 is known to play a role in the light-harvesting process. 
              However, accumulating data point to additional roles for CP 43 in the stable
              assembly of the PS II complex and in the water splitting (oxygen-evolving)
              process.  

The PI hypothesizes that domains on the lumenal surface of CP 43,
              and in particular the large extrinsic loop E, interact with components of the
              oxygen-evolving complex. The PI's laboratory is testing this hypothesis by
              using genetic engineering techniques to produce mutants in all the lumenal
              extrinsic loops.  This is accomplished by introducing specific base pair
              changes in regions of the psbC gene encoding the lumenal loops of CP 43, and
              then introducing the altered genes back into our model organism, the
              cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. The organism then produces a mutant protein
              containing a single amino acid substitution in one of the extrinsic loops.  To
              date the PI has focused on alteration of charged amino acid residues in the
              lumenal domains.  Twenty-one mutants at twenty-two sites in the large extrinsic
              loop E of the CP 43 protein of Synechocystis 6803 have been constructed.  Four
              of these mutants assemble PSII centers but are impaired in PSII activity.  One
              additional mutant fails to assemble any functional centers and thus is devoid
              of PSII activity.  Eleven other amino acids in lumenal loops are targeted for
              mutagenesis.  A combination of physiological, biochemical and biophysical
              techniques will be employed to analyze and further characterize these
              mutants.
