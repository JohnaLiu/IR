Abstract    :
              
Vertebrates feed in a diversity of ways, from the large, sucking mouths of
              many fishes to sticky, projectile tongues of some lizards and salamanders, to
              the powerful, tearing jaws and teeth of large cats.  Although biologists have
              long recognized the bones and muscles of the skull have undergone significant
              evolution as feeding strategies have diversified in different vertebrate
              groups, work over the last 20 years has suggested that the neural circuitry
              responsible for controlling feeding behavior may be relatively inflexible over
              evolutionary time.  Some workers have suggested that the complexity of neural
              circuits makes them resistant to evolutionary change.  Innovations in feeding
              behavior are thus thought to be accomplished by changes in muscle and/or bone
              shape and not changes in the "hard-wiring" or neural control of the muscles
              themselves.

The goals of this symposium are to evaluate these ideas about
              neural circuit conservatism by examining feeding patterns across vertebrates. 
              Biologists from around the world working on fishes, sharks, frogs, turtles,
              lizards, mammals, and birds, will come together to discuss the patterns of
              skull and jaw movement and motor control evident in each of these groups.  By
              identifying trends within each of these major groups and synthesizing patterns
              apparent across them, workers will refine current models of vertebrate feeding
              and explore new and potentially fruitful avenues of research for the
              future.
