Abstract    :
              The goal for the proposed research is to determine whether energy supply limits
              reproductive activity in male mammals and to analyze the mechanisms by which
              this might occur. The following questions will be explored: 1) What components
              of behavior affect male mating success?  2) What is the source of energy that
              fuels mating activity?  3) Is mating success limited by energy supply in one
              form or another?  These questions will be addressed in a field study which (1)
              simultaneously measures male reproductive behavior, energy expenditure and
              changes in body composition during the breeding period (2) manipulates fat
              stores to directly assess the extent to which this limits male reproductive
              behavior.

This research probes a fundamental paradigm in ecology and
              behavior: that energy is limiting reproductive success and that variation in
              energy availability and energy allocation leads to variation in reproductive
              success.  This idea has been little studied beyond the obvious extreme: poor
              condition leads to little or no reproduction and survival may be affected in
              periods of stress. How energy limitation affects male mating success is
              particularly interesting due to the emphasis that body condition has in
              interpretations of mate choice and intrasexual competition. This study should
              provide novel insights into the role of energy limitation in animal behavior
              and ecology.
