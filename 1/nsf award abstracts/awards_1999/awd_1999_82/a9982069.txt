Abstract    :
              The profound effect that information technology is having on the global society
              and economy dictates the development of means to enable global access to the
              huge volumes of currently disorganized and relatively unstructured materials
              that are now available to all members of society for business and pleasure,
              teaching and scholarship.   This project aims to define the dimensions of a
              core international infrastructure that can support the creation of a
              multi-lingual multi-word expression lexicon incorporating both morpho-syntactic
              and semantic information, and which will provide a base for building pivotal
              natural language applications aiming at management of, and universal access to,
              the vast quantity of information that is becoming available each day via the
              World Wide Web. In particular, the PI's aims are:  To establish uniform
              standards for describing multi-word lexical entries at the levels of syntax and
              morpho-syntax and lexical semantics;   To identify realistic objectives for the
              representation of phrasal expressions in a multi-lingual lexicon, in terms of
              size, scope, existing usable input, additional input and links to other lexical
              resources, and information types still to be acquired;   To determine the type
              and dimensions of the information that will best serve the needs of critical
              NLP applications;   To specify an overall architecture for a joint software and
              "lingware" development project;   To specify the outline of a collaborative
              project to acquire and represent multi-word lexical entries for multiple
              languages;   To explore the feasibility and dimensions of the eventual project
              by creating a small number of multi-word entries for support verbs, and
              including syntax and morpho-syntax;   And to explore the possibilities of
              recognizing and acquiring a repertory of multi-word lexical units from corpora
              by means of partial parsing, statistics, etc. This research will lay the ground
              for development of a multi-lingual lexicon for multi-word expressions, an
              important and essential resource to support the future IT environment.    In
              this way, the work will contribute directly to the creation of a universally
              accessible, multi-lingual and multi-cultural information infrastructure for
              individuals and organizations across the globe.
