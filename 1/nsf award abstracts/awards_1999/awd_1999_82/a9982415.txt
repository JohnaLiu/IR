Abstract    :
              Ernie Davidson of Indiana University is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop new quantum chemical techniques for
              understanding chemical concepts applicable to entire classes of reactions. 
              Specifically, density functional theory (DFT) will be reformulated for
              intermediate spin states, and applied to small magnetic manganese clusters. 
              DFT, Green's function methods, and conventional quantum chemical methods will
              all be used to investigate photoelectron processes in hydrocarbons and small
              inorganic anions.  Insight is expected to be gained for both spectral
              assignments and the possible breakdown of orbital interpretations.  Other
              applications include inorganic reaction mechanisms involving ruthenium
              complexes, and the photofragmentation of small peptides.

Computational
              quantum chemistry is very proficient at describing the properties of stable
              species, but is less accurate for reacting molecules.  Part of this research
              aims to develop methods that are designed to follow chemical reactions and
              predict their outcomes.  This will have implications in catalysis, laser
              ablation in computer chip manufacture, and peptide sequencing by mass spectral
              methods.  Another part of this research focuses on improved theoretical
              descriptions of magnetic materials such as molecular magnets.
