Abstract    :
              The impact of this work will be threefold. The immediate result will be a
              prototype system for using software visualization for understanding.
              Educationally, the work will expose students to visualization as a means of
              understanding and get them interested and involved in working on the difficult
              problems inherent in visualization and understanding. Finally, the broader
              impact of this project will be to establish foundations for future software
              visualization and understanding efforts by solving some of the basic problems
              in these areas.
