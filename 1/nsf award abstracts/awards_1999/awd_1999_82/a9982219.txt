Abstract    :
              This award supports an important study of the impacts of the Internet and PC
              technology on society and families. Using survey methods and well-accepted
              techniques for social science data analysis, the research 
team will conduct a
              long-term longitudinal study. An important component of the work will include
              involvement with comparable research teams in several other countries. The
              project is undertaken under the auspices of the UCLA Center for Communications
              Policy. Research results will be disseminated, and research data will be made
              available for others to use in further study and analysis.
