Communication between nerve cells serves as the basis
              of all brain activity. One of the fundamental steps involved in signal
              transmission between the nerve cells, is the conversion of a chemical signal
              liberated at the end of one nerve cell, into an electrical signal at the second
              nerve cell. This step is mediated by a class of membrane bound proteins known
              as neurotransmitter receptors. One member of this family is the glutamate
              receptor. These receptors bind to the chemical signaling molecule glutamate
              (ligand) and generate an electrical signal through the formation of
              transmembrane ion channels. In the proposed studies, Dr. Jayaraman will attempt
              to understand the interactions whereby the glutamate receptor protein
              specifically recognizes ligands such as glutamate. The ligand-protein
              interactions will be investigated by probing the vibrations of the ligand and
              the ligand-binding segment of the glutamate receptor using spectroscopic tools.
              Since, the vibrations of these chemical moieties are controlled by their
              atomic-level environment, probing the vibrations with infrared light will
              provide insight into the interaction between the protein and the ligand.
              Furthermore, extending these studies to study the changes in the protein
              structure upon ligand binding in a time-resolved manner, will suggest the
              pathway by which the protein form the ion channels upon binding the ligand.
              These high-resolution structural studies are required for a basic understanding
              of interactions that control protein-ligand recognition and will eventually
              allow the design of drugs that can alter the behavior of glutamate receptors.
              Such drugs may be useful in the treatment of traumatic head injury, and memory
              problems.
