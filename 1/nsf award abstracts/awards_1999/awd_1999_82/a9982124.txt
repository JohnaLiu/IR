The PI proposes to investigate the role of an omnivorous fish,
              the gizzard shad, in the resistance and resilience of aquatic food webs to
              perturbations in the form of large pulses of nutrients.  They hypothesize that
              food webs with omnivorous fish, like these shad, are more stable (i.e.,
              resistant and resilient) in repines to perturbations of allochthonous nutrients
              than are those without omnivorous fish.  The enhanced stability might be due to
              the large steady supply of nutrients transported by omnivorous fish from
              sediments or to the additional trophic links formed by incorporating the
              omnivorous fish in the food webs.  The objectives of this work are to test
              predictions generated by the omnivory-stability hypothesis and to determine the
              underlying mechanisms responsible for observed changed in stability. 
              Replicated pond experiments will be performed to assess how fish influence
              resistance and resilience of food webs to pulses of nutrients, and if so,
              whether the mechanism is via nutrient-transport or via a food web-structure
              role, or both.  Modeling will also be used to explore the role of omnivorous
              fish in the stability of aquatic food webs over a range of ecosystem structures
              and perturbation types.
