              structures and cellular components participating in associative (Pavlovian)
              odor learning and memory have been identified by genetic, transgenic and cell
              ablation studies in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  Anatomical defects
              in brain structures called mushroom bodies (MBs) and biochemical defects in
              signal transduction have each (separately) been linked with reduced learning
              and memory.  Investigations here are divided in two parts and focus on a
              collection of five Drosophila mutants that have reduced MB phenotypes (mbm,
              mbmB, mbmC, mbr and smu).  The first goal is to correlate anatomical and memory
              defects in these mutants with gene expression patterns in MBs.  This will test
              the hypothesis that genetically defined MB subdivisions are sites of specific
              biochemical processes underlying one or more sequential phases of memory
              consolidation.  The second goal is to establish an accurate genetic map for
              each of the MB structure genes and to isolate new transposon-tagged mutant
              alleles.  These new alleles will facilitate rapid entry to molecular analyses
              of MB structure genes.  The long-term hypothesis is that MB structural gene
              products function in MB development, memory consolidation, or common aspects of
              both.  The overall significance of the proposed work is an integration of
              neuroanatomical and biochemical mechanisms underlying behavioral plasticity
