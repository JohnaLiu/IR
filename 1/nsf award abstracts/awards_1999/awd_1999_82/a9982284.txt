Virion morphogenesis is often dependent on viral scaffolding
              proteins. Analogous to scaffoldings used in building construction, these
              proteins direct the assembly of viral components into infectious agents, but
              are not found in the final product. Different regions, or domains, within
              scaffolding proteins, and all proteins in general, perform different functions.
              And with genetic engineering, it is possible to determine the functions of
              these domains. In these studies, the functional domains of the Microviridae
              scaffolding proteins are elucidated in experiments conducted with chimeric
              proteins. These chimeras are constructed from protein sequences derived from
              different, but evolutionarily related viruses. Some chimeric proteins can only
              perform a subset of the functions performed by the naturally occurring
              proteins. When these partially functional proteins interact within other viral
              components they can inhibit morphogenesis, preventing virus replication. In
              turn, viruses can mutate to become resistant to the inhibitory effects of the
              genetically engineered proteins. It is expected that the results of these
              studies will provide insights into the design of recombinant proteins,
              strategies for possible antiviral agents, mechanisms of resistance to antiviral
              agents and virion morphogenesis.
