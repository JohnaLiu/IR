Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to define the mechanisms that regulate the activity
              of D-raf in receptor tyrosinekinase mediated signaling pathways for the
              establishment and elaboration of pattern in Drosophila melanogaster.  Using a
              structure/function approach we have defined D-raf regulatory domains that are
              required for signaling in the maternal Torso pathway to specify cell fates at
              the embryonic poles.  Our studies have revealed that transmission of the
              terminal signal depends on the activity of a novel regulatory branch, termed
              the "inhibitory branch", which (i) acts in parallel with the Torso receptor
              tyrosine kinase: (ii) is dependent on the maternal activities of the trunk and
              fs(1) pole hole genes; and (iii) involves the regulation of D-raf at serine
              residue 388.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  (1) to define
              similarities and differences in mechanisms of regulation by expressing D-raf
              domains in Torso and Drosophila EGFR pathways.  (2) to begin a saturation
              screen for mutations affecting the "inhibitory branch" of the terminal
              signaling pathway.  (3) to complete a two-hybrid screen using the D-rafCR2
              module (conserved region 2) containing serine 388 to identify "inhibitory
              branch" factor(s) that interact with D-raf.  Since D-raf is the Drosophila
              homologue of the Raf-1 proto-oncogene, characterization of its role in
              development and identification of the mechanisms involved in its regulation
              will provide clues to understand the process of signal transduction in higher
              organisms.
