Proteasomes are large protein complexes found within all
              eukaryotic cells that degrade proteins targeted for removal.  The proteasome is
              critically involved in all aspects of cellular metabolism and is essential for
              cell viability. Proteasomes are composed of a core particle and a regulatory
              particle that binds substrate proteins, unfolds them, and feeds them into the
              core particle for degradation.  The unfolding of the substrate proteins
              requires energy supplied by ATP.  The regulatory particle contains six highly
              similar ATPases central to the functioning of the proteasome.  These ATPases
              are thought to form a ring at the interface of the core and regulatory
              particles.  While the organization of the core particle has been determined by
              x-ray crystallography, the organization of the regulatory particle is still
              unknown. 
In these studies, working with the model eukaryote Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae (bakers yeast), a number of techniques will be used to determine the
              organization of the six ATPases within the regulatory particle.  In addition
              ATPase/substrate interactions will be investigated and a series of novel
              mutations in one of the ATPases (Sug1p) isolated and characterized.  These
              experiments will serve as a framework to probe the dynamic operation of an
              essential cellular component.
