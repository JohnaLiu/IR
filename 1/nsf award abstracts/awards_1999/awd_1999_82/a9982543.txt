Abstract    :
              Yew 
Cell division is one of the most fundamental processes in living
              organisms.  A critical part of cell division is the duplication of the genome
              during S phase, an event not well characterized in higher eukaryotes.  Recent
              work has shown that the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, Cdc34, in a large
              molecular size complex is required for the onset of DNA replication in egg
              extracts of the frog, Xenopus laevis.  How Cdc34 and its as yet unidentified
              associated components function to regulate DNA replication in a vertebrate is
              not known.  This research will test the hypothesis that Cdc34 and other
              associated components target key cell cycle regulators for ubiquitin-mediated
              degradation, triggering the initiation of DNA replication in vertebrates. 
              Xenopus interphase egg extracts will be used as a cell-free vertebrate model
              system to study the regulatory events surrounding the initiation of DNA
              replication.  The specific goal of this research is to accomplish the following
              aims: (1) To identify and functionally characterize the Cdc34-associated
              protein complex that regulates the onset of DNA replication.  This will be
              achieved by the identification and cloning of the components associated with
              Cdc34, which are required for the onset of DNA replication.  These components
              will then be studied to determine for the functional and biophysical
              characteristics of the complex in association with Cdc34.  (2) To define the
              role of Cdc34 in regulating the initiation of DNA replication by determining
              how Cdc34 may influence the assembly of the replication complex.  This will be
              accomplished by performing cell localization and chromatin centrifugation
              studies to determine whether Cdc34 activity influences the formation of the
              replication complex during the onset of S phase.
