The accurate transmission of information within the nervous
              system depends on the precise connections that neurons make with each other. To
              form these connections, axons must navigate over long distances to their target
              regions during development. Both long-range attractive or repulsive molecules,
              and short-range cues promoting selective adhesion, can guide axon outgrowth.
              The connections formed in the visual system are particularly intriguing, as
              they result in a precise mapping of the retina onto the brain, suggesting that
              each cell can sense its global position. Our understanding of the determinants
              of this positional information is far from complete. A genetic approach using
              the fruit fly Drosophila has the potential to identify new components mediating
              axon guidance, purely on the basis of their function. 
	A genetic screen for
              mutations affecting the connections formed by photoreceptor axons in Drosophila
              has been initiated. The screen uses a mosaic approach that allows the
              identification of mutations in genes that are also required earlier in
              development. This screen is also rapid and favors the isolation of mutations
              that have defects specific to axon pathfinding. Mutations in two genes that
              control a pathfinding step specific to a particular photoreceptor have been
              identified. The proteins encoded by these genes will now be characterized in
              order to understand the basis for their functions in axon guidance. The screen
              will also be continued to obtain a more complete picture of the genetic
              requirements for the visual system projection pattern.
