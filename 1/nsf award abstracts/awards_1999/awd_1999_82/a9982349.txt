Tomographic imaging is used in a variety of scientific,
              industrial, national security, and medical applications.  Since tomographic
              imaging problems generally are ill-posed, the reconstructed images can be
              severely degraded by measurement noise, unless one employs adequate
              regularization methods.  Conventional quadratic regularization methods have the
              undesirable property of producing nonuniform and anisotropic spatial resolution
              properties when applied to photon-limited emission computed tomography (SPECT).
               These properties cause noticeable distortion of object shape in reconstructed
              images, such as elongation of tumors in PET scans, and can cause nonuniform
              contrast in thin structures such as the myocardium in cardiac SPECT scans. 
              These deficiencies may impact the diagnostic accuracy of PET and SPECT imaging.
               The goals of this research project are to develop, analyze, and evaluate
              improved regularization methods of tomographic image reconstruction,
              particularly in the context of PET and SPECT imaging.  Current commercially
              available iterative image reconstruction algorithms for SPECT and PET are all
              based on unregularized methods.  The methods developed in this project will
              improve the suitability of regularized methods for routine use in tomographic
              imaging by providing uniform spatial resolution where appropriate, and by
              improving the bias-variance tradeoffs of regularized image reconstruction
              methods.
