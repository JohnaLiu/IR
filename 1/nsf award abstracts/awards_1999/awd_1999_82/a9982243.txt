Abstract    :
              
This award renews support for a large collection of fungi and yeast maintained
              by the American Type Culture Collection.  The mission of the ATCC Mycological
              Collection is to acquire, authenticate, preserve,
and distribute fungi and
              yeasts, as well as to provide information and standards for their use in
              research, education and industry.   Through this direct support, the NSF
              provides slightly less than 10% of the cost of the collection.  Additional
              funding is provided from other federal sources, but the major sources of
              funding are from user fees and institutional funds.  

The collection
              presently maintains approximately 29,000 fungal strains representing over 7,000
              species and 1,500 genera, and distributes more than 9,000 cultures a year. 
              Approximately 3000 strains were added to the collection during the last 5
              years.  A modest charge is made for each culture.  This is one of the largest
              and most important fungal collections in the world, and the only such general
              purpose collection in this country.
