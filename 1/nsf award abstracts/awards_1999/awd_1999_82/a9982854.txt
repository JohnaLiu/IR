Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is the development of a fundamental understanding
              of how dynamic interactions involving microemulsion constituents, catalytic
              films, and reactants influence reaction rates in electrochemical systems. 
              Results will guide the development of new electrodes and reaction systems
              designed specifically for microemulsions.  Electrochemical addition and
              cyclization reactions will be targeted for ultimate application to the
              synthesis of fine chemicals including lactones, pheromones, and optically
              active olefins and alcohols.  A key issue to be addressed is the influence of
              micellized surfactant within catalytic polymer layers on catalyst formal
              potentials and catalytic activity.  New catalytic electrodes specifically for
              carbon-carbon bond forming syntheses in microemulsions will be developed.
              Effects of property-altering modifications of polylysine-cobalt complex films
              will be explored.  Compositions of microemulsions and properties of catalytic
              coatings will be tuned for best reaction rates and pathways for key reactions. 
              The broad impact of this work will be to provide fundamental guidance for the
              design of efficient mediated electrochemical synthetic processes in relatively
              inexpensive, low toxicity, water based media.
