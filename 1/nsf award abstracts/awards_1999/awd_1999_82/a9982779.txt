Abstract    :
              The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many aspects of
plant growth
              and development affecting crop productivity, including
embryogenesis, water
              relations and tolerance of a variety of environmental
stresses.  Our long-term
              goal is to study the function and interaction of
elements involved in response
              to ABA. One gene required for normal ABA
response, the Arabidopsis
              ABA-insensitive 5 (ABI5) locus, has been
identified by positional cloning in
              our lab and found to encode a protein
with homology to the bZIP-domain class
              of transcription factors.  The
experiments outlined in this proposal will
              characterize the expression and
biochemical function of ABI5, and investigate
              its interactions with other
gene products in coordinating seed development and
              response to ABA.  Our
hypothesis is that ABI5 participates in seed- and/or
              ABA-regulation of gene
expression, possibly in combination with other
              transcription factors. These
studies should have general relevance to
              understanding the signaling
network(s) regulating embryonic and hormonally
              regulated gene expression.
Furthermore, they may have practical significance
              for potential
manipulation of seed nutritional and storage qualities or
              vegetative stress
tolerance.
