Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will enable the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois
              in Urbana-Champaign to purchase a picosecond fluorescence spectrometer.  This
              equipment will be used primarily by junior faculty member Christopher Bardeen,
              whose research focuses on the use of optical techniques with high temporal and
              spatial resolution to observe dynamics in complex systems in materials science
              and biology.  Specifically, Dr. Bardeen will study the dynamics of energy and
              charge transport in conjugated polymers; and the photochemistry of
              photosensitizers in biological media.  

In materials science, conjugated
              polymers and oligomers are of interest for applications in light emitting
              diodes and flat panel displays.  In biology, fluorescent dyes are commonly used
              as labels for examination of intracellular biochemistry.  More recently,
              photosensitizers have been used for the treatment of many diseases, including
              cancer, in a procedure known as photodynamic therapy.
