              Abstract

This award provides renewed funding for the Indiana University
              Axolotl Colony, a self-sustaining, breeding colony of the Mexican axolotl
              (Ambystoma mexicanum). The Colony is a genetic stock center dedicated to the
              supply of genetically well-characterized axolotl embryos, larvae, and adults to
              laboratories throughout the United States and abroad.  The IU Colony currently
              provides 50,000 embryonic, larval, juvenile and adult animals to researchers
              and educators each year.

The axolotl, a neotenic salamander, is a
              non-mammalian model system with a  number of features that are advantageous in
              experimental studies of vertebrate developmental biology, neuroscience, and
              immunology.  These include large oocytes that display lampbrush chromosomes;
              large, polyspermic eggs that are suitable for nuclear transplantation and that
              can be easily manipulated to obtain haploids or polyploid embryos; large,
              accessible embryos that tolerate microsurgery well; large individual nerve
              cells; and the ability to regenerate limbs and organs.
