Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will enable the Department of Chemistry at the University of Puerto
              Rico in Rio Piedras to purchase UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry apparatus
              with ultraviolet (UV), visible (Vis) and near infrared (NIR) capabilities. 
              This equipment will be used primarily by junior faculty member Raphael Raptis,
              whose research focuses on the investigation of systematic structural
              rearrangements of metal/sulfur clusters, specifically the stabilization of
              electrogenerated species in chilled solution and in situ spectroscopic
              characterization.  

While various metal clusters occur in nature in the
              active centers of proteins and in minerals, a much larger number of cluster
              molecules have been synthesized in the laboratory in efforts to model proteins
              and catalyst surfaces.  Metal-chalcogenide clusters make up a major part of
              this field.   In spite of the intense research activity in this area, the
              synthesis of metal-chalcogenide clusters and clusters in general, has relied
              heavily on serendipitous discoveries.  These studies will broaden our
              understanding of the synthesis of these important metal clusters.
