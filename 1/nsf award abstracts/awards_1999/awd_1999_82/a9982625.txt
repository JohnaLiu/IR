Abstract    :
              This award to Professor John Brennan at Rutgers University, is supported by the
              Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division.  The focus
              of the research will be synthesis and characterization of lanthanum-based
              chalcogenides and pnictides as molecules, clusters and solid-state materials
              for applications  in optical and electronic devices.   For applications in
              light emitting diodes, fiber optics and environmentally safe pigments, solid
              state materials will be synthesized at low temperatures from lanthanum-based
              precursor molecules and clusters.

Molecules, clusters and solid-state
              materials based on lanthanum will be prepared and characterized under this
              research. Because of their unique chemistry and structure, these
              lanthanum-based materials will have optical and electronic properties not
              observed in other materials.  In addition, the interdisciplinary approaches of
              the project will provide knowledge and training to students in materials
              chemistry, synthesis and characterization.
