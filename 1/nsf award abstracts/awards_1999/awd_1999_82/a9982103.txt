Abstract    :
              This project employs nuclear magnetic resonance as a means of studying the
              nature of the hydrogen bond as well as other ion solvation and anomeric
              effects.  A major objective of the proposed research is to determine
              experimentally the symmetry of a variety of hydrogen bonds.  Concerning ion
              solvation, a newly developed NMR titration method is a powerful one for
              obtaining a quantitative measure of the steric demands of ionic species. 
              Finally, clarification is sought as to the extent of anomeric stabilization
              when the electronegative groups are ionic.

With this Award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support of the research of
              Professor Charles L. Perrin of the University of California San Diego. 
              Professor Perrin employs spectroscopic techniques similar to magnetic resonance
              imaging but on a molecular scale, in such a way that dynamic chemical processes
              and structures can be elucidated.  The major aim of the research project is the
              characterization of the hydrogen bond, which is the type of bond by which the
              molecules of life adopt and maintain their three-dimensional shapes.
