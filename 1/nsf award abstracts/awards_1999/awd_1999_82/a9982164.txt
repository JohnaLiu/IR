This award supports a 2-year collaborative research project
              between Dr. Stephen Hsu, University of Oregon, Eugene, and Professor D. K.
              Hong, Pusan University, Korea.  The proposed research aims to collaborate in
              the study of theoretical issues related to nuclear matter at extremely high
              density.  

This area of research is relevant to neutron star physics as well
              as the experimental program at heavy ion colliders such as RHIC (Brookhaven
              National Lab) and LHC (CERN).  Their expertise is in the application of
              theoretical tools such as the renormalization group, effective field theory and
              Schwinger-Dyson equations to problems in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  One of
              the primary interests is the phenomenon of color superconductivity in quark
              matter, which is similar in some aspects to ordinary superconductivity in
              metals.

This project will be performed in conjunction with Professor Hong at
              Pusan University, Korea under the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program.  
              This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative
              Science Program, which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S.
              and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific
              information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on
              problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea
              Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
