Abstract    :
              Many birds change during growth or seasonal cycles from eating diets low in
              protein, such as seeds, to diets high in protein, such as insects.  In mammals,
              changing to a high protein diet induces a number of changes in the kidneys,
              including enlargement of the organs and changes in the production and
              composition of the urine.  In humans, these changes are important contributors
              to the progression of renal failure, and there is concern about these
              consequences also associated with the current popularity of high protein/low
              carbohydrate dieting.  Birds possess many of the same elements to their anatomy
              and physiology as are suggested to be involved in the mammalian response to
              eating protein; however, birds lack others of these elements.  Thus, birds can
              serve as a natural model for testing theories about the links between diet and
              consequences for the kidneys.  In the proposed studies, Dr. Goldstein will
              explore the ways in which diet influences the responsiveness of the kidneys to
              hormones released in response to feeding.  He will do so by raising bobwhite
              quail on high-vs.-low protein diets, and then exploring organ structure, kidney
              function, and the biochemical responses of kidney cells and tissues.  These
              studies will help to define the physiology of a bird (the bobwhite quail) that
              is valuable both as a domestic and a wildlife species.  They will also clarify
              assumptions and hypotheses proposed for mammalian kidneys, and thereby help to
              elucidate the link between dietary protein and the progression of renal
              failure.
