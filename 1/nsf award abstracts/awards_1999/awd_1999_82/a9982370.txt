Abstract    :
              During development, organisms may increase dramatically in size, and many switch
              the type of food they eat and the way they capture it. At the same time, their
              environment may change unpredictably and suddenly.  In marine systems, the
              temperature may spike, and storms may alter salinity or transport small larvae
              long distances. Thus, many immature stages are often more sensitive to
              environmental change than are adults.  Yet for a species to persist, members
              must be successful at each stage of development, and during the transitions
              between them. 

On January 4th, as part of the 2001 Annual Meeting of the
              Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, researchers from four nations
              will gather for a symposium, "Ontogenetic Strategies of Invertebrates in
              Aquatic Environments". This symposium explores the way that fundamental systems
              such as eyes, hormones, and behavior change during development. What can be
              learned about evolution from novel solutions? What can be learned from common
              strategies in diverse groups? Exploring patterns in a diversity of organisms
              will yield insights into basic principles of successful developmental patterns
              and strategies.
