Abstract    :
              A planning grant is requested to establish a multi-disciplinary effort at UCLA
              to apply wireless, mobile networking to support seamless transition of
              applications across heterogeneous clients for patient record retrieval in
              medical settings.  The planning grant will be used to establish a very small
              testbed with heterogeneous devices that include desktop computers, laptops, and
              hand held devices, to provide an environment in which to deploy an early
              prototype of the proposed system.  The testbed will also allow us to enhance
              interactions among the researchers from different disciplines and the campus
              telecommunications facility to prepare for an eventual full throttled 
              deployment of the system.  Lastly, the small physical testbed will allow us to
              cleanly separate the advanced development concerns from the more
              research-oriented issues such that we can deploy the system using state of the
              art COTS tools while simultaneously  pursuing research ideas to influence the
              next generation of the proposed environment.
