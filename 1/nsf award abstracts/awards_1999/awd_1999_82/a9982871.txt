Major histocompatibilities (MHC) class I molecules bind virus
              and tumor derived peptides intracellularly and transport these peptides to the
              cell surface.  Cells must express the MHC class I molecules in order to be
              identified and killed by immune cells termed T-cells.  MHC class I molecules
              are constituitively found on almost all cells, except cells in the central
              nervous system (CNS).  Within the CNS, inflammatory stimuli induce MHC class I
              surface expression on glia, but not neurons.  This may protect neurons from
              destruction by the immune system.  Recent studies have suggested that neurons
              regulate MHC class I expression in both neurons and glia.  The current study is
              designed to determine the mechanisms underlying neuronal regulation of MHC
              class I expression on neurons and glia through cell-cell contact and soluble
              mediators.  The studies will be achieved by applying standard
              immunocytochemical and molecular biology techniques to purified and mixed
              neuronal-glial cultures of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons, postnatal
              cerebella granule cell neurons, and postnatal astrocytes.

These studies will
              provide important information concerning the mechanisms by which neurons avoid
              immuno-surveillance, potentially resulting in persistent viral infections.  In
              addition, the studies will provide new insights into the unique role that
              neurons play regulating immune function in the CNS.
