Abstract    :
              Many crabs are able to survive in environments where salinity fluctuates widely,
              although this ability varies substantially even within a given genus. 
              Osmoregulation, maintaining a constant internal salinity when external salinity
              fluctuates, requires transport of salt into or out of the body.  Salt transport
              occurs across specialized cell layers and is mediated by salt transport
              proteins.

This work will focus on development of an antibody against
              invertebrate salt (Na-K-Cl) cotransporters and will demonstrate the ability to
              detect Na-K-Cl cotransporters in fiddler crabs.  Developing species-specific
              antibodies against fiddler crab cotransporters will require cloning
              transporters from each species.  The full-length sequence of the blue crab
              Na-K-Cl cotransporter is now in the sequence database.  This sequence from a
              related organism will facilitate the cloning efforts.  Preliminary evidence
              will be collected to demonstrate that invertebrate cation-chloride
              cotransporters can be successfully expressed and characterized using the Sf9
              cell expression system.  Data will be accumulated to show that there are
              changing expression patterns in gill proteins after salinity stress.  In
              particular, these analyses will focus on demonstrating differences between
              anterior and posterior gills.
