Abstract    :
              The research program entitled "Polymer Analysis by Laser Desorption Fourier
              Transform Mass Spectrometry" is performed by Dr. Charles Wilkins at the
              University of Arkansas and is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program of the Chemistry Division.  The purpose of this research is to develop
              new methodologies for the analysis of polymers and copolymers by matrix
              assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Fourier transform mass
              spectrometry (FTMS).  Fundamental studies on the mechanism of cationization and
              basic MALDI processes will be performed.  Additional fundamental studies on the
              newly discovered ion activation process, which utilizes low voltage
              on-resonance ion selection (LOIS), will also be made.  The analytical
              procedures developed as a result of these fundamental studies will be applied
              to the characterization of polymer and copolymer materials.

This research
              represents advances in both the fundamental understanding of ionization
              processes as they affect polymer analysis and the application of this
              understanding to the development of new methods for the analysis of  polymer
              materials, which are very difficult to analyze.  This research will impact
              future instrument design, performance and operation and could provide a useful
              method for the analysis of industrially important materials.
