Abstract    :
              The understanding of the electrochemical behavior of structurally characterized
              diamond thin films is the focus of this research project.  With the support of
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professors John B.  Cooper and
              Sacharia Albin and their coworkers at Old Dominion University are using CVD
              methods to grow diamond thin films.  These films, characterized using scanning
              tunelling microscopy and other spectroscopic methods, are used to investigate
              the relationship between surface structure and inner and outer sphere electron
              transfer reactions.  Chemical modification of the diamond surface is carried
              out using covalently bound molecular species, and the effect of this
              modification on the electrochemical behavior explored.  

Diamond thin films
              have promising applications in electrochemical and materials science systems. 
              With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professors
              Cooper and Albin are exploring the connection between the structure of these
              films and their electrochemical properties.  A series of probe reactions are
              being examined, for a range of carefully characterized diamond thin film
              materials.  The information obtained from these studies will be very useful in
              developing improved and longer lasting electrocatalytic and sensor devices.
