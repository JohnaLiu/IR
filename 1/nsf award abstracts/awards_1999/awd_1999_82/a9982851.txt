              and World-wide high performance network distribution of bioinformatics data.

              
Summary
 
A central focus of bioinformatics is the large and rapidly
              growing knowledge of the genetic code of life. Human, Plant and Model Organism
              Genome Projects and related international efforts are on track with a full
              unraveling of this code, resulting in a flood of important data to
              bioscientists. The Internet is already the primary means for distributing this
              data. As it is growing to tens of gigabytes, and rapid increase in use of the
              Internet has introduced delays, a need
Has emerged for use of high performance
              network methods to speed its distribution.To help address this need, this
              project supports IUBio Archive and Bio-Mirrors, centered at Indiana University
              with international partners, for high speed, world-wide distribution of genome
              data.The IUBio Archive has a ten year record of providing public access to
              molecular biology data and software and serves a worldwide community of
              bioscientists A Bio-Mirror project has been initiated with international
              collaborators to provide rapid public access to and exchange of genome data.
              Bioinformatics centers in Japan, Australia, Singapore, China and Korea are
              currently involved with Bio-Mirrors. This award will support the addition of
              computer equipment to increase the stability and capability of the project.
