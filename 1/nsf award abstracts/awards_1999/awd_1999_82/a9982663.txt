Abstract    :
              	Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant fat in the membranes that
              surround mammalian cells.  This fat is absolutely essential for cell survival,
              as cells that cannot make PC are rapidly induced to undergo programmed cell
              death.  Therefore, it is important for cells to maintain relatively constant
              levels of PC in their membranes.  This is achieved through "homeostasis", a
              balance between the synthesis and degradation of PC.  Many lines of evidence
              indicate that the synthesis of PC is controlled by a specific enzyme, CT.  This
              research group has demonstrated that the degradation of PC may also be
              controlled by a specific enzyme, iPLA2.  Therefore, experiments will be
              performed to determine if changes in the amount of PC in cell membranes induce
              compensatory changes in the amount of iPLA2 in mammalian cells.  If this is the
              case, then the mechanism of the induction will be examined.  Together, these
              studies should provide insight into a basic aspect of cell biology, the
              mechanisms that cells use to maintain their membranes.
