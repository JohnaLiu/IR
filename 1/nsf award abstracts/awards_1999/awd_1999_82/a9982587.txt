Abstract    :
              With this award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program renews its
              support for the work of Dr. William R. Dolbier of the Department of Chemistry
              at the University of Florida in Gainesville.   The major purpose of the work is
              to build on the discoveries made with earlier NSF funding in the physical
              organic chemistry of organic molecules containing fluorine, and to develop
              applications in the areas of organic synthesis, industrial polymers, and
              biochemistry.   Dr. Dolbier will also be investigating the reactions of
              distonic radical cations, species with an unpaired electron and a positive
              electrical charge on different atoms in the same molecule.   The combination of
              synthesis, kinetic and mechanistic studies, and theoretical chemistry will
              provide excellent training for the postdoctoral and graduate students who will
              work on the project.   It should be mentioned that Dr. Dolbier was this year's
              winner of the ACS Award for Creative Work in Fluorine Chemistry.

The work
              falls into four general radical reaction classes: C-H transfer, cyclizations,
              cyclopropylcarbinyl ring opening, and reactions of distonic radical cations.  
              Both relative and absolute rate constants are measured after generating the
              radicals by fast flash photolysis - developing useful correlations between
              structure and reactivity that can be used to make predictions for molecules
              where the kinetic data are unavailable.
