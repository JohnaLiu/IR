Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, uses near and far field microscopic methods, coupled with single
              molecule spectrosocpy, to quantify the environmental origin of single molecule
              fluctuations in the spectroscopy of probe molecules in membrane systems. 
              Systematic studies of single molecule emission fluctuations in a series of
              highly ordered and well characterized lipid monolayers and bilayers are used to
              develop a set of single molecule probes that are used to obtain structural
              information about membrane systems.  Professor Robert Dunn and his
              collaborators at the University of Kansas are developing this approach to
              provide information about membrane systems containing cholesterol and lung
              surfactant proteins.  

In order to understand the functioning of cell
              membranes and related biological systems, detailed structural information must
              be obtained in the environment in which the membrane operates.  By coupling
              near and far-field microscopic methods with studies of probe molecule emission
              fluctuations, Professor Dunn and his coworkers at the University of Kansas are
              developing structural probes that can provide this information.   A systematic
              investigation of probe molecule fluctuations in a series of highly ordered
              model membranes is used to develop this probe methodology.
