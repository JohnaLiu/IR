Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to enable information retrieval systems to handle
              speech-based information by considerably enhancing speech recognition
              technology.   The PI's approach is to align collections of stories from text
              and speech sources in multiple languages, and to develop methods which exploit
              the resulting parallelism.   The PI will improve acoustic and language models,
              and will develop iterative recognition methods to facilitate capture of
              cross-lingual information resident in text and speech.  Voice-of-America
              broadcasts in English, Greek, and a third language to be determined, will
              provide the data source for this research.
