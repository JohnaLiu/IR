This award supports a 2-year collaborative research project
              between Dr. Donald G. Truhlar, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis and
              Professor Yongho Kim, Kyung Hee University, Korea.  The proposed collaboration
              aims to conduct multiconfiguration molecular mechanics studies for hydron
              transfer in large molecular systems using variational transition state theory
              including multidimensional semiclassical tunneling approximations.

The PIs
              plan to develop a robust algorithm for generating global potential energy
              surfaces of reactive systems in the field of chemistry and biochemistry.  The
              proposal is concerned with modeling the transition structure region using
              diabatic potentials from force field methods, together with an interaction term
              computed from more accurate quantum chemistry methods.  The method used in this
              research will be extended to a larger reactive system, such as the hydride
              transfer in alcohol dehydrogenase and the proton relay system in serine
              proteases.

This project will be performed in conjunction with Professor
              Kim's group at Korea under the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program.   This
              project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science
              Program, which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and
              Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information,
              ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual
              benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science and
              Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
