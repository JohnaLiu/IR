Many plant species possess genetic self-incompatibility
              (SI) systems whereby fertilization by self-pollen is prevented. This allows
              plants to avoid the deleterious effects of inbreeding but may reduce seed
              production when cross pollen is unavailable. Previous studies have shown that
              bellflowers (Campanula rapunculoides) are SI when they first open but become
              more self-compatible as the flowers' age. In short, bellflowers have low levels
              of inbreeding when cross-pollen is available and high seed production when it
              is not. This research examines the molecular, genetic, and ecological causes of
              this age dependent breakdown in SI. The first project will isolate, clone, and
              sequence the DNA that specifies SI (S-locus). The second will quantify the
              amount of inbreeding depression that is due to genes that are closely linked to
              the S-locus. The third examines the fitness of plants with strong and weak SI
              in two environments.

These projects will provide insights into (a) the
              mechanism by which self-pollen is recognized and rejected by flowers, (b the
              origin, maintenance and evolution of the S-locus, and (c) the relationship
              between fitness and the breeding system. These basic findings should also
              assist plant breeders, conservation ecologists, and those interested in the
              escape of genes from genetically modified organisms.
