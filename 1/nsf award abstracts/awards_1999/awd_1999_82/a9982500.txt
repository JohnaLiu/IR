Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will enable the Department of Chemistry at East Tennessee State
              University to purchase a 300 MHz fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance
              (FT-NMR) spectrometer.  This equipment will be used primarily by junior faculty
              member Tammy A. Davidson, whose research focuses on the design and synthesis of
              chiral polymeric surfactants to be used as stabilizers for hybrid water/hexane
              and water/carbon dioxide solvent systems.  These chiral surfactants have the
              potential to induce a chiral reaction medium for both organic synthesis and
              formation of polymers.  

NMR spectroscopy is a primary method of analysis of
              polymer structure.  Dr. Davidson will also utilize NMR spectroscopy in both the
              undergraduate organic chemistry courses and in an undergraduate/graduate (MS)
              course on polymer synthesis.
