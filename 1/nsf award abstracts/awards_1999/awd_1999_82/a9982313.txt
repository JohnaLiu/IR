This project addresses the
              question of how the brain controls the sequential order of behavior (i.e.,
              action syntax).  The basal ganglia play an important role in coordinating the
              serial order of behavior.  How
this is done will be studied via a
              neuroethological approach, which uses natural behavioral patterns, combined
              with neural manipulations, to reveal brain functions.

Our previous studies
              showed that the neostriatum implements specific patterns of serial order,
              involved in rodent grooming behavior.  A goal of this project is to better
              understand the role of neostriatal dopamine
systems in grooming syntax, and
              the localization of substrates that produce sequential super-stereotypy of
              patterns.  The ability of dopamine agonist microinjections to enhance specific
              patterns of action will be
compared across two neuroanatomical sites within
              the basal ganglia (substantia nigra and dorsal neostriatum).

The results of
              these experiments will improve our knowledge of how natural behavior results
              from normal brain function.  In addition, a clear understanding of the origin
              and maintenance of grooming behavior is likely to impact our understanding of
              other syntactically-timed behaviors, including human language.
