Unique biogeographic patterns and life history traits of
              periodical cicadas  have brought about extraordinary speciation events and
              species relationships.  Each synchronized periodical cicada emergence was
              thought to contain up to three species: 13-year Magicicada tredecim, Magicicada
              tredecassini and Magicicada tredecula; or 17-year Magicicada septendecim,
              Magicicada cassini, and Magicicada septendecula.  Our genetic, biogeographical
              and behavioral research led to the 1998 discovery of a new species with a
              13-year life cycle, Magicicada neotredecim.  This new species appears to have
              originated from a similar species with a 17- year life cycle.  Magicicada
              neotredecim is divided into two major geographic groups that emerge in
              different years; thus, although Magicicada neotredecim last emerged in 1998,
              another population will emerge in 2002.  During the next emergence, species
              distributions will be mapped, samples for genetic analysis obtained, the
              potential for interbreeding assessed, and the effect of interspecific
              interactions on mating behaviors evaluated.

Study of Magicicada neotredecim
              and its interactions with other similar species provides valuable information
              about this unique species complex, the mechanisms by which life cycles change,
              and the ways in which populations of the same life cycle become asynchronous. 
              The understanding of these mechanisms will provide general insights into the
              speciation process and the maintenance of species boundaries, both important
              foci of modern evolutionary biology.
