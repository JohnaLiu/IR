Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program will enable the Department of Chemistry at Louisiana State University
              and A&M College to purchase a differential scanning calorimeter.  This
              equipment will be used primarily by junior faculty member Vincent J. LiCata,
              whose research focuses on studies of DNA polymerases.  He will carry out
              parallel quantitative measurements of the thermodynamics of unfolding of four
              DNA polymerases from bacteria.  In addition, Dr. LiCata will measure the pH,
              water activity, and ionic dependencies of unfolding of these polymerases. 
              

This project will provide the first calorimetric determinations of the
              stability of any of these polymerases.  One of the polymerases Dr. LiCata will
              study remains almost completely uncharacterized biophysically, yet it is the
              most commonly used polymerase in polymerase chain reaction, or PCR.   PCR
              enables scientists to mass-produce DNA molecules from incredibly small amounts
              of material; thus it is useful to a wide range of scientists, from forensic
              scientists to those working on the human genome project.
