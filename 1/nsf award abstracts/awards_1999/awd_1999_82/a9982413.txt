It is
              proposed to extend Professor Davis' ongoing research on micron-sized aerosol
              measurement by means of Raman derived spectroscopic techniques, supplemented by
              the electrodynamic trapping in space of the particulates of interest
              (electrodynamic balance).  Three tasks are proposed:
1) The exploration of
              aerosol sizes in the submicron range (typical of organic and bioaerosol
              materials); resonant Raman techniques will be emphasized in this part.  It is
              hoped that atmospheric specie will respond to the use of tunable ultra violet
              sources in the latter technique.
2) The specific problem of ultra violet
              induced fluorescence as a contaminant of the Raman signals, will be alleviated
              by substituting a near-infra-red source.  A tunable dye laser (700-800nm) will
              also be tested for it's suitably in getting clear Raman spectra.
3) This
              technique (electrodynamic balance + Raman) will be applied to investigate the
              desulfurization process in power plants stack gases.

Some of the processes
              occurring in electrodynamic balance trapping (e.g. charging) stand in the way
              of the accuracy necessary to measure the kind of submicrometer particles found
              in the atmosphere.  Also, the procedure has been tailored so far to relatively
              simplified laboratory conditions.  It will be further refined to allow for
              direct "on-line" environment measurements.
