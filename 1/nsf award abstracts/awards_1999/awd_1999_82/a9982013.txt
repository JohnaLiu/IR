Abstract    :
              This project will investigate how the Raramuri (Tarahumara) Indians of
              Chihuahua, Mexico use music to produce and define ethnic groupings and
              identities. The Raramuri show little evidence of cultural cohesion as Raramuri,
              but instead define themselves as members of highly fluid local communities.
              Tourism is placing increasing stress on local definitions of a cohesive ethnic
              identity, and the researcher argues that music is the vehicle through which
              that cohesion/definition is achieved. The researcher will investigate how music
              helps to define identity by "enacting social constructions of space and time."
              The project will focus on the production of violin music at three sites.
