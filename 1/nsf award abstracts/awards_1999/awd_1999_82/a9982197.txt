Abstract    :
              Calculational studies of the elementary steps of electrocatalysis form the focus
              of this research project supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program.  Professor Alfred B.  Anderson's research group at Case Western
              applies ab initio quantum mechanical calculations to the study of electron and
              proton transfer at the electrochemical interface.  Density functional
              correlation corrected methods are used to examine the four electron reduction
              of oxygen to water and the oxidation of CO by water and hydroxyl at the
              platinum electrode surface.  The electrode potential dependence of the
              fundamental reaction steps is emphasized, and comparisons with experimental
              studies carried out by collaborators at Case Western are included.

In order
              to understand the detailed microscopic mechanism of electrode reactions
              important to electrocatalysis and fuel cell design, quantum chemical
              calculations are used to determine the kinetic and energetic pathways for
              molecular processes on the electrode surface.  This project, supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses these questions of
              microscopic reaction mechanism.  Professor Anderson's group at Case Western
              examines the reduction of oxygen and the oxidation of CO as important model
              systems for these electrocatalytic processes.  Information from these studies
              will be useful in the design and engineering of fuel cell and electrocatalytic
              systems.
