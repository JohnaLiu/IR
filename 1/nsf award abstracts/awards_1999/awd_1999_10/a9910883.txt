In this project, the PIs will investigate the transport of
              sediments within the wave boundary layer (WBL).  A numerical solution to the
              Navier-Stokes equations will be applied to the dynamics of the WBL generated by
              oscillating currents induced by surface gravity waves over the bottom.  Both
              flat and corrugated bottoms will be considered (the latter to simulate sand
              ripples).  For small to intermediate Reynolds number, the equations will be
              solved directly, while for larger Reynolds numbers, a Large Eddy Simulation
              approach will be used.
