The genetics and biology of species in the genus
              Drosophila are the most completely characterized of any group of organisms. 
              The relative ease and rapidity with which large numbers of Drosophila are
              reared in the laboratory continue to make species of this genus
attractive for
              a wide range of investigations.  A major facilitator of this research effort
              has been the Drosophila Species Stock Center, presently housed at Bowling Green
              State University.  The Species Stock Center contains approximately 1400
              cultures representing 265 species and 33 species groups.

This award will
              support the move of  the Species Stock Center to the University of Arizona, a
              Research One institution with 13 faculty whose research is focused upon
              Drosophila.  The administrative home of the collection will be within the
              Insect Science Center, also directed by the PI.  With the support provided, the
              collection's current holdings will be reviewed in the context of community use
              and needs, a new and informative web site will be created, public workshops
              will be offered, a DNA collection will be developed, and visits to the center
              by other investigators will be facilitated.  In addition to the rich scientific
              environment provided by the Center for Insect Science and the University of
              Arizona, the institution will commit strong support for the Drosophila Species
              Stock Center in the form of personnel, equipment, space and renovations, and
              support for investigators to attend the workshops and visit the Stock Center.
