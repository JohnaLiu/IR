Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project examines contestation over the health claims
              made by workers and community members in Silicon Valley located in Santa Clara
              County, California. The aim of this research is to examine the diverse and
              often contradictory claims made by key interest groups through an analysis of
              knowledge production and claimsmaking practices. The research focuses on the
              cultural, social, and political conflicts in the identification, measurement,
              and treatment of toxic contamination in the workplace and in the surrounding
              communities. The research design employs a variety of qualitative methodologies
              to conduct a "multisite ethnography." Methodologies for this study include:
              in-depth interviews,both structured and informal, participant observation,
              archival research, and content analysis. The data will be organized by using a
              social worlds framework which examines the interaction between all key
              individuals and social groups active around the specific arena in question.
              Methods of analysis include techniques of grounded theory, in which research
              questions are modified as data collection and analysis are conducted.
