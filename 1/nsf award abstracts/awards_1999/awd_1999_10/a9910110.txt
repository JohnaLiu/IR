Zlateva
This award supports Stoyanka Zlateva and two students from
              Boston University in a collaboration with Kurt Rothermel from the Institute for
              Parallel and Distributed High Performance Systems at the University of
              Stuttgart, Germany.  The project will focus on making use of the highly
              heterogeneous systems that result from the large variety of software and
              hardware components that are now being connected via high-speed links in
              today's networks.  One result of the research will be a novel two-stage remote
              evaluation model for active distributed computing, which will make it possible
              to distribute computation over a network consisting of highly heterogeneous
              components.  Another will be security mechanisms and performance models for
              mobile agents.
