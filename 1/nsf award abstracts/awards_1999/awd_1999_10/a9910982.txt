A team of social science and
              natural science researchers plans to apply the techniques of tree-ring analysis
              to the dating of wood samples recovered from Inuit sod houses in archaeological
              sites in coastal Labrador, Canada. The dates derived from structural components
              of sod houses will help archaeologists more accurately determine when sites
              were occupied and certain house forms were in use. There is a pressing need to
              date precisely Labrador Inuit sod houses and middens in order to develop more
              robust theories concerning the factors that resulted in major and repeated
              subsistence and settlement changes in the last 700 years of Labrador Inuit
              history. Tree-ring dating offers archaeologists in Labrador a unique
              opportunity to map the culture history with more precision and to develop and
              test theories about the conjunction of culture, history, and environment.
