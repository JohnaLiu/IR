Abstract    :
              The U.S. Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (U.S. GLOBEC) program has the goal of
              understanding and ultimately predicting how populations of marine animal
              species respond to natural and anthropogenic changes in climate.   Research in
              the Southern Ocean (SO) indicates strong coupling between climatic processes
              and ecosystem dynamics via the annual formation and destruction of sea ice. 
              The Southern Ocean GLOBEC Program (SO GLOBEC) will investigate the dynamic
              relationship between physical processes and ecosystem responses through
              identification of critical parameters that affect the distribution, abundance
              and population dynamics of target species.  The overall goals of the SO GLOBEC
              program are to elucidate shelf circulation processes and their effect on sea
              ice formation and krill distribution, and to examine the factors which govern
              krill survivorship and availability to higher trophic levels,  including
              penguins, seals and whales. The focus of the U.S. contribution to the
              international SO GLOBEC program will be on winter processes. This component
              will focus on the distribution and activities of sea ice microbial communities.
              This will be accomplished using an integrated combination of sampling (vertical
              profiles, horizontal surveys, and under-ice surveys) and observational
              protocols. Experiments will be designed to estimate microbial activity within
              the sea ice and at the ice-seawater interface. The research will be coordinated
              with components studying the water column productivity and the sea ice habitat.
              The result of the integrated SO GLOBEC program will be to improve the
              predictability of living marine resources, especially with respect to local and
              global climatic shifts.
