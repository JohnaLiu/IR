This award supports Joseph Hamilton and two students from
              Vanderbilt University in a collaboration with Walter Greiner of the Department
              of Theoretical Physics at the U. of Frankfurt, Germany.  The project will focus
              on understanding the mechanisms of cold (neutronless) fragmentation of nuclei. 
              The collaboration brings together the experimental expertise and facilities on
              the U.S. side with the theoretical capabilities of the German side.  Recently,
              new facilities (namely, large germanium arrays such as Gammasphere and Eurogram
              II) have made detailed spectroscopic studies of neutron-rich nuclei possible,
              resulting of observation in new structural features.  This in turn has led to
              some entirely new approaches to the study of fission.  The collaboration
              supported here will bring together experimentalists and theorists in a way that
              will significantly advance the field of nuclear fission.
