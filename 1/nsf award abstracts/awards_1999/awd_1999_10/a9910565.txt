Abstract    :
              This award will provide funding and logistical support to continue the operation
              of very low frequency (VLF) radio receivers at Palmer Station Antarctica.  The
              receivers detect impulsive signals (sferics) from thunderstorms, longer,
              frequency-dispersed, signals (whistlers) that come from electromagnetic waves
              that thunderstorms launch into the Earth's magnetosphere and thunderstorm
              induced perturbations in transmitted VLF signals.  This last capability permits
              the location of thunderstorms to be determined by triangulation using several
              VLF transmitters in different parts of the US.  The experimenters are working
              in collaboration with colleagues who have similar receivers at Commandante
              Ferraz Station (Brazil) and Rothera Station (UK) in Antarctica.  The network of
              receiving sites coupled with the distributed transmitters in the US provides
              powerful tools to determine the location and characteristics of thunderstorms
              over much of the globe.  Stanford University has been a leader in VLF research
              for many years
