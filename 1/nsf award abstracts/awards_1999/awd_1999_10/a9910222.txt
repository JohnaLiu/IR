Abstract    :
              
Conference Proposal: Global and Regional Sea-Level Changes and the
              Hydrological Cycle

October 4-7, 1999 Loiri-Porto San Paolo, Sardinia,
              Italy

The objective of this conference is to provide a forum for critical
              discussion of the present state of knowledge of sea-level variability in
              relation to the hydrological cycle both at global and regional scales.  The
              main focus will be on the identification of problem areas which need to be
              investigated and key parameters which need to be monitored in order to improve
              our understanding of the physical phenomena and their interactions governing
              the spatial and temporal variations of sea level.
