The Liberty Science  Center is conducting a one-day symposium
              to be held immediately prior to the annual meeting of the Giant Screen Theater
              Association.  The purpose of the symposium is to bring together large format
              film producers, distributors, and theater owners to reflect on the educational
              aspects and the presentation of science in the large format film medium. 
              Presenters will include producers, science educators and researchers/evaluators
              who have worked in the medium.
