Abstract    :
              This program will utilize the dynamic renormalization group formalism to study
              the turbulence structures in the Earth's magnetotail.  Turbulence in non-linear
              systems may lead to self-organized criticality, which may explain such
              phenomena as bursty bulk flows and substorm phenomena.  The model will be based
              on renormalization group theory for systems far from equilibrium.  In addition
              to the purely theoretical studies, self-consistent numerical simulations will
              be carried out.  Emphasis will be placed on the sporadic and localized
              fluctuations of the magnetotail
