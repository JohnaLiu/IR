"Science and Civil Society:  Historical Perspectives"

This award supports
              a two-day, workshop-style conference devoted to "Science and Civil Society:
              Historical Perspectives," to be held April 14-15, 2000, at the University of
              Wisconsin Madison. The aim of this conference is to explore the varieties of
              relationships formed between science and civil society, at both the conceptual
              and institutional levels, since the late seventeenth century. By bringing
              together scholars with different national perspectives and historiographic
              traditions to confront what we mean by "science" and "civil society," and to
              examine how these entities have interacted in historically specific cases, we
              expect this conference to move us toward a broader understanding of the place
              of science in the construction of the modern world. The conference will serve
              as the basis for the 2002 issue of the History of Science Society's annual
              volume Osiris, the proposal for which has already been accepted.
