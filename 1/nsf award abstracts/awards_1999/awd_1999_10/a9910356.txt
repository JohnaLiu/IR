Vitreoscilla produces hemoglobin that displays an unusually
              high rate of oxygen dissociation.  Although the function of VHb in its natural
              host is not known, evidence suggests that it facilitates respiration under
              hypoxic conditions by funneling oxygen to the terminal oxidases.  Biophysical
              characteristics and oxygen binding properties of selected mutants of VHb will
              be analyzed. The crystal structure of hemoglobin (VHb) obtained from the
              aerobic bacterium Vitreoscilla is available thus facilitating this research.
              These studies will help assess whether predicted structural changes from each
              of the site-directed mutations have occurred and how changes in the oxygen
              binding affinity alter respiratory activity and oxygen metabolism of microbial
              systems.  VHb function in the native organism will be evaluated also using a
              vgb (gene) knockout mutation (to eliminate VHb) to determine the role of VHb on
              growth, respiration and ATP synthesis, especially under hypoxic conditions.
