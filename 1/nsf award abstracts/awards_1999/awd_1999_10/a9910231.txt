Abstract    :
              This award to the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans
              in Science (SACNAS) enables that organization to recruit approximately 100
              Native American and Latino undergraduate and graduate students from the
              non-biomedical sciences to participate in the 1999 SACNAS National Conference
              to be held in Portland, OR on October 7-10, 1999.  At the conference, these
              students will present results of research activities in which they have been
              involved and also attend mentoring sessions designed to assist them in planning
              for subsequent educational and employment pursuits.  Additionally, a day-long
              session is planned in which NSF staff will describe opportunities for
              Foundation support of research and education activities.

Historically,
              SACNAS national conferences have focussed on students with biomedical
              backgrounds and interests, primarily because financial support for these
              conferences has been provided largely by the National Institutes of Health.  In
              FY 1998, NSF provided support to SACNAS to broaden the disciplinary perspective
              of the conference to include those disciplines that are reflected in the
              investment portfolios of NSF.  This renewal award provides support to continue
              that broadening process.  Short-term goals of this activity include a marked
              increase in the number of SACNAS conference student attendees with interests in
              the non-biomedical sciences and engineering.  In the longer term, increases in
              Latino and Native Americans in NSF-relevant science and engineering activities
              are expected. 

This award is jointly supported by the Directorates for
              Biological Sciences; Computer and Information Science and Engineering;
              Education and Human Resources; Geosciences; Mathematical and Physical Sciences;
              Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; and the NSF Office of Integrative
              Activities.
