Abstract    :
              This project will investigate how cooperation is achieved and maintained by
              examining "norms of pro-social beliefs and punishment" among the Hmong (Laos)
              and Chaldean (Iraq) populations of Detroit. It argues that because cooperation
              (reciprocal altruism) varies extensively cross-culturally, that culture must
              play a major role in shaping pro-social norms. Culturally transmitted beliefs
              (norms) concerning pro-sociality maintain cooperation among large groups of
              unrelated individuals despite the evolutionary expectation that "free-riders"
              will undermine the viability of the group. The two migrant groups chosen for
              the study differ significantly in their cultural patterns of cooperation. The
              research is framed within theories of economic/evolutionary ecology.
