Abstract    :
              This workshop is intended to bring together a group of researchers to discuss
              and recommend future directions in the field of source-channel
              coding.
Specifically, the goals of the workshop are:
Provide a contextual
              basis for understanding the array of applications in which source-channel
              coding can play a central role;
Assess the potential impact of source-channel
              coding technology in those applications;
Identify and characterize the major
              research issues associated with the design, development, and deployment of
              source-channel coding technology;
Develop a conceptual framework for future
              crosscutting research activities in this inherently interdisciplinary area.
