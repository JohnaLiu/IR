This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              electrical and communication systems involves Andrew R. Teel and Petar
              Kokotovic of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Antonio Loria of
              the Laboratoire d'Automatique de Grenoble.  The project, supported under a
              program of the National Science Foundation and the French National Center for
              Scientific Research (CNRS), will facilitate the development of new uniform
              stability analysis tools for time-varying systems and robust control design
              following a passivity approach.  In particular the investigators will focus on
              control laws for tracking control and time-varying stabilization of nonlinear
              nonautonomous systems (NLTV).  In parallel to their theoretical study, the
              investigators will apply the new theorems to particular problems such as
              tracking control of electromechanical systems, under actuated manipulators, and
              autonomous vehicles.

The project takes advantage of U.S. and French
              complementary expertise in the techniques used in the field of nonlinear
              control.  Their joint efforts will advance understanding of adaptive control of
              time-varying systems when the unknown parameters appear nonlinearly in the
              dynamics.
