This three-year award supports US-France cooperative
              research in applied mathematics between Stephen Wiggins of the California
              Institute of Technology and Laurent Wiesenfeld of the Laboratoire de
              Spectrometrie Physique at the University of Grenoble.  The objective of their
              research is to study molecular vibrations at high energies.  Their mathematical
              approach to this problem involves the geometrical theory of dynamical systems
              and Hamiltonian mathematics.

The US investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise in Hamiltonian mathematics.  This is complemented by
              French expertise in geometric theory and chemical physics.  The project will
              further understanding of vibrational dynamics of highly excited molecules, a
              problem at the forefront of research in chemical physics.
