Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to initiate a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Maine's Darling Marine
              Center.  The two-year pilot program will sponsor six to eight undergraduate
              students in an eleven-week internship that includes seminars and a research
              project. Mentors chosen by the students will help the students formulate and
              conduct a research project.  Students will receive instruction in scientific
              methodology and related skills that are common to all fields of science
              (hypothesis formulation and testing, elementary statistics, experimental and
              sampling design, scientific writing, and data presentation). They will also
              participate in a seminar focussed on careers in marine science and will present
              results of their research at the end of the program. The program is open to all
              U.S. citizens and permanent residents attending any college or university.
              Applications from women and under-represented minorities are particularly
              encouraged. Matching funds from the University of Maine are also included in
              this proposal.
