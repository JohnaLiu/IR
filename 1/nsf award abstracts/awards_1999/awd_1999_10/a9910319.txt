Abstract    :
              The proposed research would test the feasibility of a long term observatory in
              the Bering Strait region of Alaska.  The key facility would be a pumping
              station located on Little Diomede Island in the center of the Strait.  Seawater
              from depth would be pumped to a laboratory on shore in which the waters'
              physical, biological, and chemical composition would be determined by automated
              instrumentation and from samples collected manually.  These results would be
              compared to and used in relation to long-term data on water flows through the
              Strait, and thus could potentially supply important information about inputs of
              biota and seawaters into the Arctic.  Additional data would be collected
              concerning the abundance of macrobenthic animals found in richer sediments both
              north and south of the Strait.  Marine mammals collected by the local village
              would be examined and catalogued as part of the long-term records for the site.
