Abstract    :
              The investigators will conduct a suite of genetic studies aimed at increasing
              fundamental knowledge of gene flow and molecular systematics of organisms
              associated with mid-ocean ridge systems and cognate environments in the deep
              sea.  Over the past decade, the investigators have amassed an extensive
              collection of specimens from fast-, intermediate-, and slow-spreading systems
              throughout the world's oceans.  The primary objectives of this project are to
              extend ongoing studies of gene flow, genetic diversity, and evolutionary
              relationships to samples recently collected from the southern East Pacific Rise
              (7 degrees S - 32 degrees S latitude) and to continue studies of evolutionary
              relationships and biogeography of deep-sea hydrothermal vent and sulfide seep
              organisms throughout the world.  In particular, the investigators will search
              for evidence of connections between the southern East Pacific Rise, the central
              Indian ridge system, and western Pacific back arc basins.  Preliminary data
              indicate that there are several "morphospecies" at 31 degrees - 32 degrees S
              that may be related to, or conspecific with, named species for the western
              Pacific (Lau and Manus Back Arc Basins and Mariana Trough).  This project
              should provide a comprehensive picture of ecological, geological, and
              evolutionary processes affecting the dominant invertebrate species that live in
              some of the most extreme environments on our planet.  The biodiversity aspects
              of this research have been recognized with a supplementary award (NIH) to
              facilitate materials and technology transfer to parties interested in marine
              natural products discovery.
