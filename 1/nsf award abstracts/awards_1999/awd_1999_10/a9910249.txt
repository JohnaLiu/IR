This grant provides partial support for the costs of
              upgrading the Rutgers University Electron Microprobe (EMP) Facility in the
              Department of Geological Sciences.  Matching funds secured through the NASA
              Cosmochemistry program will combine with funds from this grant to upgrade the
              1987 vintage JEOL JXA-8600 Superprobe from its present DEC PDP 11-based
              computer control system to a PC-based system running Windows NT.  A modern
              PC-based automation system will be capable of integrated wavelength dispersive
              and energy dispersive spectroscopy and backscattered electron imaging and will
              dramatically extend the useful life and capabilities of a still viable EMP. 
              The EMP will be used in continuing microanalytical studies of achondritic
              meteorites, volcanic glasses and high pressure experimental charges by faculty
              at Rutgers including Jeremy Delaney, Roger Hewins and Claude Herzberg.  In
              addition, the EMP will facilitate studies by regional geoscientists from Bryn
              Mawr and West Chester Universities.
