Abstract    :
              A large amount of past research has examined how people respond to traumatic
              life experiences. However, little is known about how cognitive, social, and
              emotional responses to trauma interact and develop over time. In addition, very
              few studies have looked at how adolescents cope with traumatic events, and
              almost no research has investigated the similarities and differences among
              family members who are experiencing the same traumatic event. The recent
              Littleton, Colorado school shooting offers a compelling and important context
              in which to study these issues. The goal of this small grant for exploratory
              research is to document the variability in acute responses to a community
              trauma among both adolescents and adults, in an effort to identify early
              predictors of long-term adjustment to trauma. Residents of the Littleton
              community will be interviewed immediately, with follow-up assessments to occur
              6 months and 18 months later. Results from this study will have both
              theoretical and practical utility in understanding the psychological aftermath
              of human-made as well as natural disasters.
