Citing the dearth of models of what works in terms of
              integrating assessment reforms into a curriculum, this project will develop a
              set of "progress variables" that mediate between the specific detail in
              assessments associated with particular curricula and the more general contents
              of Standards documents.  These progress variables will permit teachers to track
              student progress through a particular curriculum.  Calibrated scale maps that
              map student growth will be developed.  The purpose of the planning grant is to
              demonstrate the feasibility of the transfer of the BEAR Assessment System
              (developed for SEPUP's "Issues Evidence and You") to two middle school FOSS
              units.
