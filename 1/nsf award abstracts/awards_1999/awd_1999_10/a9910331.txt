Abstract    :
              Measurements of the sea-ice penetration depth below the sea surface (ice draft)
              have been made by U.S. submarines operating in the Arctic Ocean since 1958. 
              These Arctic records will be obtained from the U.S. Navy,  transcribed and
              analyzed, and placed in the public record.   The data will be used to examine
              regional and seasonal changes in the ice thickness over the Arctic basin. 
              Expectations are that the ice pack has become thinner over the last several
              decades.  Long-term trends will be examined in collaboration with other
              scientists with more recent data and with data from other countries.
