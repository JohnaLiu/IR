The objective is to develop particle
              technology education in the core undergraduate laboratory courses of chemical
              and mechanical engineering at NJIT, and provide reference materials to other
              universities and industrial sites.  The outcomes from a Combined Research
              Curriculum Development (CRCD) project, the experience gained in both
              departments, and two major industrial partners (Malvern Instruments and Dow
              Chemicals Co.) will be used for the preparation of several particle technology
              education modules based on new laboratory experiments, multimedia and internet
              resources.   This course development will employ the experience gained with the
              CRCD project, the research results obtained in the two departments, and
              industry participation.  The development of a 'virtual particle technology
              laboratory' is envisioned in longer term.  The industrial partners will
              contribute to the education approach and help with its dissemination.  An
              industry advisory board will be established.  The chemical and mechanical
              engineering departments will make available courses with a total of 125
              undergraduate students per year for this education experiment, provide
              laboratory support, and release time (25% of the academic year) for the P.I.
