Abstract    :
              9910336

This three-year award supports US-Spain cooperative research in
              applied mathematics between Stephen Wiggins of the California Institute of
              Technology and Amadeu Delshams at the Polytechnic University of Catalunya and
              Angel Jorba at the University of Barcelona.  The objective of their research is
              to develop computational and analytical techniques to study classical and
              semi-classical dynamics of molecules with three or more degrees of
              freedom.

The Spanish group has lead in the development of numerical methods
              for the study of Hamiltonian systems, and the US PI is working with
              applications in theoretical chemistry.  This interdisciplinary research effort
              in dynamical systems and theoretical chemistry could play an important role in
              the interpretation of new experimental data and further development in the
              field of theoretical chemistry.
