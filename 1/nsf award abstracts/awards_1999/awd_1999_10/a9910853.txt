Title:
              Predictability and Variability of the Present Climate

The main objective of
              this grant research is to establish a scientific basis for, and to advance our
              understanding of the variability and predictability of the present climate
              using comprehensive and realistic models of the climate system.  The primary
              emphasis is to simulate, understand and demonstrate the predictability of
              seasonal-to-interannual climate variations using coupled models of the
              atmosphere, ocean and land system.  Understanding and predicting
              seasonal-to-interannual variability requires modeling and understanding
              variability on interdecadal time scales; therefore, the PIs will investigate
              some aspects of the decadal variability and predictability of climate.
