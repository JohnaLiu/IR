Abstract    :
              This project will collect meteorology and hydrology data from river systems that
              discharge into the Arctic Ocean.  The dataset will be used to develop an
              integrated system of discharge and meteorology data that will be available in
              near real-time on the world Wide Web.  The data set will provide a valuable
              resource for characterizing water budgets for an ocean that collects 10% of the
              global freshwater runoff.  The discharge data will be used in models to
              determine the temporal variations in runoff.  Those models are important for
              predicting the effect of global climate change on the freshwater balance of the
              Arctic Ocean which, in turn, has a major climate feedback through its influence
              on the formation of sea ice.
