The Antenna and Propagation Society and the Microwave Theory
              and Techniques Society of IEEE are proposing the cooperative sponsorship of an
              international forum for "young investigators" to present their research views
              and exchange ideas on establishing multidisciplinary research in the area of
              wireless information technology and networks. The goal is to stimulate
              international and multidisciplinary research and educational activities that
              will address the many technical challenges facing development of future
              generations of wireless systems, and ultimately support the successful
              implementation of this technology in a wide variety of applications including
              education, medicine, transportation, and communications.

The international
              forum will be held in conjunction with the International Symposium on Antennas
              and Propagation (ISAP 2000) in Japan. Attached is a copy of a draft of the
              conference announcement which will be modified to include a description of a
              special program for the "Young Investigators' International Forum". We propose
              that NSF provides travel expenses for up to 10 young investigators from the US
              to attend the ISAP conference, and it is expected that ISAP will waive the
              registration fee for the selected recipient of this NSF travel grants.
