"Methodological Issues
              in Cognitive Neuropsychology"

In collaboration with a post-doctoral
              assistant, the principal investigator will apply results and frameworks from
              philosophy of science and computer science to a group of methodological
              problems in cognitive neuropsychology. This work will result in (i) algorithmic
              characterizations of which mental processing models are indistinguishable on
              the basis of behavioral evidence of brain damaged subjects; (ii)
              characterizations of the reliability of inference to mental processing models
              from individual and aggregated (in various ways) data from the behavior of
              brain damaged subjects; (iii) characterizations of mathematically possible data
              sets and conditions on explanation under which lesioned neural nets cannot
              explain imagined normal and brain damaged behavior; and (iv) studies of
              strategies for using imaging and evoked response potential data for inferences
              to features of cognitive processing architecture.
