Abstract    :
              
This award renews funding of the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (BGSC) at the
              Ohio State University.  The BGSC acquires, maintains and distributes pure
              cultures of several species of Bacillus.  The center's collection includes 1400
              strains, many of these genetic variants or mutants useful in a variety of basic
              and applied research areas.  Both online and printed catalogues describing the
              content of the collection are available.  Approximately 1500 cultures are
              distributed each year to academic, government and industrial researchers in the
              US and abroad.  During the period funded by this award, a user fee will be
              instituted, and additional information on the contents of the collection and
              methods for use of the collected organisms will be made available online.
