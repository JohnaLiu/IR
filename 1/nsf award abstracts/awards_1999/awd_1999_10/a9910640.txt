Abstract    :
              This project supports the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) to be conducted
              during the period February-March 1999.  The principal  goal of INDOEX is to
              measure the direct and indirect effects of aerosol on the tropospheric
              radiative energy budget.  To support INDOEX, we propose to deploy the Advanced
              Microwave Imaging Radiometer (AIMR) on the NCAR C-130 research aircraft during
              its flights for INDOEX.  We plan to analyze the AIMR data for cloud liquid
              water path (vertically integrated amount of cloud liquid water) determined over
              the swath of the radiometer.  This dataset can also be used to determine
              rainfall rate and to estimate integrated water vapor path (precipitable water).
               This project supports INDOEX primary scientific objectives by providing
              information on gradients in the liquid water path of low-level clouds, to aid
              in the interpretation of the indirect effect of aerosols on the radiative
              fluxes.
