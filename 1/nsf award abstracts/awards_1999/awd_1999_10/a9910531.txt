This award supports a 3-year collaborative research
              project between Dr. Challapalli Suryanarayana, Colorado School of Mines, and
              Professor B. S. Chun, Chungham National University, Korea.   The proposed
              research aims to develop high-strength and wear-resistant nanocomposite Al-base
              alloys by rapid solidification processing.  Al-Si alloys have been
              traditionally used in the industries for wear resistance purposes because the
              high volume fraction of the Si phase imparts good wear resistance of the Si
              phase, and this can be achieved by rapid solidification processing (RSP)
              techniques.  

This project will be performed in conjunction with Professor
              Chun's group at Chungham National University, Korea under the U.S.-Korea
              Cooperative Science Program.   Excellent facilities exist for rapid
              solidification at the Chungnam National University in Taejon, Korea where rapid
              solidification processing (RSP) of Al-Si-base alloys will be conducted on a
              variety of Al-Si-based alloys containing transition metals like Fe, Cr, Zr, and
              Ni.  Aluminum alloys containing essentially Si and transition metals will be
              subjected to RSP and their microstructural and mechanical properties will be
              evaluated.  Attempts will also be made to test these alloys in an industrial
              environment.

This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea
              Cooperative Science Program, which seeks to increase the level of cooperation
              between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of
              scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration
              on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea
              Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
