Abstract    :
              The objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)project is to
              develop a universal framework for representing the frictional boundary
              conditions at the tool-chip interface in machining based on fractal theory. 
              Previous studies conducted using photomicrographs from literature provide
              justification for this approach.  Mathematical models developed in preliminary
              work will be validated and improved with real experimental data.  The fractal
              behavior of the tool-chip interface will be investigated, and the materials and
              cutting conditions leading to different fractal dimensions will be quantified. 
              These dimensions will be used to determine the shape, size, location and
              proportion of sliding/sticking islands at the interface, which will then be
              used to calculate contact area, cutting forces, total power expended, and
              cutting temperatures.  Comparison with traditional models will be conducted. 
              

This project has the potential of drawing new insight into the machining
              process and generating more accurate models of the process for the prediction
              of cutting forces, cutting temperatures, and tool wear.  If successful, it
              should benefit cutting tool design, coating material development, and machining
              parameter selection.
