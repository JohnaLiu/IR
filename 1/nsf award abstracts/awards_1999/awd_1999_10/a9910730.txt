Funds are provided for the statistical
              analysis of historical data sets of sea surface temperature, sea level height,
              sea ice extent, sea ice concentration, surface air temperature, sea level
              pressure, surface wind, temperature profiles, salinity profiles, and drifter
              velocities to better understand the structure of the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave
              (ACW), a recently described feature of the climate system.  In particular, the
              investigators will determine the depth to which the ACW signal occurs below the
              sea surface and its effect on the main pycnocline.  They will also determine
              the coherence between the ACW and sea ice concentration in the Weddell and Ross
              Seas.  This will assist in interpreting the potential role of the ACW in the
              formation of Antarctic Bottom Water.
