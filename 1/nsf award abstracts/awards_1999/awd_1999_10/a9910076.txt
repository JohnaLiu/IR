Abstract    :
              This project will explore the rational design and synthesis of paramagnetic
              transition metal complexes, which will be studied by a combination of
              electrochemistry, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and
              magnetometry.  Specific properties that will come under scrutiny include
              exchange coupling in organic biradicals, re-entrant magnetic properties,
              conformational J-modulation in the solid state, and stabilities of high-spin
              biradicals.  In a general sense, the relationship between the molecular
              structure and electronic properties of molecules that exhibit magnetism will be
              explored.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the research of Professor David A. Schultz of North Carolina State
              University.  Professor Schultz and coworkers willprepare new materials that
              will  demonstrate magnetic properties that are based on the design of the
              material's individual molecules.  Such materials could be integral for the
              refinement of molecular-leel information storage and retrieval devices and
              other subminiature electronic components for the 21st Century.   A strong
              undergraduate involvement in the research will provide an excellent training
              experience for potential new scientists.
