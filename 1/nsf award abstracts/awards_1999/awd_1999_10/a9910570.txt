This award supports twelve participants to attend a workshop
              and field demonstration in Iceland in August 1999.  The international workshop
              and demonstration of the Icelandic rift zones will provide marine scientists
              with first-hand knowledge of the physical terrain and geological processes that
              affect all rift systems.  Iceland is a subaerial section of the mid-ocean ridge
              system, and has many features and processes that are similar to those on the
              submarine mid-ocean ridge system.  Compared to the costs of putting a scientist
              on the bottom of the ocean in a submersible, field experience in Iceland is
              inexpensive.  The demonstration will be organized jointly by scientists from
              the University of Hawaii and the Nordic Volcanological Institute in Reykjavik. 
              The demonstration will encourage interaction between US and Icelandic
              scientists.
