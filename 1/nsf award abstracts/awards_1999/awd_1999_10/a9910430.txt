Abstract    :
              Charles Parmenter of Indiana University is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform experiments on vibrational
              and rotational energy transfer from large polyatomic molecules to atoms and
              diatomic molecules in the gas phase.  Laser pumping will be used to produce the
              internal excitation with state to state resolution while dispersed fluorescence
              will follow the important energy transfer channels.  The systems to be studied
              are: (1) collisions of laser aligned glyoxal and deuterated formaldehyde with
              hydrogen, helium and deuterium to investigate the effects of orientation; and
              (2) collisional activation/deactivation by gases such as argon of large
              molecules (p-difluorobenzene is a prime example) where there is enough internal
              energy for dissociation and isomerization to occur.  This latter study involves
              the determination of absolute reaction cross sections for highly excited
              molecules which has not previously been possible.

The proposed studies will
              have a major impact on our understanding of how energy is transferred from
              large molecules to other atoms and smaller molecules, especially the conversion
              of internal energy into energy of motion.  These sophisticated and very
              fundamental studies will determine the efficiency of the processes and how the
              energy transfer process is influenced by orientation.  They have relevance to
              highly excited species associated with atmospheric chemistry.
