As the application of computers to the physical world
              widen,  there is an ever increasing need for computational tools to deal  with
              the physical attributes of objects, such as their geometry.  The field of
              Computational Geometry has made impressive strides  in the last twenty years in
              providing an algorithmic foundation  for the solution to many geometric
              problems in computer graphics,  computer vision, robotics and manufacturing,
              and many other  application areas. The purpose of this proposal is to develop a
               set of novel geometric representations and algorithmic techniques  that will
              make computational geometry more useful in modeling  physical-world objects and
              processes. The aim is not to obtain  universal, domain-independent solutions
              --- such as a complete  solution to robustness concerns in geometric computing.
              Instead  the focus will be on certain key issues, such as scale-  sensitivity,
              shape variability, and motion, that arise in many of  the important uses of
              geometry in modeling physical objects and  systems. Geometric models that
              properly capture certain key  aspects of the uncertainty or variability in
              models of physical  objects and processes will be investigated, and efficient 
              algorithms for manipulating these models effectively will be  developed.  It is
              expected that this set of research directions  will generate new mathematical
              and algorithmic problems that will  be interesting and worthy of study on their
              own right, in  addition to producing geometric tools that are well-tailored to 
              physical world applications.  ***
