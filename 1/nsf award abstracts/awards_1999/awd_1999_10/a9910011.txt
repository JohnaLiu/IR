This award supports the development of a new tool that will
              automatically sample water from a variety of natural environments.  Although
              many questions in hydrology, hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry can be
              addressed by detailed spatial mapping and time series measurements of the
              chemical and isotopic composition of water, field logistics of large sampling
              programs prohibit collection of sufficient number of samples to answer those
              questions.  Commercially available automatic samplers are relatively expensive
              and are designed for use in developed water systems, limiting their utility in
              many studies of natural systems.  The sampler will be housed in a water tight
              case and deployed directly within the body of water to be sampled (e.g. rivers,
              lakes, springs, caves, estuaries).  The sampler will consist of individual
              spring loaded syringes that are sealed by solenoid valves operated by a
              microprocessor.  When a valve opens, the spring expands and pulls a water
              sample into the syringe.  The valve then closes, sealing the water in the
              syringe.  The sampler as planned will be inexpensive (~$500) and simple to
              construct and operate.  The sampler will be used initially for on-going studies
              of karst hydrogeology.  Its design will be described in publications and
              diagrams of the system will be made available on the world wide web, thereby
              insuring a wide distribution, continued technical development, and addition of
              new applications.
