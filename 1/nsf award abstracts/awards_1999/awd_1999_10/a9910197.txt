Anomalous biotic and physical trends in mid-Cretaceous strata
              of the northern U.S. Western Interior basin have prompted some authors to
              propose a brief connection between the northern/Boreal and southern/Tethyan arm
              of the Western Interior sea at the time of the Early/Late Cretaceous boundary,
              even though no direct physical evidence for such a connection is yet cited. 
              The proposed research will test this hypothesis by applying sequence
              stratigraphic, paleontologic, palynologic, and chemostratigraphic techniques to
              mid-Cretaceous strata in the central Western Interior where a connection may be
              recorded.  The study aims to clarify several stratigraphic issues in
              economically important mid-Cretaceous strata of the United States and Canada. 
              Its broader implications are to reevaluate Cretaceous faunal mixing and
              evolutionary trends, and to constrain the enigmatic Lower/Upper Cretaceous
              boundary in North America.  The resultant integrated stratigraphic framework is
              also the first step in testing the currently published hypothesis that the
              proposed brief marine connection is responsible for the regional anoxic event,
              and associated changes in the global carbon cycle, recorded in mid-Cretaceous
              strata of Canada.  This is particularly important to modem climate modeling,
              because many modem transgressing oceans are separated by only a low and narrow
              isthmus.
