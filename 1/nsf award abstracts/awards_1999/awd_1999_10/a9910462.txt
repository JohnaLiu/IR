Abstract    :
              A major gene regulating social behavior has been discovered in the fire ant
              Solenipsis invicta.  In this species there are two distinct forms; colonies
              with a single queen and colonies with many queens.  Field studies of the
              distribution of the Gp-9 gene show that genetic differences among queens are
              correlated with whether or not they are found in single or multiple queen
              colonies.   Laboratory studies have further shown that worker tolerance for a
              queen is also dependent on the genotype of both the queen and the worker.  The
              Gp-9 variation is also correlated with accumulation of fat reserves in queens.
              Ross and Krieger will be determining the amino acid sequence for the protein
              coded by the Gp-9 gene and will be using this information to determine its
              nucleotide sequence.  Once this sequence is know it may be possible to study
              the cascade of events that lead to differences in sociality that appear to be
              based on this major gene.
