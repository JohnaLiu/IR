The proposed research expands and extends the PI's current
              NSF award, CHE-9730984 aimed specifically at exploring one class of
              organic-based magnets that the PI's group discovered, namely, the study of
              soluble, coordination polymeric magnets comprised of [Mpor]+[TCNE]-.S (por =
              porphyrin; S = solvent) (TCNE = tetracyanoethylene) via a collaboration with
              Prof. Jinkwon Kim of the Kongju National University in Korea.   This
              collaboration will take advantage of the synthetic expertise of Prof. Kim's
              group to prepare ferroceneyl substitued porphyrins, and to develop
              methodologies to fabricate a self assembled monolayer and prepare
              [Mpor]+[TCNE]-.S magnets as controlled thin films from the monolayer surface. 
              

The overall goals of the collaborative research are:
(1) understanding the
              fundamental science that governs the magnetic behavior of these soluble
              polymeric magnets;
(2) identifying new phenomena; and
(3) making obms with
              controllable and high odering temperatures, Tc, and coercive fields.

This
              project will be performed in conjunction with Prof. Kim of the Kongju National
              University, Korea.   This project is relevant to the objectives of the
              U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program, which seeks to increase the level of
              cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the
              exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through
              collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported
              by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
