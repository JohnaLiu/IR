Abstract    :
              The occurrence of hypoxia/anoxia in coastal waters has been increasing in
              frequency and duration. Studies of the impact of hypoxia/anoxia on the biota of
              estuarine and coastal waters have typically focused on commercially important
              benthic or demersal fauna. The impact on zooplankton has received little
              attention yet micro- and meso- zooplankton are important elements in marine
              food webs. Copepods in particular constitute a critical component of the diet
              of larval fish in these regions. This research is concerned with the population
              -level consequences of hypoxia and anoxia for marine copepods. Because copepods
              are one of the most abundant zooplankton groups in pelagic marine systems, the
              detrimental effects of low oxygen levels on copepods can have a sizable impact
              on their many predators. These studies will combine experimental manipulations
              with matrix population models constructed from laboratory results. The final
              product will allow an examination of how hypoxia/anoxia affects copepod
              populations and by association, the juvenile fish that rely on these organisms
              for food during this critical life stage.
