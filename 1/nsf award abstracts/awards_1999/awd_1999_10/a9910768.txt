Special Project: Research
              Foundations on Successful Participants of Underrepresented Minorities in
              Information Technology: A Virtual Conference

This project is oriented to
              finding research directions for the determination and remediation of
              fundamental causes that prevent underrepresented minorities (Blacks, Hispanics
              and Native Americans) from participating in the mainstream educational and
              research opportunities in Information Technology.

The project will be
              carried out with minimal travel, and will utilize NSF software support for a
              virtual environment in which the co-Pis, the moderators, and the discussants
              will interact via the WWW by posting and summarizing ideas, concepts, and
              opinions on the four topics that we will cover; outreach, teaching, research,
              and mentoring. The names of the four topics are only labels that we have chosen
              and incorporate broader implications.

The virtual conference should produce
              a report that will inform the community of the results of the exchange and will
              be appropriately disseminated.
