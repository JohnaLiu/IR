Abstract    :
              In health care, social differences can affect how people perceive, speak with,
              listen to, and interpret one another. Specifically, studies report that Black
              and White patients with the same symptoms, gender and insurance may be treated
              differently as they communicate in a predominantly White health care system.
              Black and White people participate in common and separate speech communities,
              but whether their language use and inferences differ in health care settings
              has not been adequately investigated.

This study will examine ways of
              speaking and documented outcomes as White physicians speak with Black
              adolescents of the same gender and with the same health insurance. The AMC/CDC 
              Measuring Adolescent Preventive Services (MAPS) study provides a corpus of
              recorded untranscribed interviews which will be sampled and studied using
              conversation analytic methods. Using ethnography of communication, the analysis
              will compare language forms, discourse processes and linguistic strategies with
              meanings patients assigned after health encounters. This study investigates how
              language practices constitute or mediate symbolic racial identification, and
              whether these practices affect communication in health encounters.
