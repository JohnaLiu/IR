This dissertation-enhancement award supports Dwight Adams's
              graduate student Todd Sherline, from the University of Florida, to spend a year
              at the Hahn-Meitner Institute (HMI) in Berlin, Germany.  The research studies
              magnetically ordered solid Helium-3 using magnetization-demagnetization at the
              University of Florida and neutron scattering and transmission at the HMI.  The
              only technique for unambiguous determination of magnetic structure is neutron
              scattering, and the HMI is the only facility in the world which has both the
              neutron source and the cryogenic apparatus necessary for the research that will
              be done.  The experiments will provide information crucial for a full
              understanding of exchange processes in a fundamental magnetic system.
