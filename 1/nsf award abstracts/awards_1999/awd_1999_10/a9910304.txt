Abstract

This proposal is to build an improved version of
              a High Spectral Resolution Lidar (Laser Radar), test it and then deploy it at a
              site near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.  The objective is to provide a long term record
              of Arctic cloud and aerosol variables.  The scientific goals include
              observations of a full annual cycle of cloud properties; provide a quantitative
              assessment of Arctic haze; and identify pollution sources.
