Abstract    :
              Research on autobiographical memory has proliferated in recent years, both in
              personality and in cognitive psychology. Yet there has been little exchange of
              ideas between the two areas. Cognitive analyses of autobiographical memory are
              methodologically sophisticated, but they typically do not consider personality
              variables --  even though self-relevant memories are inherently linked to
              personality. Analyses of personality often rely on narrative accounts to study
              autobiographical memory, allowing sensitivity to the role of individual
              difference factors such as motives and goals that contribute to the variability
              of autobiographical memories. Yet, these narrative data do not allow for the
              investigation of the mediating factors that determine the variability in such
              memories. The current research examines a model of autobiographical memory that
              bridges the gap between personality and cognitive research, focusing on how
              basic cognitive processes impact social functioning. The research findings
              should reveal how encoding processes allow individuals to understand their life
              experiences in ways that may have a profound impact on their social
              functioning.
