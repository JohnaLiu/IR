Proposal Number: CTS 9910538
Principal Investigator:  V.

This grant will support participation by US scientists, faculty, and
              graduate students at the Third International Workshop on Modeling in Crystal
              Growth.
The intent of the funding is to expand the research base and student
              participation. 
The previous two workshops were held in Germany and Belgium
              and with the increased emphasis on crystal growth it is appropriate that a
              workshop be held in the United States. The workshop will cover a broad range of
              topics related to mathematical modeling and numerical analysis of the growth of
              single crystals and crystalline layers.  It will focus on physical phenomena
              taking place at the macro-, meso-, and micro-scale, global modeling of the
              processes, model-based design of experiments, and the use of the models for
              prototyping and control.  Speakers, who do not normally work in crystal growth
              but whose expertise will assist in understanding the growth process, will give
              presentations in the areas of thermal manufacturing, computational material
              processing, process optimization, virtual reality, and control. An abstract
              proceeding and a volume containing peer reviewed papers will be
              published.
