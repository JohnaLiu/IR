Abstract    :
              The workshop is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the United
              States, and by the European Commission (EC) of the European Union, as part of
              an official agreement between the US and the EU about collaboration on
              Information Technology research. It is targeted towards the topic of "Large
              Scientific Databases". The motivation for research in this area is the rapidly
              increasing number and size of collections of scientific data that are produced
              by instruments (such as satellite-borne radar) and simulations (run on
              computers with very large memories and fast processors). These data collections
              are very large -- reaching into the petabyte size; they must be accessible to
              geographically distributed user communities; furthermore they may be a fusion
              of heterogeneously curated collections. This small (30 person) workshop will
              examine current research thrusts and formulate the intellectual content for
              future joint EU/US research projects. The results are expected to lay the
              architecture for intelligent and thoughtful collaboration in the area of
              scientific databases in the next century. Information systems motivated by this
              workshop will allow the scientific fusion of the work of multiple,
              multilingual, multidisciplinary research groups to be used by others as the
              basis of new science. The workshop results will be available at
              http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/euus/.
