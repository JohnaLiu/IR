This project will support a 3-day
              planning workshop in November 1999 to develop recommendations to initiate
              computerization of all herbaria in the US.  the key to the overall project is a
              system of bioinformatics "circuit riders" operating from one or more home
              stations, who will travel to herbaria and provide instruction in museum
              computerization, initiate the capture of label information, and distribute
              educational materials on bioinformatics and computerization of herbarium
              information.  Workshop participants will include herbarium curators, plant
              systematists, bioinformatics specialists, collection managers, and operating
              system managers.  This project will integrate with the developing concepts of
              an information network as part of the National Ecological Observatory Network
              and BON.
