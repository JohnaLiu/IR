Abstract    :
              This proposal is an SGER request to investigate new device concepts based on
              electron spin dynamics and coupled coherent phenomena.  If successful, the PIs
              plan to have a follow up proposal on the combined theoretical and experimental
              research plan to design, fabricate and test the devices to thoroughly evaluate
              their concepts.  This SGER request is consistent with NSF supporting work in
              the nanotechnology area and in support of extending the semconductor industry
              association roadmap beyond its current conclusion in 2010.
