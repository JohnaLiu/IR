Abstract    :
              This is an investigation of the influence of an electric field on combustion
              synthesis.  The effects of an electric field through thermal (Joule heating),
              mass transport (electrotransport), and capacitive (dielectric) contributions
              are studied.  The work includes both solid-solid and solid-liquid reaction
              systems.  Effects of both the magnitude and direction of AC current on the
              nucleation and growth of product layers at the interfaces are determined
              quantitatively.  Models are based on mass transport flux equations modified by
              electrotransport (electromigration).  The process of ignition by an electric
              field in also studied; a better understanding of product formation and
              homogeneity is desired.

The technological implications of this work are
              large:  synthesis of materials systems that are achievable only by activated
              SHS (self-sustained high-temperature synthesis); modification of composition
              and morphology of SHS products including nanomaterials; and modification of
              interfacial interactions in such applications as functionally graded materials
              (FGMs), thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), and chemical barrier coatings (CBCs);
              and one-step synthesis and densification of ceramic materials.
