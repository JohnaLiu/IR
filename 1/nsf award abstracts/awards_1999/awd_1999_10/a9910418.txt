The recommended project will develop and deploy instruments
              that will measure temperature, pressure, and electrical conductivity with time
              within a standard Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) standard Advanced Piston Core
              (APQ core barrel during core recovery. The instruments will consist of sensors
              and a data logger within specially constructed core barrels. They will record
              the development of free gas in core during recovery, resulting in core
              temperature anomalies (cooling) and a decrease in electrical conductivity.
              Evaluation of conductivity and temperature with time, when combined with
              pressure data, will allow qualitative estimation of abundance of methane
              hydrate, determination of whether the free gas is resulting from methane
              hydrate breakdown, and subsequent stratigraphic determination of methane
              hydrate presence and stability in the cored section. Five instruments will be
              built, with development and building of the sensor package at the Monterey Bay
              Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), development and building of the data
              recording package as well as overall assembly at the ODP Science Operator
              (Texas A&M University), and initial remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) testing by
              MBARL Three of these systems will be deployed on board the JOIDES Resolution in
              time for anticipated gas hydrate drilling in 2001, one will be deployed by the
              MBARI ROV, and one will remain at MBARI for use as a troubleshooting reference.
              These instruments should greatly advance our ability to estimate methane
              hydrate stability, occurrence, and volume, thereby expanding our Nation's
              ability to estimate methane energy reserves and possible climactic effects of
              sea level lowering (with subsequent release of methane, a greenhouse gas).
