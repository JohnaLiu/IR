Abstract    :
              This proposal funds the analysis of uranium series (U-series) disequilibria in
              mid-ocean ridge basalt samples erupted within transform faults that offset
              mid-ocean ridges.  Because mixing of mantle melts is less pronounced at this
              tectonic setting relative to the ridge axis, samples from transforms provide a
              window to observe the diversity of basalts produced by melting of the earth's
              mantle. U-series disequilibria data provide the ability to study the melting
              process by constraining the rate of formation and ascent of magmas through the
              mantle including quantification of the rate of solid upwelling.  This grant
              will fund the determination of (230Th)/(238U), (226Ra)/(230Th) and
              (231Pa)/(235U) in 25-30 samples from the Cox, Blanco, Garrett and Siqueiros
              Transforms.  These data will in turn be combined with complementary U-series
              data from adjacent portions of mid-ocean ridge and major and trace element data
              in order to evaluate the following questions. 1) What is the effect of mantle
              cooling due to transform offsets on how the mantle melts? 2) Is there an
              observable relationship between the amount of 230Th-238U disequilibria and the
              major element characteristics of primitive basalts? 3) Does the solid upwelling
              rate beneath the transform differ significantly from the adjacent ridge axis? 
              Answers to these questions will lead toward the goal of providing an integrated
              view of the genesis of mid-ocean ridge basalt.
