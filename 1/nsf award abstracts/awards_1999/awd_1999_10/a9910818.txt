Abstract    :
              Project Summary

The NorthWest Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET) at
              Bellevue Community College and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
              Engineers (IEEE) are collaborating on the development of a suite of information
              technology (IT) career education materials targeted toward middle and high
              school teachers, counselors and students.  These materials will ensure that
              pre-service and in-service teachers and counselors have up-to-date and
              compelling information about the rapidly developing field of IT and the
              emerging careers in this area.  Deliverables will include prototype teaching
              tools, in-service workshops, self-study print materials, and a website that
              builds basic subject matter expertise for teachers and counselors about IT. 
              Teachers will have access to resources that guide student learning about
              technology careers, the importance of technological literacy, and the
              recommended scholastic preparation for success in IT careers.  The project will
              pave the way for full-scale development of publishable materials for national
              dissemination.
