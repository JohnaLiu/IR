This award provides funding to make available a
              new data source for social and economic research-information from the 1880 U.S.
              Census of Populations.  The database covers the entire U.S. population and is 
              an important resource for the study of the  economic and social organization of
              late-nineteenth century American society.    The late nineteenth century is a
              critical period in the study of fertility decline, urbanization, immigration,
              household composition, and occupational structure.  The 1880 database includes
              a wealth of information on these topics that will be fully explored through the
              creation of this new microdata set.  The microdata set will be an improvement
              over the extant 1880 IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata set) sample,
              allowing for the cross-tabulation of a wide range of topics that were not
              covered by census publications or incompletely tabulated, filling a gap in
              aggregate data series for counties and cities.  More importantly, this
              availability of this data set opens up the potential for longitudinal and
              multi-level multivariate analyses.

The database will be distributed via the
              "International Integrated Microdata Access System," an infrastructure project 
              funded by the National Science Foundation, as well as through conventional data
              archives.  To ensure long-term preservation, the database will be transferred
              to stable media and permanently archived in the new long-term digital storage
              facility of the University of Minnesota Library.  In addition, the completed
              database and machine-readable documentation will be deposited in the Center for
              Electronic Records of the National Archives and Records Administration land the
              Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social (ICPSR) in Ann Arbor,
              Michigan.
