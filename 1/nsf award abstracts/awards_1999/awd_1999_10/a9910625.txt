Abstract    :
              Ethnographic Research Training Grants provide funds for graduate students in
              cultural anthropology to obtain much-needed ethnographic research experience
              prior to writing and submitting research proposals for doctoral fieldwork.
              Successful dissertation proposals are usually dependent on the authors' having
              visited their field sites and conducted preliminary research; this allows the
              student to write a proposal that is both well-informed about the research
              locale and people (often in foreign countries) and theoretically and
              methodologically sound.
