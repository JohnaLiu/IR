Abstract    :
              The Gordon Research Conference on Composite Materials is one of the few Gordon
              Research Conferences that address a field within the purview of materials
              science.  The field of composite materials is highly interdisciplinary,
              
Requiring efforts of physicists, chemists, mechanicians, mathematicians and
              materials scientists.  The atmosphere of a Gordon Research Conference includes
              an ample time for informal discussions among participants and is renown for
              fostering interactions among scientists form different disciplines.  This
              interaction is essential for progress to be made in an interdisciplinary
              subject like composite materials.  One of the best conference experiences a
              scientist can have is to attend a Gordon Research Conference in his or her area
              of specialization.

The speakers invited to the 2000 Gordon Research
              Conference on Composite Materials will cover a range of subjects, including
              biomemetics, novel approaches to manufacturing of composites, nanocomposites,
              and interfacial issues.  Emphasis will be placed on how the composites
              community should handle the issues that remained unresolved as the 20th century
              come to a close, and on where the composites community should best place it's
              efforts to meet the challenges it faces at the beginning of the 21st Century.
