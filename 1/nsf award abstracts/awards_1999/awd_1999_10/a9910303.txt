Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

Summit Greenland is a site of expanding scientific interest by both
              U.S. and European scientists.  Current U.S. projects are evaluating ice-core
              characteristics related to environmental change, are investigating upper and
              middle atmosphere phenomena as a basis for understanding the global system, are
              evaluating atmospheric conditions in the troposphere and in the boundary layer
              contacting the Greenland permanent ice sheet, and are establishing the
              radiation, energy, and water balances which occur on the ice-pack.  To better
              coordinate the disparate communities using this environmental observatory, a
              Science Coordination Office will be established.   Its goals are to: 1)
              coordinate measurements between investigators and the sharing of facilities and
              personnel on-site, 2) provide scientific requirements to NSF, it's support
              contractor and European partners as the facility is developed, 3) stimulate
              sharing of data among science projects.
