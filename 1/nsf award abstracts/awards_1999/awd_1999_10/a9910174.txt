Abstract    :
              9910174  Ball  The objective of this project is to obtain an improved
              understanding of the manner in which organic contaminants of surface and
              groundwater are absorbed and adsorbed on substances such as charcoal, shale and
              sand.  Processes used in water treatment practice frequently depend on
              adsorptive and absorptive characteristics of substances used or produced during
              the treatment process.  In related prior research supported by his Presidential
              Young Investigator award from the National Science Foundation (9196241) the
              investigator studied sorptive properties of soils toward two synthetic organic
              soil contaminants (triochlorobenzene and trichloroethene).  Soils studied
              emerged from a common parent rock but differed in their content of soil organic
              matter as influenced by differences in natural decomposition products and
              infiltration of water.  In this project the investigator plans to increase the
              number of soil contaminants to include chlorobenze, two dichlorobenzenes,
              chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, lindane and diuron.  These compounds differ
              sufficiently significantly enough in their octanol-water distribution ratios
              and aqueous solubility for results of this work to be used in evaluating the
              Polanyi theory's potential usefulness in predicting sorptive behavior of soil. 
              Results of this research may be applied to calibration of mathematical models
              that predict the performance of processes affecting the dispersive properties
              of organic contaminants of soil as affected by natural decomposition processes
              and leaching.  This knowledge is expected to lead toward better engineering
              design and use of environmental technologies than is now possible for processes
              and systems to decontaminate soil to reduce or eliminate the pollutional
              influence of contaminants on the quality of grounewater and prevent movement of
              contaminants from contaminated sites. ***
