Abstract    :
              This is part of a group proposal(s):  ( REC-9903153 and REC-9910637), that seeks
              funding to continue funding of the Princeton Earth Physics Project (PEPP). 
              This project continues to bring hands-on science into the high school
              classroom, based on a network of earthquake recording seismographs.  It is an
              integrated, real-world endeavor, combining experience and practice of
              scientific data acquisition and analysis, cooperation and data sharing on the
              Internet, and a curriculum which, while based on earthquake study, cuts across
              the disciplinary boundaries of physics, geoscience, mathematics and computer
              sciences.  It is also a program for nucleating a 'scientific community" of  PEP
              teachers, students, and mentors from the research community.
