Abstract    :
                  This research project is a laboratory study aimed at elucidating the
              kinetics and reaction mechanisms which control the atmospheric oxidation of
              sulfur compounds.  The emphasis of this project is on oxidation pathways for
              dimethylsulfide (DMS, CH3SCH3), and its intermediate oxidation products
              dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, CH3S(O)CH3) and methanesulfinic acid (MSIA,
              CH3S(O)OH). There is currently considerable interest in atmospheric sulfur
              oxidation in order to facilitate our understanding of (1) past climate as
              interpreted from ice core analyses and (2) the role sulfur plays in particle
              formation and growth in the atmosphere and its resulting impact on current and
              future climate.
    Specific experimental investigations which will be
              undertaken include (1) studies of the kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions
              of BrO radicals with DMS and DMSO, as well as the reactions of Cl, Br, and O
              atoms with DMSO; (2) a study of the CH3SCH2OO + HO2 radical-radical reaction;
              (3) studies of the aqueous phase reactions of OH, SO4-, NO3, and Cl2- radicals
              with DMSO, MSIA, MSA, and dimethylsulfone (DMSO2, CH3(O)S(O)CH3); (4) studies
              of the reaction kinetics of MSIA(g); and (5) development of optical and/or mass
              spectrometric techniques for detection of CH3SOx (x = 1-3) radicals.  A new,
              high pressure turbulent flow reactor will be constructed and utilized during
              the course of this research.  The flow reactor will be coupled with CIMS
              (chemical ionization mass spectrometry,  PIMS (photoionization mass
              spectrometry), and TDLAS (tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy)
              detectors.
