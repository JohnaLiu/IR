Abstract    :
              	The award is being made as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research.  Dr.
              Krishnamurti will extend some intriguing preliminary work on the use of
              multi-model superensemble forecasts for the prediction of hurricane track and
              intensity.  The method relates the past performance of the multiple models to
              an observed "analysis" state using a simple regression procedure.  All of the
              multi-model results are regressed with respect to this analysis for a control
              period and then the statistics are applied to a forecast period and a weighted
              combination is produced which is the superensemble.  In the initial work, the
              superensemble has always outperformed the individual model forecasts.  Under
              this award, Dr. Krishnamurti will carry out the superensemble forecasts in
              real-time as a further test of the method.  After the 1999 operational
              hurricane season is over, he and his colleagues will analyze and evaluate the
              1999 superensemble forecasts and explore the efficacy of using statistical
              methods other than simple regression in their superensemble forecasts.
