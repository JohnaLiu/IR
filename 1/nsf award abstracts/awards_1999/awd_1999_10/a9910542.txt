This award supports a planning visit to the United Kingdom for
              the purpose of developing a collaborative proposal on improving education
              programs in museums and zoological parks.  Zoological parks and museums are
              wonderful educational resources, but research has shown that visits to them
              have very limited educational value, in particular for children.  The
              investigators, Dawn Yonally of California State University, San Marcos, and Sue
              Dale Tuncliffe of Homerton College, Cambridge, propose to design a research
              project that addresses the response of elementary students and their
              accompanying adults to museum and zoological exhibits.  In order to gauge 
              their educational effectiveness, the investigators will use criteria developed
              by the Office of Standards in Education in the United Kingdom.  The ultimate
              aim of their long-term project will be to provide data and the complementary
              pedagogical expertise of the investigators.  For purpose of this study, the
              investigators plan to develop a project involving exhibits at the London and
              San Diego zoos, two of the largest and finest zoological parks in the
              world.
