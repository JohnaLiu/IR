              of the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, National
              Research Council's Water Science Technology Board.  This Board provides a focal
              point for studies related to environmental engineering and hydrology.  The
              Board's objective is to improve the scientific and technological basis for
              resolving important questions and issues relating to  management of water
              resources.  An important function of the Water Science Technology Board is to
              conduct studies and to sponsor workshops and conferences that can be utilized
              for program planning purposes.  The Board also functions as an appropriate
              means for coordination of research plans with other Federal agencies including
              the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Geological Survey, Environmental
              Protection Agency, Department of Energy and the Army Corps of Engineers.***
