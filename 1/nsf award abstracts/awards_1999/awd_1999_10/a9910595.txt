	This award provides fifty- percent partial funding support
              for the acquisition of instrumentation to perform cathodoluminescence (CL)
              microscopy in the Principal Investigator's laboratory in the Department of
              Geology and Geophysics at the University of California, Berkeley. The
              University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for the
              acquisition. In CL microscopy, a polished rock sample is bombarded with
              electrons from a cathode gun, causing certain minerals to emit characteristic
              visible light and making it possible to recognize fine differences in
              composition or defects. The technique works especially well with the carbonate
              minerals such as calcite and dolomite that are the dominant minerals of
              limestones. Specific luminescent colors in calcite change with the ratio of Mn
              to Fe, which varies from zone to zone, depending on the conditions of crystal
              growth during rock formation. The new laboratory capability in CL microscopy
              will be applied to research projects on the stratigraphy, sedimentology, and
              tectonic deformation of limestones as well as the study of rocks formed from
              ejecta of large impacts with meteorites.
