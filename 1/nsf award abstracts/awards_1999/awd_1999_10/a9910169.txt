Abstract    :
              This Special Project provides opportunities for presentation and participation
              at the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE)
              Symposium.  the showcase participants are recipients of the National Science
              Foundation Division of Undergraduate Education's Course, Curriculum and
              Laboratory Improvement (NSF DUE CCLI) Program grants.  The project provides
              supplemental travel funds to participants to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium to
              be held March 8-12 in Austin, TX.   This is an international conference held
              annually in the United States,   It is one of the few dedicated solely to
              issues of undergraduate computing education.   The conference attracts over 900
              educators, primarily from the United States and Canada, with a growing
              worldwide participation. 

The showcase participants are from the CCLI award
              winners from the 1999 and 2000 set of proposals.   This will allow for
              presentation of formative evaluation results from both A&I and EMD type
              projects so that conference attendees will be able to see different
              developmental stages of such projects.  The showcase will benefit both the CCLI
              grantees as well as the conference attendees by allowing an early and informal
              forum for evaluation, dissemination and feedback.  This allows for a much
              broader dissemination of information about CCLI-funded projects than might
              otherwise be possible.    The anticipated outcomes of the showcase event are a
              better informed computer science education community and increased interest in
              submitting proposals to the CCLI program.
