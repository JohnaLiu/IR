Abstract    :
              This award will support the generation of planktic and benthic foraminiferal
              stable isotope data, and concentration of ice-rafted detritus, at
              multi-century-scale resolution for sediment cores from the Southern Ocean
              Spanning the last half million years.  The data will be used to determine how
              millenial-scale variability has evolved during the late Pleistocene and its
              relation to orbital forcing.
