Abstract    :
              The project develops a test, called the Energy Concept Inventory (ECI), to
              assess student qualitative understanding of energy concepts.  The ECI is
              similar in design and purpose to the Force Concept Inventory (FCI).  For ease
              of use, the ECI has a multiple-choice format that forces discrimination of
              scientific aspects of energy storage and transfer from students' common sense
              alternatives.  Like the FCI, the ECI is intended for use in comparative studies
              of student knowledge and learning at all grade levels from middle school to
              graduate school.  Moreover, the ECI assesses aspects of energy understanding
              that are essential to chemistry and biology as well as physics.
