Abstract    :
              A 3D seismic survey over the gas-hydrate field on Blake Ridge is planned with
              the objective to extend information from ODP sites drilled during Leg 164 over
              a part of the hydrate province.  R/V Ewing will be used to obtain two related
              seismic data sets:  1) and 3D image of the hydrate deposits, and 2) a study of
              the P to S  converted waves in the hydrate province.  The obtained information,
              when combined with chemical, sedimentological and downhole logging information
              from Leg 164 will constitute a rare opportunity to establish benchmarck
              linkages between seismic signature (reflectivity, P-velocity, S-velocity) and
              amounts and distriubtion of hydrate and free gas.  The data will also provide
              basic 3D geometries of stratigraphy, structures, hydrate concentration, and gas
              accumulations over the study area.  The information provided by this experiment
              will help constrain serveral key processes that occur in gas hydrate provinces,
              including methanogenesis, hydrate formation and decomposition, and migration of
              free gas.
