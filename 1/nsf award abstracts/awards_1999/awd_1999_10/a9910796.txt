WGBH is undertaking a planning phase to develop "PEEP and the
              Big, Wide World," a daily, half-hour series for the preschool and kindergarten
              public television audience.  The series will use the explorations and
              adventures of a newly-hatched chick and his animal friends as the foundation
              for an initiative in early childhood science and math education.  The goal of
              the project is to introduce science and math to a broad, diverse audience of
              children in an exciting and developmentally appropriate way.   During this
              planning phase, the project will:

1)  Bring the Science Content Director on
              board to work with the production staff and advisors;

2)  Develop the series
              curriculum;

3)  Create a series "bible" where principal characters, visual
              design, approach to science and math, and       sample story ideas are sketched
              out;

4)  Write two story treatments for the series; and

5)   Conduct
              preliminary testing of PEEP with the target audience.

The Principal
              Investigator for the project will be Kate Taylor, Director of Children's
              Programming at WGBH. Karen Worth, Senior Scientist at EDC, will serve as
              Content Director.  For production of the series, WGBH will team with Derek
              Lamb, former Executive Director of Animation at the National Film Board of
              Canada, and Kaj Pindal, former Head of Animation at Danish Television.
