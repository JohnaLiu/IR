This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration involves
              Gregory J. Salamo, a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student from the
              University of Arkansas and Mathieu Chauvet and his research group at the
              University of Franche-Comte.  The investigators propose to develop ultra-fast,
              Kerr soliton based, optical interconnect arrays in a semiconductor material
              that could be integrated into electronic packages.  An optical spatial soliton
              is a beam that maintains a constant profile during propagation.  Spatial
              solitons using the Kerr effect in an Aluminum-Gallium-Arsenic/Gallium-Arsenic
              semiconductor slab waveguide will be studied.  The U.S. team brings to this
              collaboration expertise in semiconductor materials growth and physics.  This is
              complemented by French strengths in the fabrication of complex practical
              devices.  They are expert in the use of Kerr modulation in device construction.
               

This award represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the
              French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel
              funds and living expenses for the U.S. investigator, postdoctoral researcher
              and graduate student.  The CNRS will support the visits of the French
              researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance understanding
              of optical interconnect arrays and their potential applications in
              telecommunications.
