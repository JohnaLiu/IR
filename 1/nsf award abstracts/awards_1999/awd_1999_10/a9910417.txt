Partial travel
              support is provided for a workshop, entitled NanoForum CH-US 99, a
              Swiss-US-Forum on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, with focus on Experimental
              and Simulation Tools for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology to be held in Zurich,
              Switzerland from September 20-22, 1999.  The workshop will address the
              following issues:

a) Interdependence and synergism between scientific
              discovery and technology in nanoscale research
b) The path from fundamental
              discovery of new properties and phenomena to industrial applications in
              nanotechnology
c) Ways to facilitate and best utilize current and expected
              leap advances in nanotechnology.

This NanoForum will bring together leading
              senior and young scientist from the US and Switzerland who are working in the
              field of Nanoscience.  In addition to the scientific talks, existing networks
              concerning Nanoscience will be introduced and briefly described.

On the
              Swiss side, the NanoForum will be supported by the Swiss National Science
              Foundation, the Swiss Association for Nanoscience and Technology, the Swiss
              Programme on Micro and Nanosystems, and the Swiss Academy of Science and
              Technology.
