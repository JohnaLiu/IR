This grant supports upgrade of the Neutron Activation Analysis
              (NAA) Facility in the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Department at
              the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The major aspect of the upgrade is
              to acquire a state of the art spectroscopy platform which integrates data
              acquisition and reduction into a single computer system.  In addition, a Ge
              semi-conductor will be acquired as well as improvements to the sample
              preparation facilities.  The facility is supervised by Professor F.A. Frey and
              Dr. P. Ila.  It is principally used to determine abundances of trace elements
              in volcanic and mantle rocks.  Specifically gamma ray spectroscopy following
              neutron irradiation in the MIT Nuclear Reactor is used to determine abundances
              of 10 to 25 elements in 0.1 to 0.5 grams of powdered rock.  This facility is
              used by MIT undergraduates and graduate students in the MIT and joint MIT-WHOI
              programs as well as researchers from other universities in the northeast U.S.
              (e.g., University of Massachusetts at Amherst).  Two ongoing major projects
              are: (1) Studies of lavas recovered by the Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project
              whose goal is to sample the entire growth and evolution of a Hawaiian volcano;
              and (2) studies of lavas related to the 115 Million year volcanic history of
              the Kerguelen plume in the eastern Indian Ocean.  This project includes
              geochemical research on igneous rocks recovered from the Kerguelen Plateau by
              Ocean Drilling Program Leg 183 and basalts from the Kerguelen Archipelago
              obtained in a collaborative effort involving scientists from the USA, France
              and Belgium.
