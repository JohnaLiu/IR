Abstract    :
              The "Inside the Classroom" study will involve classroom observations of
              approximately 600 elementary, middle school, and high school mathematics
              teachers in 150 schools in 50 districts throughout the United States.  This
              study is to be conducted in conjunction with the 2000 National Survey of
              Science and Mathematics Education and will add to our knowledge of the
              frequency of class activities as reported by teachers with an understanding of
              the quality of instruction as assessed by knowledgeable observers.

Data will
              be collected by observers experienced in the use of the Classroom Observation
              Protocol developed by Horizon Research, Inc. for the evaluation of NSF's Local
              Systemic Change Initiative.  Additional training will be provided, including
              the rating of videotaped lessons and classroom visits by teams of observers to
              maximize interrater reliability.

Results of the study will be presented in a
              complete technical report, a highlights report aimed at policymakers, and a
              book suitable for a general audience.
