Abstract    :
              This proposal would provide for the modernization of an existing MF radar at
              Rarotonga (21.5S, 160W) in the tropical southern Pacific and operational
              support for two years.  Under this proposal, a new data acquisition system
              would be installed and the 8-bit receivers upgraded to 12- or 16-bit
              digitization.  The operational height range of the radar (currently 80-98 km)
              will be expanded downward to span most of the mesosphere (~60-98 km), and the
              measurement accuracy above 90 km will be improved.  The dynamic range of the
              existing 8-bit digitization has been shown to be grossly inadequate for
              mesospheric MF radar returns.  A variety of validation and technical studies
              have demonstrated that receiver saturation above 90 km (which is nearly
              unavoidable with 8-bit operation) results in wind magnitude under-estimates. 
              This source of bias will be eliminated and the upgrade will make the radar more
              reliable and increase its overall performance.  Rarotonga is situated in a key
              latitude belt where there are presently no measurement capabilities and is
              almost precisely conjugate (same longitude and opposite latitude) to an
              existing MF radar at Kauai, Hawaii.  The Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere
              Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite mission (beginning in May 2000) will
              foster combined data analysis from satellite instruments and multiple
              ground-based sites. For correlative global studies of phenomena like the
              diurnal tide it is essential that the participating radars provide unbiased
              winds with similar performance across systems.
