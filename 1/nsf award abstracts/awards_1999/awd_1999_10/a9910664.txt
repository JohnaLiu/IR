	This award provides two-thirds partial funding for the
              acquisition and refurbishment of a used electron microprobe instrument to be
              installed and operated in the Department of Geology at Brigham Young
              University. The University is committed to provide the remaining funds
              necessary for the acquisition and upgrade, as well as providing a technician
              for operation and maintenance of the instrument. The principal investigator and
              a team of faculty colleagues at Brigham Young University will use the electron
              microprobe for quantitative chemical analysis of geological samples needed for
              research projects and training of students.
