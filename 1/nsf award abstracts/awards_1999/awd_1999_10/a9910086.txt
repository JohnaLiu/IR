Nochetto
This award supports Ricardo Nochetto and three students from
              the University of Maryland in a collaboration with Gerhard Dzuik of the
              Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Freiburg, Germany.  The
              project will focus on error control for nonlinear partial differential
              equations via a posteriori error estimation.  The techniques will have
              applications for physical problems involving diffusion, advection, phase
              changes, and interface dynamics.  Such problems arise frequently in industrial
              applications, and raise fundamental and challenging questions that need to be
              addressed in order for the field to advance.  The collaboration combines
              complementary expertise and facilities on both sides.  In particular the
              innovative new software toolbox ALBERT, developed by the German group, is
              central to the proposed work, which will gain added value from the powerful
              theoretical capabilities of the U.S. group.
