Abstract    :
              A workshop on electrochemical, thermal, and modeling studies of lithium-ion
              cells will be held at the Illinois Institute of Technology in early November,
              1999.  These batteries are used in many portable information technology
              devices.  They are currently used in laptop computers and cell phones.  In
              addition to thermodynamic, thermal, and electrochemical issues, understanding
              at the molecular level will be discussed.  This workshop will bring together
              specialists who are involved in experimental and computational research. The
              workshop will attempt to integrate the approaches of computational researchers
              with those of experimentalists to facilitate breakthrough research in the area
              of novel electrode materials, electrochemical performance, and safety of
              lithium-ion cells from a fundamental viewpoint.
