Abstract    :
              Focusing on modeling the relationship between belief and behavior, this proposal
              will explore the reproductive health beliefs of the Tojolobal Maya (Chiapas,
              Mexico). It addresses the central question: "Are Tojolabal expert and
              non-expert ethnomedical beliefs a coherent domain organized around a consensual
              folk theory, a set of relatable but different models, or a body of scattered
              and idiosyncratic ideas?" It will document patterned variation in health
              beliefs and will test whether or not cognitive variation is a predictor of
              actual treatment-seeking behavior.
