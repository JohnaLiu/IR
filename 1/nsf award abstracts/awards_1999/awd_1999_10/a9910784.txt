Abstract    :
              The rapid growth and development of the information and communication
              technologies has led to wider diffusion and application, and consequently
              increased their economic and social impact across OECD Member countries, and
              beyond.  As the pace of change associated with information and communication
              technologies accelerates, it is becoming apparent that so too must the
              methodological and statistical work that attempts to measure it and that this
              could be best accomplished through a collective research program conducted
              under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
              (OECD).  This project will strive to create a rigorous statistical basis for
              the collection of internationally comparable statistics in these areas to
              support the creation of indicators and policy analysis of these studies.
