Abstract    :
              The project will provide travel support for approximately 15 students to attend
              the AGU Chapman Conference on Space Weather, which will be held in Clearwater,
              Florida from March 20 - 24, 2000.  The conference convenors are Dr. George
              Siscoe, Boston University and Dr. Paul Song, Univ. of Michigan.  The topics
              which will be covered at the conference include: solar wind/magnetosphere
              interactions, the structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere,
              magnetosphere/ionosphere interactions, nowcasting and forecasting of solar
              events, nowcasting and forecasting of magnetospheric disturbances and radiation
              hazards, and nowcasting and forecasting of ionospheric and thermospheric
              disturbances.
