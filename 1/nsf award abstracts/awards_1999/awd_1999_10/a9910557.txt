Abstract    :
              This project will examine how the market economy affects pastoral systems in
              Africa, specifically focusing on traditional institutions of mutual aid among
              the Fulani of Far North Province (Cameroon). Mutual aid institutions,
              particularly livestock loans, are interpreted as a redistributive mechanism
              that shapes access to the means of production (herds) and to stock friendships
              (social capital); they ensured survival and successful environmental adaptation
              among pastoralists prior to market integration. The research will examine how
              commoditization and economic diversification are altering the moral economy
              (non-market) and how Fulani pastoralists experience these changes. Two groups
              of Fulani, one sedentary and one pastoral, will be compared to measure
              differences in market involvement, economic diversification, wealth and
              inheritance, social networks, and mutual aid. The research addresses how
              traditional non-market economies are being integrated into markets, and how
              this reshapes their social institutions. Methods include participant
              observation, interviewing, and free-recall listings.
