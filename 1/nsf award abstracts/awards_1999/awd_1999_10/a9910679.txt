Abstract    :
              Adaptive changes in oxidative energy metabolism may be a key 
process in the
              origins of humankind. Subunits of cytochrome c 
oxidase, the terminal enzyme
              complex in the electron transport chain, 
and cytochrome c, the electron
              carrier between cytochrome bc1 and 
cytochrome oxidase, were previously shown
              to have both undergone 
periods of rapid amino acid substitutions in primates.
              These studies 
will now be extended to cytochrome bc1, an 11-subunit complex.
              Two 
problems will be addressed whose solutions will help provide insights
              
into the evolution and function of cytochrome bc1 and its potential 
role in
              anthropoid primates: (1) Cytochrome bc1 subunit genes and 
also cytochrome c
              will be examined to determine whether the encoded 
proteins underwent bursts
              of rapid amino acid substitutions in 
lineages leading to the anthropoid
              primates. (2) Positively selected 
changes in primates will be tested as to
              whether they take place not 
only via amino acid coding region changes but
              also via regulatory 
changes in the elements that control expression of the
              genes. This 
work will characterize some of the important genetic changes that
              
allowed the emergence of the large-brained primates.
