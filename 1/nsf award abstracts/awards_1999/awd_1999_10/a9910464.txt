Abstract    :
              This project will examine the evolution of resistance to pathogens and its
              interface with behavioral phenomena involved in the choice of mates and
              parental care.  The central question asks how differences in selection on males
              and females has affected the ability to resist disease.  Based on differences
              in the investments made by males and females in providing for offspring theory
              predicts a trade-off between disease resistance and reproduction.  Zuk will
              investigate the immune responses in field crickets where selection for
              investments in reproduction as opposed to investments in disease resistance are
              expected to be more pronounced in males than in females.  Zuk predicts that
              males will be less able to resist disease than females.  In vertebrates it
              widely known that this is the case.  This research will pioneer such studies in
              invertebrates that will therefore allow the development of a research
              methodology providing the potential to examine these questions in greater depth
              than previously possible.  This research will provide a powerful test of the
              theoretically predicted differences in the sexes in disease and parasite
              resistance due, ultimately, to differences in parental investment.  It is an
              important step in understanding the interface between molecular and
              physiological mechanisms and evolutionary process as mediated by behavior.
