Because of the extreme isolation
              of Antarctica since the early Oligocene one can expect to encounter a unique
              invertebrate fauna with a high degree of endemism.  Yet, some benthic taxa
              include from 20 to >50 percent non-endemic species.  To account for such
              species it has been proposed that an intermittent reciprocal exchange must
              occur between the antiboreal populations of South America and the Antarctic
              continent.  One possible means by which the geographical distribution can be
              maintained and genetic exchange may be accomplished is by the passive dispersal
              of planktonic larvae.  To show that such dispersal is actually accomplished it
              must be demonstrated that (1) larvae of sublittoral species actually are found
              within the Drake passage and that such larvae belong to species that occur both
              in the antiboreal South American and Antarctic faunas and (2) that a
              hydrographic mechanism exists that can explain how the passive transport of
              larvae may occur between the two continents.  The proposed research will
              address these two requirements by making transects of plankton samples across
              the Drake passage and by examining the possibility of cross frontal exchange of
              larvae at the subantarctic and polar fronts of the Antarctic circumpolar
              current as well as the possible transport of larvae in mesoscale rings.  The
              outcome may suggest species that in the future may profitably be examined using
              molecular techniques, comparing individuals from bottom populations of South
              America and Antarctica.  The study necessarily must be of a very preliminary
              nature since the occurrence of planktonic larvae of sublittoral benthic species
              in the Drake Passage has never before been examined.
