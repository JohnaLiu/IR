Thee Biomedical Engineering Alliance for Connecticut (BEACON)
              is presenting a Drug Discovery, Design, and Delivery Symposium on September 14,
              1999 at Aqua Turf Club, Plantsville, Connecticut.   The several objectives of
              the meeting are to: 1) present insights into new basic research in drug
              discovery, design and delivery, highlighting the important emerging roles for
              biomedical engineers; 2) present examples of successful academic/industrial
              collaborations in the drug discovery, design and delivery areas; 3) provide
              information about funding opportunities, including those for
              academic/industrial collaborations in these areas; and, 4) provide an
              opportunity for biomedical engineering students to learn about drug discovery,
              design and delivery. BEACON is a joint project of four educational
              institutions-University of Connecticut at Storrs, the University of Connecticut
              Health Center, the University of Hartford, and Trinity College. The symposium
              presentations are to be made by a group of eminent researchers and is expected
              to elicit interest from a national audience.  From 175-200 persons including
              20-30 students from BEACON affiliated institutions are expected to attend. 
              

The Symposium addresses an important area of interest to the Biomedical
              Engineering program, that of reaching out to industry and informing a wider
              audience than academic researchers about the nature and achievements of
              biomedical engineering, The symposium is well organized, new topics for
              engineering research will be reviewed, and the speakers are leaders in their
              fields of investigation. Dissemination of results of the meeting will occur in
              a printed publication for which funds are being provided by the National
              Science Foundation.
