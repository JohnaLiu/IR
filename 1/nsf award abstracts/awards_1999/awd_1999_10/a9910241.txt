Abstract    :
              The research analyzes the interaction of knowledge, behaviors and values in
              environmental decision making.  Data are collected from two sites where Native
              American and majority culture populations share a habitat but conflict over
              resource use:  the Wolf River area of Wisconsin and the Lowland Maya forest
              region of Guatemala.  Studies integrate formal modeling techniques from
              psychology, anthropology and sociology to show that: (1) people share cultural
              models of the environment to a surprisingly detailed degree; (2) these mental
              models inform and predict actual behaviors, with measurable ecological
              consequences; and (3) individual and cultural differences in models are
              motivated by different patterns of resource valuation.  Research findings are
              expected to establish: (4) a first approximation of ecological cognition across
              cultures, (5) a cognitive dimension to stimulate new research on how people
              decide to manage common resources; and (6) a comprehensive basis for
              conflict-resolution negotiation that involves understanding the relations
              between environmental cognitions, behaviors and values.
