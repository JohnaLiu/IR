In the last third of a century, instruments in space
              have brought forth great advances to our understanding of the cosmos.  Yet, in
              transparent or semi-transparent atmospheric windows ground-based observatories
              maintain important advantages in terms of versatility, flexibility, size and ,
              at much lesser cost, propel new technical developments and seminal research. 
              The sites for such observatories are in dry, high altitude locations where air
              flow tends to be nearly laminar.  This proposal aims at characterizing the
              astronomical properties of a region in the high Atacama Desert in northern
              Chile, which may turn out to be the best on Earth.
