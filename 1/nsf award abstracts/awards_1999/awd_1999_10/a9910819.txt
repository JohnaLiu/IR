Abstract    :
               

This is a proposal requesting consideration for a Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research (SGER) award. The proposal describes a one-year activity
              in which the PI will conduct an investigation on a new concept using intensity
              modulation to achieve quasi-phase matching (IMQPM) for improving the efficiency
              of second harmonic generation in a nonlinear optical crystal. The proposal is
              aimed at demonstration of this new concept using a single channel waveguide
              structure on LiNbO3 and analyzing the possibility of implementing the IMQPM in
              a dual-channel waveguide structure.
