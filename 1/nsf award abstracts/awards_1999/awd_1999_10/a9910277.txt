The American Geological Institute (AGI) proposes a three-day
              conference in Washington, D.C. of K-12 comprehensive mathematics and science
              curriculum developers.  The primary goal of this conference is to provide a
              forum for developers to find solutions to the problems they face in the
              development, field testing, publishing and implementation of reform-based math
              and science curriculum.  The conference format will address this goal by
              enabling developers to exchange information, interact with experts and build on
              the relationships established during past ScienceGate and Gateways to
              Mathematics conferences.  The conference agenda will take advantage of the
              synergy created by uniting science and math curriculum developers and yield a
              highly productive examination of content, pedagogy, recent revisions to
              standards and the development process.  A conference report and evaluation will
              be prepared and disseminated.
