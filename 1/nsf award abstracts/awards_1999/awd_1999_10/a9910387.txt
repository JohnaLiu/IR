This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring
              a parallel processing compute server for basic solid Earth geophysical research
              within Caltech's Seismological Laboratory.  The exact computer and
              configuration will be determined after considerable study of state-of-the-art
              scientific computers which are on the market during the first half of calendar
              year 2000. The machine will probably be comparable to a ten (10) processor SGI
              Origin 2000 with eight (8) Gigabytes of main memory with R12000 processors. The
              machine will  be used by a large group of faculty (including, but not limited
              to, Professors M. Gurnis, R. Clayton, D. Helmberger, and M. Simons),
              postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students actively engaged in processing
              massive data sets, modeling physical processes, and developing new
              computational algorithms. Research will span seismology, geodynamics, and
              geodesy. Studies within these areas of geophysics are rapidly advancing in step
              with advances in the performance of departmental-scale, parallel-processing
              compute servers. Some typical computational projects which will be allowed by
              this facility will include processing interferometric radar data to observe
              crustal deformation, modeling slow crustal creep and intense ground shaking
              following earthquakes, processing seismic reflection data from oceanographic
              cruises, processing global tomographic images of the whole Earth, and modeling
              thermal convection within a spherical shell.
