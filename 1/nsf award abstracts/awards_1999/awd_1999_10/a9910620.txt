Workshop: Sustaining and Valuing Natural
              Resources

Environmental goods and services have fueled economic growth and
              serve as the basis for human well being. Yet much of this "natural capital" is
              unpriced, and therefore frequently undervalued, leading to its use or
              degradation in excess of that which would best serve the public good. Methods
              for proper valuation of these services are needed, together with an increased
              understanding of the biogeophysical factors that form their bases. Natural and
              social scientists have been collaborating on these questions from over a
              decade, but these collaborations have been isolated and limited. At present
              there is no common understanding among scholars as to the most important
              unanswered questions or most fruitful directions for future research. This
              interdisciplinary workshop will assess the current literature on natural
              capital and its valuation and identify the most crucial gaps in that
              literature. This assessment is intended to serve as the basis for a larger
              effort in 2000 that will produce a comprehensive research agenda for the
              field.
