This award supports a three year collaborative research project
              between Professor Gordon Grau of the University of Hawaii at Manoa and
              Professor Masaaki Ando of Hiroshima University in Japan.  The researchers will
              be undertaking a study on the control and actions of prolactin in teleost
              fishes.  Prolactin (PRL) is known to have effects on electrolyte balance,
              growth and development, reproduction, metabolism, behavior, and the immune
              system.  Fish present excellent models for the study of action of PRL and the
              control of PRL release.  Identifying and characterizing prolactin-releasing
              peptides (PRPs) from four phylogenetically diverse fish species are the
              scientific goals of this proposal.  This will involve:  1) the effect of PRPs
              on salinity adaptation;  2) the effect of environmental salinity on the
              expression of PRP mRNA and on circulating PRP and PRL levels;  3) the
              interaction of PRPs with other factors that influence PRO release; and  4) the
              mechanism(s) through which PRPs stimulate PRL release.  The four fish to be
              studied are the tilapia, carp, eel and mudskipper.

The project brings
              together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and
              research capabilities.  The results of the experiments should significantly
              advance the understanding of PRL release in fish and provide insights into PRL
              release in vertebrate species in general.  This research advances international
              human resources through the participation of postdoc and graduate students. 
              Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our
              base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and
              cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research in
              scientific journals
