Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of a new electronic system for remote
              monitoring of small-bodied animals.  This method offers two distinct advantages
              over existing methods.  First, a substantial increase in spatial detail; the
              system will perform nonstop tracking of individuals to within tens of
              centimeters in three dimensions.  Second, it will be extended to continuous
              monitoring of many individuals simultaneously.   Data recorded will ultimately
              comprise a series of xyz coordinates taken every few hundred milliseconds for
              each one of the individuals being monitored within a few hundred meter radius. 
              The system will have a modular design that permits expandability to cover
              larger areas.  These new capabilities are derived from a novel twist on the
              conceptual design of the Global Positioning System while using existing
              technology to realize this design.

The development of this monitoring system
              will allow fine grained recording and analysis of behavior of small-bodied
              animals in natural settings.  This level of resolution will provide previously
              unavailable information of significant value for studies in the fields of
              Animal Behavior, Population Biology and Ecology.
