Abstract    :
              9910195
Novel finite element method is developed for stochastic structures,
              i.e. those involving random elastic and/or geometric properties and subjected
              to random or unknown-but-bounded loads. The method is based on micromechanics.
              Existing literature covers well the cases when the coefficient of variation of
              involved random parameters, functions of fields are small, as well when the
              stochastic fields are defined phenomenologically. The experimental evidence
              necessitates for generalization of existing techniques for the case of moderate
              or large coefficients of variation. The only procedure existing today to tackle
              these problems is the Monte Carlo Method. Here, some effective numerical
              methods will be developed that do not necessitate the use of the Monte Carlo
              Method. Novel variational principles are established to deal with shear beams,
              bending of beams and plates, deformation of shells. The developed techniques
              constitute useful and efficient numerical techniques for both small, moderate
              or large variation of stochastic parameters, in conjunction with them being
              based on micro-mechanics. In addition, for the first time, the convex finite
              elements will be developed for problems where probabilistic information is
              unavailable.
