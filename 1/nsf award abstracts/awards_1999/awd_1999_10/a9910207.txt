The project implements a discipline-based, beginning teacher
              program for middle- and high-school science teachers in San Mateo County and
              Oakland school districts.  Building on an 18-month "proof of concept," the
              project demonstrates that linking beginning teacher programs to content-rich,
              learning institutions and existing teacher learning communities provides new
              teachers with critical content, coaching and acculturation at this pivotal
              stage in their development as teachers.

The project will work with 200
              beginning teachers (teachers will be drawn from San Mateo County and the
              Oakland Unified School District) and 150 experienced teachers new to the
              Exploratorium's teacher institutes over five years.  One hundred Exploratorium
              Teacher Institute alumni will serve as in-class coaches and mentors.  Another
              375 teachers, who represent the pool from which future mentors will be drawn,
              will receive advanced training.  The project includes both formative and
              summative evaluation components.   The induction model will be disseminated to
              90 professional developers around the country.
