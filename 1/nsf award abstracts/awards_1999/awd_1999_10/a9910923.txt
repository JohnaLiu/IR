The proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell
              system is a possible replacement for the internal combustion engine in vehicles
              if its performance and efficiency is improved.  Of the performance controlling
              components in the PEM fuel cell, the membrane and the cathode are the two most
              influential components.  The conductivity of the membrane, which is directly
              proportional to its hydration state, determines how much current can be passed
              through the cell.  The oxygen reduction rate at the cathode is the limiting
              step and determines how much current can be generated.  During operation, the
              effect of proton migration causes water molecules to move from the anode to the
              cathode resulting in membrane dehydration at the anode side and electrode
              flooding at the cathode.  The membrane dehydration and electrode flooding
              problems are localized, resulting in nonuniform current distribution and result
              in localized hot spots and stress on the membrane that could lead to cell
              failure.

A segmented PEM fuel cell will be built to detect and identify
              operating conditions and variables that control the current distribution and
              the root causes of spatiotemporal current density behavior.  The cell will be
              used to identify operating conditions, electrode characteristics and flow field
              designs that lead to nonuniform current distribution and the general
              spatiotemporal behavior of PEM fuel cells.  The results will be used to
              determine optimal operating conditions and to develop electrode and flow field
              designs that will result in higher efficiency and performance PEM fuel cells.
