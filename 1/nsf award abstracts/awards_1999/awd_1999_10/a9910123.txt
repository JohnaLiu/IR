Self-Organization of Semi-Arid Landscapes: Tests of
              Optimality Principles

Terrain and vegetation are tightly coupled. Landscape
              formation involves slow erosional processes that create a template of water and
              energy resources to which vegetation responds rapidly. Optimization theory
              explains terrain as a self-organized system that uses minimal energy to move
              water and sediment.  Long-range connections limit how far a managed system can
              be deflected from its natural state.  Using natural and experimental
              landscapes, the investigators will test three hypotheses: (1) plants and
              microbial crusts affect fluvial and hillslope processes that feed back to
              regulate resource supply; (2) plant responses to resource availability create a
              ratchet at the community level that controls responses to droughts; and (3) the
              optimal plant community either maximizes productivity or minimizes the energy
              embodied in networks of interacting plants.  the PIs employ parallel
              computation to link models of resource supply, terrain, and plant growth.  This
              synthetic work applies generally to disturbance, succession, and responses to
              land use changes and will involve inter-disciplinary training of undergraduate
              and graduate students in ecology and computer engineering.
