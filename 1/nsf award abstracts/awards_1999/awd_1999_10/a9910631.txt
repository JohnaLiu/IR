Abstract    :
              Parallel Kinematic Machines (PKMs) contain architectures that attempt to combine
              the dexterity of robots and the accuracy of machine tools.  An
              American-European PKM forum was held in Milan, Italy in August-September 1998,
              funded jointly by the National Science Foundation and its counterpart of the
              European Union.  It provided a forum for presentation and discussion of the
              latest research efforts and future research challenges by American and European
              researchers from academia, industry and government labs. The Year 2000 PKM
              Conference will be a follow-up of the previous PKM forum. It will be held on
              September 13-15, 2000 in Ann Arbor, MI, in order that the conference
              participants can also attend the International Machine Tool Show that will be
              held in Chicago right before the PKM conference. The topics covered by this
              conference will include both theoretical developments and industrial
              applications such as computer aided configuration tools for the design and
              optimization of various parallel and hybrid kinematic structures; light-weight
              and precision mechanical joints; novel linear and rotary actuators; advanced
              metrology techniques and strategies; new control concepts; and CAD/CAM systems
              for trajectory planning. 

This conference will be the first one on PKMs held
              in the United States.  It is expected to be of significant interest and value
              to researchers in the field of machine tools, robotics, mechanisms, and
              multi-body dynamics & control, and of practical importance to the future
              developments and applications of PKM technologies.
