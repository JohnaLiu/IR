Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks support for a project to recover ice cores from the summit
              ice fields of Mt. Kilimanjaro, in order to obtain a high-resolution record of
              tropical climate, including ENSO-related phenomena and the African monsoon. The
              project will recover four 100-m ice cores to bedrock from three summit ice
              fields and analyze them for a variety of constituents; produce a map of the
              extent of ice from aerial photographs; use these data to place 20th century
              climatic and environmental changes in eastern Africa within both a longer and
              larger perspective.
