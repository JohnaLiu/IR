PROJECT SUMMARY

This is a project that brings together appropriate persons
              representing academia, industry, and professional societies to discuss issues
              of diversity in the engineering workforce at a national workshop.  The outcome
              of the workshop, including action-oriented recommendations, will be published
              and formally presented at the 2000 ASEE meeting in St. Louis.  Identifying
              approaches for improving recruitment, retention and success rates of minorities
              and women in engineering will be a top priority of the project.
