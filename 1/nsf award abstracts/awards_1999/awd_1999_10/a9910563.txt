Abstract    :
              This is a study of reaction mechanisms and chemical pathways relevant to the
              homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) process.  Single-component fuels
              and mixtures of 2 to 5 species of unsaturated hydrocarbons are investigated
              using the Drexel Pressurized Flow Reactor Facility and associated
              instrumentation for gas analysis.  A suite of analytical techniques is used to
              identify and quantify the stable reaction intermediates and product species. 
              Specific objectives include the production of detailed chemical species
              evolution profiles as functions of fuel size and structure, oxygen
              concentration, temperature, and pressure; the isolation of relevant pathways
              and mechanisms; the development of detailed and reduced chemical kinetic
              models; and the exploration of possible chemical methods for controlling the
              HCCI process.

The homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine,
              proposed 20 years ago by Japanese engineers, is under active consideration for
              next generation vehicles.  It offers the potential for both high efficiency
              (high gas mileage) and clean burning (low NOx and particulates).  However, the
              process is not well understood and real systems have problems of stability and
              fuel optimization.
