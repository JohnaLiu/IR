              Abstract

This award renews support for a collection of unicellular marine
              algae, including both eukaryotic and bacterial strains that make up
              phytoplankton in the open oceans.  The collection also includes a  few
              multicellular algae (seaweeds).   Most of the collected strains were first
              isolated from samples taken in benthic regions of the Pacific and Atlantic
              oceans.  However, a significant fraction of the collection is made up of
              isolates from polar regions that have optimal growth within a few degrees of
              freezing.  

The collection provides samples to academic and industrial
              researchers at a modest charge, and provides help in identification of unknown
              strains and training in culture techniques on an occasional basis.  Because of
              the importance of phytoplankton in the productivity of the ocean ecosystems,
              the collection is an important resource for biologists and oceanographers.  The
              collection is the largest and only comprehensive collection of marine algae in
              the US.
