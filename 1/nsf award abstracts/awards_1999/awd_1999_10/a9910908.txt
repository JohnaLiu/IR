The rheological
              behavior of such complex fluids as fiber suspensions, crystal polymers, etc.
              are important in the paper, food, and pharmaceutical industries.  Linear
              solutions exist for a number of these flows, but for many applications,
              nonlinear terms become important and must be included.  It is proposed to study
              thee nonlinearities in the context of four situations highlighting
              viscoelasticity, fluid inertia, electrical double layer interactions, and
              fiber-fiber adhesion:

i) Oscillatory linear flows do not show any change of
              orientation from one cycle to the next: there is, however, a cumulative drift
              of orientation when non-linear terms appear.  Three such cases will be studied
              for a wide range of amplitude and frequency.
ii) The case of fibers suspended
              in fluids emphasizes the inertia forces when considering their length (high
              Reynolds numbers), but viscous effects may dominate when the fiber diameter is
              the relevant dimension (Reynolds numbers near unity).  A slender body theory
              will be developed and applied to the case of a single rotating fiber in a
              Couette flow.
iii) Electrically charged rods are expected to interact with
              ions of opposite charge, with their resulting effect on the rod orientation. 
              Experiments are planned to test the PI's earlier theoretical work on
              electoviscous effects.
iv) Dense suspensions bring together viscous effects
              (fluid-body surface interaction) and Columbic friction laws (body-body
              contact).  Such interactions will be studied with special attention to adhesive
              fiber-fiber contact.
