Abstract    :
              This project addresses the continuance of the highly successful "NSF-Catalyzed
              Innovations in the Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratory" symposia that have been
              held at the Fall Meetings of the American Chemical Society.  Since 1985, the
              College Science Instrumentation Program (CSIP), the Instrumentation and
              Laboratory Improvement (ILI) program, and the current Course, Curriculum, and
              Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) program have funded a variety of projects to
              improve the laboratory equipment, and hence, laboratory instruction at colleges
              and universities throughout the United States and its Territories.  In 1987,
              the National Science Foundation first sponsored the symposium "NSF-Catalyzed
              Innovations in the Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratory" at the Fall Meeting of
              the American Chemical Society.  Symposia have been held annually since this
              time and are now well established and attended by both recipients of grants and
              scientists concerned with their own laboratories who wish to incorporate
              changes and improvements into their curricula.  These symposia provide the
              opportunity to disseminate the results of the best projects and to provide a
              dialog between educators.
