Microbial biofilms are common coatings on mineral surfaces in
              many environments and are known to sorb metal ions such as Pb(II). However,
              little is currently known about the chemical form(s) of these metal ions at a
              molecular level, their spatial distribution in the biofilm, and the mechanisms
              by which the biofilm affects metal ion sorption on mineral surfaces. This
              multidisciplinary project will address these and related issues through
              laboratory studies of Pb(II) sorption on biofilm-coated surfaces of aluminum
              and iron (hydr)oxides and quartz as a function of several solution variables.
              The molecular-scale speciation and spatial distribution of Pb(II) in biofilms
              grown on these surfaces will be studied using synchrotron-based x-ray and
              electron microscopy methods. In addition, we will use infrared spectroscopy to
              study the effects on Pb(II) uptake of the common inorganic ligand PO43- and
              several organic ligands that are dominant functional groups on bacterial
              surfaces and biofilm exopolysaccharides. Burkholderia cepacia, an aerobic
              gram-negative bacterium that readily forms biofilms under nutrient-limited
              conditions, was chosen for the initial phases of this work. Our choice of
              system variables will be guided by the results of our ongoing studies of Pb
              speciation in several Pb-contaminated tailings at Leadville, CO and soils in
              northern France. The role of extracellular phosphate and of intracellular
              ortho- and polyphosphate metabolism in the biofilm in producing Pb-phosphates
              will be explored. Our approach starts with relatively simplified model systems
              and systematically adds some of the complexities of natural systems. The
              ultimate goal of this work is to develop a fundamental understanding of some of
              the factors that control the geochemical cycling (and potential
              bioavailability) of Pb and other metals in aquatic environments.
