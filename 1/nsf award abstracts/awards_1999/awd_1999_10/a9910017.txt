This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              materials research involves Randall D. Kamien, a postdoctoral researcher and
              graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania and Brigitte Pansu and her
              students at the University of Paris, South.  The investigators propose to study
              liquid crystalline phases and phase transitions, in particular, a state of
              matter known as blue phases with smectic order.  Theorists and experimentalists
              are studying blue smectic phases for their dramatic structure, high degree of
              structural order, and mechanical properties.  The collaboration brings together
              U.S. theorists with French experimentalists.  It will focus on the structure
              and properties of blue phases and the smectic structure.  New phases of matter,
              including smectic blue phases, are important for their use as templates for
              nano- and micro-fabrication of technologically interesting materials, including
              those with optoelectronic properties.

This award represents the U.S. side of
              a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the U.S. 
              investigators, postdoctoral researcher, and graduate students.  The CNRS will
              support the visits of the French researchers to the United States.
