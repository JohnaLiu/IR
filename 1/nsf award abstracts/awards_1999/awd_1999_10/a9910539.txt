Funding from this grant will allow us to obtain experimental
              equipment to augment the existing experimental petrology laboratory at the
              University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Department of Geology and Geophysics.
              Specifically, we will acquire an externally heated TZM pressure vessel system,
              including furnace and pressurizing equipment, which will extend the current
              capabilities of the experimental laboratory by increasing the conditions
              attainable to ~1250 degrees celsius while containing up to ~2000 bars of
              pressure.  This addition will enable us to study basalt and andesite
              compositions at upper crustal conditions.  A primary goal of the establishment
              of this new apparatus will be to further the monitoring goals of the Alaska
              Volcano Observatory (AVO) by contributing valuable information on processes
              that control and initiate eruptions.  In particular, we will be able to
              contribute valuable studies that focus on understanding processes that control
              explosive and effusive volcanism, such as crystallization rates, crystal
              dissolution studies, bubble nucleation and growth, and the use of mineral
              reactions to monitor magma ascent. In addition, constraints on bubble
              nucleation and growth processes could be very important for understanding the
              nature and causes of volcanic tremor. Thus, we will be adding a new dimension
              to the work of AVO by furthering our understanding of the processes that
              control arc volcanism.
