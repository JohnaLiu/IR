Gruissem
This award supports Wilhelm Gruissem and two post-doctoral
              students from the University of California-Berkeley in a collaboration with
              Joerg Kudla of the Department of Botany at the U. of Ulm, Germany.  The project
              will focus on clarifying the roles of the enzymes that participate in
              chloroplast mRNA metabolism.  The collaboration will examine a novel
              chloroplast RNA processing complex developed by the German group.  The research
              effort will take advantage of the reagents and the expertise that are being
              developed in both laboratories to investigate interactions between the proteins
              and other components of chloroplast RNA.  This work will have implications for
              identification and characterization of genes in Arabidopsis, and is relevant to
              practical applications such as the engineering of plants for agriculture.
