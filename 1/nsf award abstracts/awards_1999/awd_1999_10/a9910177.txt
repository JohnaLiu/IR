Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the preparation of thioquinones,
              chalcogenofulvenes, chalcogenofulvalenes, nonclassical thiophenes and
              thiophene-based macrocycles.  Results will lead to a better understanding of
              the properties of such compounds and subsequent application to the design of
              organic materials in the area of synthetic metals, superconductors and
              materials with nonlinear optical properties.

With this award, the Organic
              and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues support for the research of
              Professors Michael P. Cava and M.V. Lakshmikantham of the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Alabama.  Professors Cava and Lakshmikantham
              will focus their work on the preparation of compounds that have the potential
              to lead to application in the areas of synthetic metals, conducting polymers
              and nonlinear optics.
