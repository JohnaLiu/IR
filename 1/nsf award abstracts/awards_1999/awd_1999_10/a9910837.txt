CALDER

The purpose of this award is to transfer funds to
              NOAA for the support of the International Arctic Research Center (IARC) at the
              University of Alaska Fairbanks.  IARC is expected to greatly enhance research
              in the Arctic and to facilitate research with many other organizations.

The
              IARC has identified eight broad themes as the framework of its program: (I)
              Detection of contemporary change, (II) Paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental
              reconstructions of past changes, (III) Interactions and feedbacks that affect
              change, (IV) Atmospheric chemistry of the arctic region, (V) Impacts and
              consequences of change, (VI) Solar influences on global change/space weather
              prediction, (VII) Climate change caused by tectonic activities, and (VIII)
              Integration of (I)-(VII) on a regional scale.
