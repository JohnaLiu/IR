Abstract    :
              The project will develop an Arctic-capable aerosonde, design an instrument
              package for it, field test the instruments, and collect data in the Barrow, AK
              vicinity.  The aerosonde is an autonomous aircraft that that builds on a design
              of a smaller platform that has flown in the Arctic.  The improved aerosonde
              will be more robust and have increased navigational as well scientific
              instrumentation than its predecessor.  The improved aerosonde will be able to
              fly over land and sea ice in order to make measurements of surface and
              near-surface properties that play a role in redistribution of heat in climate
              feedback systems.  The remotely operated aerosonde also allows measurements to
              be made without the need of humans entering a very dangerous environment,
              particularly during the most hazardous time of the year.  The aeorsonde will
              add an important access capability to Arctic research for a wide variety of
              atmospheric and surface properties studies.
