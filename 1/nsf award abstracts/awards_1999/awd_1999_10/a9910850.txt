This project involves a geophysical study of the northern Red
              Sea where the rift terminates into the sinistral Dead Sea transform and a slow
              spreading zone in the gulf of Suez. This area is a good natural laboratory for
              testing plate driven asthenospheric flow vs. bouyancy driven asthenospheric
              flow during continental rifting.  The relative importance of each of these
              processes is to be evaluated from a combination of surface manifestations
              (topography, geologic history, subsidence history of basins) and probing of the
              deep structure with a passive seismic array.  The seismic array, in turn, has
              two parts:  a basic crustal structure component to determine basic geometry and
              a shear wave splitting component to look at mantle flow.   The results of these
              studies will be combined with modeling studies (flexural modeling of rift
              flanks and mantle flow models) to develop a synthesis of the geodynamics.
