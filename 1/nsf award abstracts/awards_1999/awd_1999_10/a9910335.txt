Abstract    :
              The research project will establish a Long-Term Observatory at the North Pole by
              installing an oceanographic mooring, launching a drifting buoy, and conducting
              repeated oceanographic transects for temperature and salinity.   Oceanographic
              observations at the sites will be used to examine the long-term variability of
              the ocean and atmosphere in an area that has been undergoing rapid changes
              during the past decade. The current warming trend may presage a melting of the
              Arctic Ocean sea ice cover that has been predicted from Global Circulation
              Models as a response to global warming.  Determination of the variability and a
              possible long-term trend in ocean temperature or salinity is critical to
              understanding the oceanographic response to climate change in the Arctic Ocean
              and could provide compelling evidence to support other observations in the
              Arctic that global warming has already begun.
