Abstract    :
              

The objective of the work is to attempt to develop large area sensor arrays
              based on amorphous and/or polycrystalline GaN deposited at low temperatures on
              flexible substrates. This  technology will find applications in sensitive
              skins, capable of both tactile sensing and proximity photodetection of
              surrounding objects.  The expectation is that the work will  eventually  result
              in prototype patches of skin up to 6 inches in size with sensor arrays with
              densities on the order of 1000 sensors per cm2. This twelve-month project will
              focus on the fabrication, characterization, and modeling of GaN-based sensor
              arrays grown on different substrates.  Optical, mechanical, and electrical
              properties of these films will be analyzed, and test Schottky barrier device
              arrays will be fabricated to demonstrate pressure and photodetector sensor
              capability of this new materials system.
