This Americas Program award will support Dr. A. F. Ivanov,
              Pennsylvania State University, to travel to Chile, to plan a research project
              aimed at the study, both qualitative and numerical, of the global dynamics of
              solutions of delay differential equations and systems of such equations
              including questions of the existence, stability, dependence on parameters and
              bifurcations of periodic solutions, chaotic behavior, and global stability of
              equilibria.  Collaborators will be Dr. Manuel Pinto and Sergei Trofimchuk,
              Universidad de Chile.  The group also includes postdoctoral associates and
              graduate students.

The project  has the potential to solve several important
              theoretical problems, thus further developing the qualitative theory of the
              field, as well as the ability to bridge the development of theoretical issues
              with problems coming from actual applications. To achieve the goals of the
              project, the researchers will use various techniques and methods from the
              modern theory of dynamical systems, nonlinear analysis, qualitative theory of  
              ordinary and delay differential equations, computational  mathematics and
              perturbation methods.
