This project is designed to survey and test recently discovered
              archeological sites on Onekotan Island, Russia, in the northern Kuril Island
              archipelago.  In 1996, NSF- supported biologists surveying the biodiversity of
              the archipelago found this site in a short and deeply incise stream valley a
              few hundred meters from the current shoreline.  Detailed analysis of field
              photographs and remote sensing indicates that these may be  Ainu in origin, and
              date from the early-to mid-Holocene.  The current biological composition of the
              Kuril Archipelago is the product of a long biogeographic history, and humans
              are  expected to have played a significant role in this history as competitors
              and predators.  Archeological deposits also have the potential to preserve
              evidence of prehistoric flora and fauna that have been extirpated or gone
              extinct.  Two concurrent teams will systematically map and sample the Onekotan
              site in a first attempt to document the human and paleo-ecological history of
              the site and surroundings, the spatial organization of structures, and the
              local ecology and geology and geomorphology.  In addition, a second team will
              conduct a lower resolution archeological and geomorphological survey of the
              surrounding islands to generate contextual information about the broader
              settlement and biological impact of the Ainu.  This project is supported under
              the guidelines of the Small Grants for Exploratory Research program.
