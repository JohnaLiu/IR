Abstract    :
              This project will study the acquisition and development of ethnomedical
              knowledge in a small-scale peasant community in the Peruvian Andes. It focuses
              on how individuals acquire their medical culture throughout their maturation
              and development (from childhood to adulthood), and on the factors that shape
              that acquisition process. Both childhood medical knowledge/ understanding and
              how this changes as the child matures will be documented. The researcher argues
              that this case study of medical knowledge will provide a window onto the
              ontogeny of knowledge systems, specifically how childhood conceptual formation
              and cultural learning are transformed into adult ethnotheories. It builds on
              theories in anthropology, cognitive psychology and child development. Methods
              include a community census and health profile, health and illness interviews,
              and free-listing exercises, as well as surveys of medical behavior in the
              community.
