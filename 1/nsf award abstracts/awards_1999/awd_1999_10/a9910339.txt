Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the social movement that has emerged around
              AIDS-related issues in Brazil over the last 15 years, focusing on issues of
              political and social (health) mobilization at the community level. It will
              specifically examine 1) how this social movement reflects earlier AIDs
              movements, 2) how this movement has influenced social responses to the
              epidemic, 3) how state policies and programs have been shaped by the movement,
              and 4) how the epidemic itself has been affected by the movement. The team of
              researchers is composed to two Americans and two Brazilians, all experienced in
              studying AIDS issues. It will adopt a multi-sited approach, gathering data in
              five Brazilian cities. The research will contribute to efforts to combat the
              spread of the disease through effective social programs and policies. It will
              also contribute to our theoretical understanding of the processes inherent in
              the creation and efficacy of social movements.
