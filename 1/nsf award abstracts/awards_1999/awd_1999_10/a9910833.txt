The purpose of this proposal is to print, in English, the
              report on the Great Tangshan, China Earthquake, of the worst earthquake
              disasters in the history of the world, with several hundred thousand deaths and
              the destruction of the city of Tangshan and environs.

No detailed account of
              this earthquake has been published in English and, so far as is known only one
              such report has been issued in China.  As part of a collaborative effort this
              report has been translated into English in China and edited at the California
              Institute of Technology.  The funding requested in this proposal will enable
              the text and photographs to be put into suitable form for publication and a
              number of copies distributed to libraries at universities and cities that are
              concerned about earthquake hazards.  It is planned to have excerpts of the
              report published in suitable journals
