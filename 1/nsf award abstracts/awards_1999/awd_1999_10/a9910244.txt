Abstract    :
              	The MOZAIC data set, measurements obtained from instrumented commercial
              aircraft in Europe, provides new observations of water vapor and ozone that
              supplement the traditional radiosonde and ozonesonde networks.  Initial
              analyses suggest that the water vapor and ozone occur in multiple, relatively
              thin, layers in the troposphere.  Dr. Newell will explore whether this layering
              has an important influence on the large-scale dynamics of the troposphere and
              the thermal structure of the atmosphere, at least as compared with the effect
              of cyclones and anticyclones.  It is not obvious whether or not the layering
              should make a difference, but if it does, the implications for atmospheric
              modeling and atmospheric observational systems are enormous.  This preliminary
              study should provide a clear indication of whether the topic is worth pursuing
              in greater depth.  Support for this project is being provided as a Small Grant
              for Exploratory Research.
