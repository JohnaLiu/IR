ABSTRACT

OCE-9910635

This work will constrain the 234Th/POC ratio of
              marine particulate matter which has been used extensively to evaluate the
              export flux of carbon from the surface ocean. The objectives of the proposal
              are to collect various size fractions of organic matter from the Gulf of Mexico
              and to quantify the relationship between polysaccharide enriched marine
              aggregates and Th(IV) deficiency, to conduct laboratory experiments to
              investigate the interactions of Th(IV) with individual classes of organic
              compounds, and to construct an improved scavenging model of Th(IV) based on the
              nature of the organic material. Experimental and model results would be used to
              enhance the use of the 234Th/POC ratio for the determination of particulate
              organic carbon flux from the surface ocean.
