Abstract    :
              Speer/Tandon

Funding is provided to estimate large scale fluxes of mass, heat
              and salt in the 
North Atlantic using air-sea forcing data and WOCE (World
              Ocean Circulation 
Experiment) and historical hydrographic data . An inverse
              model will be used to 
estimate isopycnal and diapycnal fluxes together with
              their errors. The goal is to 
identify important processes controlling these
              fluxes. The PI's will also participate 
in the development of an atlas of
              Atlantic WOCE hydrographic data as part of the 
Analysis, Interpretation,
              Synthesis and Modeling phase of WOCE.
