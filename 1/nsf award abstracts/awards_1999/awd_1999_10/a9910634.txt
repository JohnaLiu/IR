This collaboration between the Council for Basic Education,
              two school districts, and the Center for Children and Technology at EDC,
              proposes a project to expand on the existing Schools Around the World (SAW)
              Project. SAW is an international professional development effort that focuses
              on improving science instruction in grades 4, 8 and 10 by having teachers
              examine student work.  SAW enables teachers to build on TIMSS by giving them
              concrete opportunities to examine student work in an international context (in
              additional to schools in the US, other participating countries include
              Australia, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Portugal and the
              United Kingdom).  In addition to supporting teachers in examining student work
              using international standards, the project will:  (1) conduct a formative
              evaluation that will guide subsequent project activities; (2) support a
              self-study on the use of interactive technology by SAW teachers and; (3)
              provide support  for the SAW Science Advisory Group to provide additional
              project guidance.
