This award supports a 3-year collaborative research project
              between Dr. Myung S. Jhon, Carnegie Mellon University, and Professor Hyung J.
              Choi, Inha University, Korea.  The proposed research aims to obtain
              breakthroughs in next generation hard disk drive (HDD) technology by
              investigating the fundamental mechanism of spreading of thin polymeric disk
              lubricant films on solid surfaces.  The ultimate goals of this project are to
              understand the role of lubricants on tribological performance and to establish
              molecular design criteria for lubricants in HDD systems.   Highlights of the
              study will include:

Performing SME (scanning microellipsometry) measurements
              while systematically tuning lubricant-surface interactions (lubricant end group
              functionality with various high- and low-surface energy surfaces),
Performing
              rheology and surface energy measurements, and
Developing novel theoretical
              methodologies.

This project will be performed in conjunction with Professor
              Choi's group at Inha University, Korea under the U.S.-Korea International
              Cooperative Science Program and will enhance the dissertation of PI's graduate
              student.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea
              Cooperative Science Program, which seeks to increase the level of cooperation
              between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of
              scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration
              on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea
              Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
