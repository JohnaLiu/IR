              Abstract

This supports a collaborative project whose principal objective is
              to model the origin of orbital- and millennial-scale  variability of ice
              sheets.  The project will focus on the inception of the North Hemisphere ice
              sheets the origin of the lOO-kyr ice volume signal in the absence of
              significant orbital forcing at that frequency ice-sheets dynamics that give
              rise to Heinrich events, and the role of ice sheets in D/O events, initially
              the project will focus on the North American ice sheets although the resulting
              model will be applicable to Eurasian ice sheets. The modeling strategy is
              guided by the overarching hypothesis that orbital- arid millennial-scale
              variability of ice sheets is strongly influenced by hydrologic, geologic and
              atmospheric conditions, and that the neglect of these conditions is a
              fundamental source of deficiency in existing ice-sheet models. The project will
              enhance an existing three-dimensional (3-ft) ice-sheet model developed by the
              participants by adding components to simulate ice streams ice shelves, and ice
              calving along marine margins and proglacial lakes Throughout the simulations,
              the geological record will be used to validate model output and guide model
              modifications
