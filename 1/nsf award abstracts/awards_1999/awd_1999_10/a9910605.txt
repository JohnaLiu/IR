Abstract    :
              The characteristics of data-distribution in high dimensional Euclidean space
              play a fundamental role in many areas of computer science, including database
              systems, pattern recognition and multimedia. Several basic data distribution
              properties, namely the angle, the distance and the radius properties in high
              dimensional Euclidean Space are being investigated. Both real data sets such as
              feature vectors for image data and synthetic data sets with distributions such
              as normal, zipf, self similar and fractal are being used to analyze these
              properties. A component of this research is to exploit these basic properties
              in developing efficient indexing schemes for nearest neighbor search.
              Significant performance improvement in search time in the proposed approach
              over those currently available is expected in this research. In addition, there
              is a plan to apply the indexing scheme to commercial image database systems.
