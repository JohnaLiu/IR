This 12-month project is to support planning for change in
              the teaching of middle school science and mathematics in ten school districts
              in northern Alabama.  Districts and the University of Alabama in Huntsville
              currently collaborate in the Hands-on Activity Science Program (HASP) at the
              elementary (K-6) level.  The intent is to plan in order to extend this reform
              in science to grades (7-8), and in addition to reform mathematics teaching and
              learning throughout the middle grades (6-8).
