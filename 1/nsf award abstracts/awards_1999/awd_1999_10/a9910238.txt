The Fourth International Conference on Forensic Statistics will be
              held at North Carolina State University on Dec. 5-8, 1999.  The conference is
              intended to allow statisticians, forensic scientists, lawyers, and scholars
              from related disciplines to discuss the many and varied uses of Probability and
              Statistics in legislative, administrative and judicial proceedings.  Forensic
              Statistics, the application of Statistics and Probability to legal matters, is
              an expanding field.  The current debates surrounding the presentation of
              evidence based on DNA profiling and epidemiological studies on the health
              effects of various drugs are just two examples.  There is a great need for
              statisticians to provide guidance to forensic scientists, and lawyers and the
              courts.  By bringing together statisticians, forensic scientists, lawyers and
              other scholars, this fourth international conference will further the
              interdisciplinary understanding of Statistics and Probability applied to legal
              matters.  The conference is the fourth in a series.  The previous conferences
              have been held at Univ. of Edinburgh and the Arizona State University.  Based
              on previous attendance, about 250 people are expected to attend the fourth
              conference.  This proposal provides funds to insure that U.S. participants will
              be able to hear and network with the best experts on this topic from this
              country and from abroad, and to provide access to the conference by graduate
              students, postdoctoral fellows, new researchers, and members of
              underrepresented groups.
