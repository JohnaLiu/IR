Abstract    :
                  This project will provide meteorological support for the Program for
              Research on Oxidants: Photochemistry, Emissions, and Transport (PROPHET) at the
              University of Michigan Biological Station in rural Northern Michigan.  The
              PROPHET program is a multi-investigator field study of photochemical processes
              involved in ozone formation.  An integrated sounding system will be deployed at
              the site, consisting of a Doppler wind profiler, a Radio Acoustic Sounding
              System, a GLASS rawinsonde balloon launching facility, and a local
              meteorological tower measuring pressure, temperature, humidity, wind and
              radiation.  This facility will provide routine vertical profiles of
              tropospheric winds, temperature and moisture throughout the troposphere in
              order to provide insight into the boundary layer dynamics at the PROPHET site. 
              Previous field intensives have demonstrated that understanding boundary layer
              dynamics is critical to the interpretation of chemical variability observed at
              the site.  The results of this study will provide key constraints on boundary
              layer transport processes occurring during the PROPHET 2000 and 2001 intensive
              field experiments.
