Abstract    :
              A Website, E-CEPT,  is being established  and administered to serve as an
              electronic network that coordinates and promotes undergraduate science/math
              education reforms. E-CEPT provides vital and efficient links across the 17
              geographically distributed NSF Collaboratives for the Excellence in Teacher
              Preparation (CETP), and among the more than 1000 science/math and science/math
              education faculty directly involved in the CETP programs. E-CEPT serves as an
              NSF gateway for directing any faculty interested in undergraduate science/math
              education reforms to high quality web-based information, including digital
              libraries.

The E-CEPT website contains two components: 1) a Portal and 2) a
              Forum. The Portal points users to other websites containing undergraduate
              science/math education reform information and materials, and features a search
              engine with access to a CEPT specific database continuously monitored and
              updated with links to frontline undergraduate science/math education reform
              information. The E-CEPT Forum promotes online interaction among CETP faculty
              and others interested in science and math teacher preparation reforms.
