Proposal Title: 	IUTAM Symposium: "Laminar-Turbulent
              Transition"
Proposal Number:		CTS-9910104
Principal Investigator:	William
              Saric
Institution:			Arizona State University

The IUTAM Symposium, to be
              held in Sedona, Arizona on September 13 - 17, 1999, will provide a significant
              opportunity to gain a worldwide perspective on the most recent findings and
              trends in this technically important field.  The objectives of the symposium
              are to deepen the fundamental knowledge of stability and laminar-turbulent
              transition in three-dimensional and compressible flows by providing a forum for
              discussions among leading scientists.
