This award supports a 2-year collaborative research
              project between Dr. Debra J. Wolgemuth, Columbia University and Dr. Kunsoo
              Rhee, Seol National University, Korea.  The proposed collaboration aims to
              explore the function of a human NIMA-like kinase, Nek2 during development of
              germ cells and other cell types.  The long-term goal of the research effort is
              to elucidate the genetic program controlling the mitotic and meiotic divisions
              of the germ line cells, with particular consideration of the evolutionary
              conservation of the regulation of these processes.

This collaborative
              proposal outlines genetic and biochemical experiments to begin to determine the
              role of Nek2, a putative mammalian homologue of aspergillus nimA.  The results
              can provide insight into the function of the NIMA pathway in mammalian meiosis,
              providing new understanding of the control of meiosis in higher organisms as
              well as information on the evolutionary conservation of cell division
              processes.

This project will be performed in conjunction with Dr. Kunsoo
              Rhee at Korea under the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program.  The
              collaborative interaction will provide for sharing of expertise and resources. 
              This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative
              Science Program, which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S.
              and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific
              information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on
              problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea
              Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
