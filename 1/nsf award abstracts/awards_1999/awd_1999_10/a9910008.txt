Feedbacks between species composition and ecosystem nutrient
              cycling in a California grassland

	This research investigates the effect of
              species composition on the cycling of nitrogen in soil of a California coastal
              prairie ecosystem. While most low-elevation California grasslands were formerly
              dominated by perennial bunchgrasses native to California, invasion by Eurasian
              annual grasses and forbs and, more recently, Eurasian perennial grasses, has
              caused a dramatic shift in their composition. We know very little about the
              consequences of this compositional change for the cycling and retention of soil
              nitrogen - an essential nutrient that limits plant growth in  these ecosystems.
              The aim of this study is to investigate whether differences in nitrogen uptake
              and use by native perennial grasses, versus Eurasian annual or perennial
              grasses leads to differences in nitrogen cycling and leaching in plots
              dominated by each type of grass. We are particularly interested in whether
              vegetation composition and soil nitrogen cycling interact to make communities
              resistant to further compositional changes.
