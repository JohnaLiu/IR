Abstract    :
              Funds are being provided for a three year, multi-institutional, two-transect,
              geodetic and seismic experiment across the Middle America Trench and Costa
              Rica, immediately above the seismogenic interface between subducting Cocos and
              overriding Caribbean plates. The PIs will operate GPS, leveling, and digitally
              recording seismometers on land and deploy ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs)
              offshore. The goal is to map the three-dimensional distribution and nature of
              the seismogenic zone, the locked or the partly locked plate interface that
              generates large earthquakes, for comparison to processes that control the
              distribution of seismicity and plate coupling. The imaging of the seismogenic
              zone will be enhanced in the Nicoya and Osa peninsular region because of the
              close approach of local coastline to the trench axis where the large
              earthquakes are generated.
