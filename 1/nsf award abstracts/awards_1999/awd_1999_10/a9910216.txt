The near shore
              environment is one of significant importance and complexity.  The importance
              derives from, among other factors, the transport of sediment; the complexity is
              related to the breaking waves and to the turbulent motions that induce and
              contribute to the transport of solid material.  The importance is attested to
              by the support of the Office of Naval Research and four independent programs
              within the National Science Foundation for the subject workshop.

The
              proposed workshop "Wave Breaking Turbulence", will involve a relatively wide
              range of experimental, computational and theoretical researchers.  It is
              expected that the presentations and interactions will lead to new insights as a
              result of bringing together this diverse of investigators. The net outcome will
              be made widely available on the World Wide Web as a service to the broader
              community.
