This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              materials research involves James L. Harden and Frederick MacKintosh of Johns
              Hopkins University and Jean-Pierre Munch of the Physics Institute of the
              University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg, France. The investigators will study by
              microrheology the viscoelastic properties of a diverse range of soft materials
              for which conventional approaches are inadequate.  The materials include newly
              discovered filamentous surfactant self-assemblies, concentrated colloidal
              suspension of anisotropic particles (clay gels and slurries), and micrometer
              sized complexes of lip membranes with attached two-dimensional biopolymer gels.
               The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in theory and
              propose to develop a theoretical framework for applications of microrheology. 
              This is complemented by French expertise in conventional rheology and
              preparation of biopolymer materials.  The project will advance our
              understanding of the microrheology method and its potential for studies of
              material properties (including living cells).

This award represents the U.S.
              side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for
              Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses
              for the U.S.  investigators and graduate student.  The CNRS will support the
              visits of the French researchers to the United States.
