This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              electrical and communication systems involves Kelvin Wagner and a graduate
              student from the University of Colorado and Jean-Louis Le Goulet of the
              Laboratoire Aime Cotton in Paris, France. The project, supported under a joint
              program of the National Science Foundation and the French National Center for
              Scientific Research (CNRS), will facilitate collaboration on the application of
              photon echoes to wide band signal processing.  The investigators will explore
              optical architectures that utilize temporal processing capabilities of
              photon-echoes in combination with the spatial transformations produced by
              spatial-spectral holograms. 

The U.S. investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise in optical architectures and systems.  This is
              complemented by the French investigator's research in device physics.  The
              researchers have developed this combined approach of photon-echo holograms with
              spatial holography.  The project will advance understanding of this approach
              and its potential to provide wider bandwidth, larger capacity, and higher
              resolution solutions to real-time signal processing.  The award will support
              the incremental costs of the international collaboration; that is, the travel
              to Paris, France and subsistence expenses of the U.S. investigators.  The CNRS
              will support visits to the U.S. by the French investigators.
