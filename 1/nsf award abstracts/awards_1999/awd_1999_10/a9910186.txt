Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to exploit the pressure sensitivity of
              antigen-antibody complexes for applications in biotechnology.  The specific
              goals of this research are: (1) to investigate in detail the effect of salt on
              several different antigen-antibody complexes to provide guidelines and
              strategies for modulating the pressure effect; (2) to investigate changes in
              the pressure sensitivity of a purely hydrophobic antigen-antibody complex,
              digoxigenin:26-10, using a number of mutants of the antibody as well as
              environmental perturbations; and (3) to determine suitable operating conditions
              for performing pressure 
elution separations.
