This award supports David Watkins, a graduate student, and
              an undergraduate student from the University of Nebraska in a collaboration
              with Joerg Mutterlose of the Department of Geology at the University of Bochum,
              Germany.  The collaboration will focus on several aspects of the response of
              Cretaceous marine phytoplankton (coccoliths) to the significant climatic
              changes that occurred in the Cretaceous period (65-144 million years ago). 
              They will examine responses on both a short-term (less than 100,000 years) and
              long-term (greater than 1,000,000 years) time frame.  For the short-term time
              frame, they will examine calcareous nannoplankton responses to orbitally-forced
              climatic shifts at selected places and times.  For the long-term time frame,
              they will examine the evolution of coccoliths during and following the
              mid-Cretaceous greenhouse interval to assess their response to global cooling. 
              The conditions of the Cretaceous period, with its interval of global greenhouse
              conditions, may serve as a model for the changes our present-day production of
              excess carbon dioxide might cause.
