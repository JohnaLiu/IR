Abstract    :
              Deep-sea hydrothermal vents at mid-ocean ridges are a locus for sustained light
              of sufficient flux to support non-solar photosynthesis.  These hydrothermal
              environments, thought to be likely places for the origin of life on Earth,
              produce a newly discovered bacterial species containing chorophyll and
              carotenoid pigments.  The PIs are systematically searching for phototrophs at
              deep-sea vents, within vent plumes, and in the water column overlying vents. 
              They focus on field sampling, shipboard analysis of pigments and determination
              of fluorescence properties of organic matter associated with sulfide mineral
              samples, microscopic evaluation of morphology and fluorescence properties of
              microbial cells in samples, isolation and cultivation of phototrophs, and
              identification of photosynthesis genes using PCR and DNA sequencing.  Studying
              phototrophs in their natural habitat, the PIs are conducting the first phase of
              a multi-disciplinary program characterizing the distribution, biochemistry, and
              ecological significance of phototrophs at deep-sea hydrothermal vents.
