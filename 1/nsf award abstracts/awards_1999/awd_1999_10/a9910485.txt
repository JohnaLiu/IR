	This award provides seventy-percent partial funding support
              for the acquisition of a thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) to be
              installed and operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at Northwestern
              University. The remaining support necessary to acquire the spectrometer system
              is to be provided by Northwestern University. The TIMS instrument will be the
              primary research tool for isotope geochemists at Northwestern University and
              researchers in the Chicago area from the University of Chicago, University of
              Illinois at Chicago, Notre Dame University, the Field Museum and Argonne
              National Laboratory.
