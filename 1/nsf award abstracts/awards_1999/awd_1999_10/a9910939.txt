Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for a conference titled "Environmental Technology
              for Oil Pollution" to be held in Jurata, Poland from August 29 through
              September 3, 1999.  The conference is being organized by J. D. Miller,
              University of Utah, and J. Hupka, Technical Unviersity of Gdansk, Poland.  It
              will be a sequel to the successful International Conference on "Analysis and
              Utilization of Oily Wastes", AUZO'96 held in September 1996 in Gdansk.  The
              conference has multiple objectives.  The first is to convene a truly
              multidisciplinary group of top researchers from academia, industry and
              government interested in environmental technology for the prevention and
              remediation of oil pollution.  The latest research and development findings
              pertaining to environmental contamination with oily phases will be considered. 
              The second objective is to provide a broad-based forum for these researchers to
              aid in cross-fertilization of current findings and ideas.  This grant will
              support transportation, lodging and registration costs of invited speakers from
              the United States.
