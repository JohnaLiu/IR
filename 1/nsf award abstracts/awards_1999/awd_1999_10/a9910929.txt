Abstract    :
              A workshop will be held on experimental and computational issues that pace the
              progress of large eddy simulation (LES).  This workshop will be held in
              Chicago, Illinois in October 1999.  Sponsorship will come from interested
              programs at the National Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the
              Air Force Office of Scientific Research, DARPA and the Center for Non-Linear
              Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
