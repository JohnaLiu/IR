This Americas Program award will support travel and related
              expenses for a group of 10 junior and senior mathematicians to participate in
              the Fifth International Conference on Difference Equations and Applications, to
              be held at the Universidad de la Frontera, Chile, on January 3-7, 2000.  The
              focus of the conference will be recent developments in difference equations,
              including chaos, control, and stability theory, numerical analysis, orthogonal
              polynomials, and mathematical biology and economics.  The program will include
              plenary lectures, invited talks, contributed papers, and panel discussions. 
              The meeting is expected to be attended by mathematicians from all over the
              world, but predominantly from Latin America. 

This activity will provide a
              unique opportunity for Latin American mathematicians to increase their
              visibility, network with U.S. mathematicians, forge linkages and collaborative
              relationships.  In addition, graduate students from both the U.S. and Latin
              America will be included, offering these future researchers an early experience
              in international research.
