Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research on the development of substrate/catalyst systems for the
              production of polycarbonates from carbon dioxide and epoxides, by Professor
              Donald Darensbourg of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University. The
              detailed mechanism of action of previously-developed zinc phenoxide catalysts
              using cyclohexene oxide as the substrate will be determined and used to design
              new catalysts. The use of double metal cyanides of zinc and cobalt or iron will
              be emphasized.

The goal of this research is to develop new and effective
              catalysts which can produce polycarbonates, a commercially important class of
              polymers, from carbon dioxide and readily available ethylene and propylene
              oxides. These catalysts will permit the direct utilization of the greenhouse
              gas carbon dioxide as well as replacement of  the current phosgene-based
              technology. Phosgene is highly toxic, and this process will be more
              environmentally friendly. A number of diverse students, both graduate and
              undergraduate, will receive broad training for both  industrial and academic
              careers.
