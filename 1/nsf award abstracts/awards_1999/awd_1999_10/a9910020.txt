This SGER project is designed to explore the use of
              students' science journals as a tool for staff development to improve formative
              assessment practices in science classrooms at the elementary school level.  The
              project would improve these assessment practices by:  (1) creating a conceptual
              and practical framework that can guide effective use of journals by teachers
              and students;  (2) creating a pilot teacher enhancement program that, by using
              science journals as an example of a classroom assessment, helps teachers
              reflect on and improve their formative assessment practices, and improve their
              own content knowledge; and  (3) exploring the impact of the implementation of
              the professional development program on teachers' formative assessment
              practices and on their students' performance.

Four to six teachers from the
              San Francisco School District will participate in this exploratory  project. 
              The evaluation of their professional development experience will focus on its
              impact by comparing the teachers' assessment practices, specifically the
              quality of their feedback, with student performance before and after the
              implementation of the professional development activity.  The design of the
              study will include data on the same teachers' journal feedback practices and
              their students' achievement in a prior study with no staff development
              intervention.  

The next step in this effort if the enhancement strategy
              proves successful will be to revise, implement, evaluate and disseminate this
              type of professional development in a larger context.
