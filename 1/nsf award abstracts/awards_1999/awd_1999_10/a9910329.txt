Abstract    :
              This largely ethnographic doctoral dissertation project explores how the borders
              between state, civic society, and families are being renegotiated in terms of
              who should provide resources for children in a decade of socio-economic
              upheaval. The project also examines parental gender roles within the family and
              how changes in the public roles of men and women affect mothering and
              fathering. How do parents negotiate their roles as husbands and wives, mothers
              and fathers, and what do they perceive their responsibilities to their children
              to be in a fast-changing society no longer dominated by a heavy-handed
              paternalistic state? How do parents interact with the more public sphere
              (schools, government agencies, community organizations, etc.) and how do they
              experience changing national family-related policies? Although researchers are
              actively exploring the experiences of women in the new post-Soviet era, very
              little attention is being focused on men, or on the family as a unit in the
              independent Russia of the l990s. This dissertation fills a significant gap in
              the literature on the post-Soviet world and contributes to larger theoretical
              debates on state-family relations, civil society building, and to comparative
              perspectives on family and gender. Material for this dissertation comes from
              eight months of in-depth interviewing and participant observation with twenty
              families living in the city of Saratov, Russia.
