Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to explore the use of microwave irradiation for
              the synthesis of a broad range of industrially important reactions.  Nitration,
              solid phase amide and oligopeptide formation and debromination are among the
              processes to be studied.  The project will be enhanced with the help of
              equipment, furnished on a temporary basis by industrial partners.

With this
              Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Drs. Ajay K.
              Bose and Maghar S. Manhas of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology
              at the Stevens Institute of Technology.  The focus of this project is to test
              the feasibility of using microwave irradiation to promote the "green" syntheses
              of a number of  important classes of compounds which have great interest to the
              fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  Industrial partners form a
              crucial part of the project.
