Abstract    :
              This project examines the linguistic properties and variation that occur
in
              Tactile American Sign Language, a variety of ASL used primarily by
Deaf-Blind
              adults having Ushers Syndrome  Type 1.  Ushers Syndrome Type
1 is a hereditary
              genetic condition in which a person is born deaf and
has retinitis pigmentosa
              (RP), a condition that causes a slow loss of
vision.  Many adults with Ushers
              grew up as members of the Deaf community
and used 'visual' ASL as their
              primarily means of communication.   Only later,
when their vision became so
              affected that they had difficulty seeing
ASL, did they switch to receiving 
              (American Sign Language) tactilely by putting their
hand on top of the
              signer's hand.

 Studying the Tactile ASL used by these Deaf-Blind adults
              provides a
unique sociolinguistic opportunity to examine linguistic changes
              that a
visual language (ASL) undergoes as the Deaf-Blind community adapts
              the
language to a tactile mode (Tactile ASL).  A large corpus of Tactile ASL
              data
will be created by videotaping interviews in which a Deaf-Blind adult,
              fluent
in Tactile ASL, interviews other equally fluent Deaf-Blind adults.
              Targeted
phonological, lexical, syntactic and discourse features will be
              examined for
variation and for correlations with internal and external
              constraints.
