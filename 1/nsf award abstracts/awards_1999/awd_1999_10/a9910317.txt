Abstract    :
              This award will provide funds for the partial support of an International Union
              of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) symposium on Scaling Laws in Ice
              Mechanics and Ice Dynamics, to be held in Fairbanks, Alaska, in June 2000.  The
              IUTAM is one of the components of the International Union of Geodesy and
              Geophysics (IUGG), a non-governmental international scientific
              organization.

The purpose of IUTAM symposia is to bring together researchers
              who have made significant contributions to the study of ice on various scales
              with those who have made significant contributions to the mechanics of
              heterogeneous media in other fields.  

Over the last few decades the
              analysis of composite materials has required the development of thermodynamic
              constitutive laws for materials comprised of discrete phases.  These principles
              may be applied to sea ice when viewed as such a material, i.e. its phases being
              multi-year floes, thick first-year floes, and ridges in a matrix of thin
              first-year ice, with varying degrees of damage, i.e. cracks and leads.  At this
              time there is no clear understanding of the range of applicability of different
              constitutive laws, and how the behavior of ice at small scales is linked to its
              behavior at geophysical scales.  A major objective of the symposium is to
              establish an organized approach to an understanding of the scaling problem in
              the ice dynamics and ice mechanics community through the exchange of ideas with
              leaders in the heterogeneous materials research community.
