Using reasonable assumptions based on
              laboratory data, atmospheric modelers calculate significantly more (factors of
              3 to 4) O (1S ) than is observed in aurora and the dayglow [Bucsela et al.
              1998].  Either there is a fundamental problem with the interpretation of
              previous experimental data or an important process (or processes) is (are)
              being neglected in current atmospheric models.  The proposed research addresses
              this problem using new experimental techniques.  The subsequent rates and
              pathways for loss of N2 (A) and production of O(1S) will be monitored directly
              using two-photon laser ionization to determine instantaneous changes in N2(A)
              and O(1S) concentrations and the branching ratios for O(1S) production.  These
              measurements will be made for temperatures near 300 K, which are appropriate
              for comparison with existing laboratory measurements, and in the ~ 400- 600 K
              range appropriate to the lower thermosphere.  Resulting data will be used (a)
              to determine reaction rate coefficients and O(1S) production efficiencies and
              branching ratios, (b) to identify the major mechanisms involving O(1S)
              production via N2(A) in the atmosphere, and (c) to provide critical input data
              for future airglow and auroral models.
