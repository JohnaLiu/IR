This grant provides partial funding for a comprehensive
              upgrade of the Northwestern University Department of Geological Sciences
              computer network.  The upgraded system will consist of a mix of SUN (or
              equivalent) workstations and Macintosh machines, with two servers providing
              computational and networking muscle for the distributed workstations, and the
              Macs providing easy-to-use graphics and computing capabilities to Department
              members and many undergraduate students.  A new large format color printer will
              also be purchased for production of posters, maps, and instructional figures. 
              This upgrade will benefit faculty and a multitude of undergraduate and graduate
              students involved in research programs in seismology, tectonics, mineral
              physics, planetary geophysics, and Earth surface processes.
