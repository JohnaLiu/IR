Abstract    :
              This award is to support U. S.  participation in the planning and attendance at
              the EUROMECH Colloquium 408 Interactive Dynamics of Convection and
              Solidification workshop to be held March 18-22, 2000 in Chamonix, France.  The
              workshop will bring together researchers  representing a spectrum of
              disciplines and research interests directed towards solidification processing. 
              The aim of the workshop environment is to consolidate the current
              understanding, and identify the key outstanding issues of the dynamics of
              convection and solidification.  Participants representing mathematical
              modelers, experimentalists, applied scientists and engineers will be invited
              from among international researchers working in these areas.
