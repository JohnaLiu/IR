Abstract    :
              Significant change has been observed in sea-ice conditions along the northern
              coast of Alaska.  These changes could represent alterations in the proportion
              of sunlight reaching the surface, in the quality and quantity of back radiation
              into the atmosphere from the surface, or in changes in heat content of land and
              coastal seas.  To provide basic information about the radiation inputs, losses,
              and heat fluxes, the proposed research would establish 5 sites near Barrow
              Alaska for detailed monitoring of solar and atmospheric heat fluxes as
              experienced by snow, sea-ice, near-surface waters, and land.  The five sites
              would include a tundra site, a lake site, a coastal lagoon, and two coastal
              ocean sites.  The goal would be to establish the local heat budgets, seasonal
              timing of key thermal events (snow melt, sea-ice melt, freezing onset, etc),
              and feedback mechanisms.  The approach would be to use moorings (lake and
              coastal sites) or permanent stations (tundra site) to obtained detailed
              information in time series, transect line sampling on frequent useful intervals
              to obtain spatial averages and variability, and aircraft sampling and satellite
              data to evaluate larger scale conditions in the vicinity of Barrow.
