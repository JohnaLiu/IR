Abstract    :
              This action is part of continuing cooperation between the NSF/CISE and the
              NLM/NIH to jointly fund activities of common interest.  The award will be
              directed to NLM managed competitions entitled, "Visible Human Project Atlas of
              the Head and Neck, and Visible Human Project Computer Imaging Tools", announced
              in RFPs NLM99-103DJH and NLM99-105/SLC.  The goals of the Visible Human Project
              Atlas of the Head and Neck solicitation is develop an educational, public
              domain-accessible web site, which in addition to offering new scholarly
              opportunities, may serve as a prototype for new educational applications based
              on the Visible Human Project data sets.  The goals of the Visible Human Project
              Image Processing Tools solicitation is to develop an application programmer
              interface (API) and initial implementation of a Segmentation and Registration
              Toolkit (SRT).
