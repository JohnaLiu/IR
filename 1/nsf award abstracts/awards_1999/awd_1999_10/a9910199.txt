Abstract    :
              This research project in the area of supramolecular chemistry targets the
              synthesis of catenanes and rotaxanes of increasing size and complexity.  The
              project seeks to employ thermodynamically-controlled synthesis of simple
              imine-containing rotaxanes and catenanes as proof of principle, and then of
              more complex interlocked molecules constructed around scaffolds of various
              geometries.  Supramolecular assistance will be gained from a well-established
              recognition motif -- namely that of the ammonium ion/crown ether
              interaction.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program supports the research efforts of Professor Fraser B. Stoddart of the
              University of California Los Angeles.  Professor Stoddart is exploring methods
              for the creation of molecules that can act as machines for a wide range of
              different technologies.  The present stage of the research seeks to establish
              assembly protocols based on control elements that are constituent parts of the
              final assembly.  This so-called thermodynamic control takes advantage of basic
              attractive and repulsive forces that guide the component parts of the assembly
              into the proper positions.
