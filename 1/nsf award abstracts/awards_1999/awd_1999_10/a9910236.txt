Abstract    :
              This project entitled "Actively Controlled Transport with Molecular Assemblies"
              is directed by Paul Bohn at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and is
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  This work focuses
              on the development and characterization of surfaces which, through controlled
              production, have microscale heterogeneity.  By controlling the geometry and
              surface free energy, molecular and supermolecular transport can be manipulated
              and studied.  The fundamental studies proposed here include (1) controlled
              adsorption of monolayer films that result in two-dimensional assemblies;  (2) 
              characterization of the structural heterogeneity; (3) improving the spatial
              control of molecular assembly; and (4) using controlled chemical potential
              gradients to direct surface motion.  Surface Plasmon Resonance, near-field
              scanning optical microscopy, and ac and dc resistivity measurements will be
              used to characterize the surfaces.  Dynamic manipulation of the chemical
              potential gradient will be used to affect motion of supermolecular species such
              as droplets on the surface.

This research will result in a deeper
              understanding of the controlled production of  two- dimensional surfaces  that
              exhibit both structural heterogeneity and chemical potential gradients.  The
              success of this research will have implications for understanding complex
              interfacial structures, which have applications in the studies of advanced
              materials, chemical sensing, and intercellular communication.
