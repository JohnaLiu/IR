Support is provided for young investigators and international
              speakers for the Centrifugal Materials processing Workshop to be held at
              Clarkson University from May 29 through June 2, 2000.  Scientific topics
              include directional solidification, centrifugal casting, spin casting,
              crystallization and precipitation from solutions, film deposition and coating,
              self-propagating high temperature synthesis, infiltration, atomization,
              separations, fluid mechanics, equipment and techniques.  Materials include
              metals, semiconductor and photonic materials, laser and optical materials, high
              Tc superconductors, ceramics and glasses, composites, particulates and protein
              crystals.  Emphasis is on developing interdisciplinary collaborative
              efforts.
%%%
Centrifuges have shown their utility in such diverse areas as
              protein crystal growth, composite manufacturing and powder production.  The
              meeting will serve as a catalyst for interdisciplinary and international
              collaboration on research and development in centrifugal materials
              processing.
