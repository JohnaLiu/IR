International Workshop on Perceptual Organization in Computer Vision:
              Assessing the State of the Community and Charting New Research
              Directions

This is a standard workshop award.  Perceptual organization can
              be defined as the ability to impose structural regularity on sensory data in an
              image, so as to group sensory primitives arising from a common underlying
              cause.  Such extraction of meaning from sensory input is an intelligent
              process.  Perceptual organization has long been studied by researchers in human
              vision and has begun to draw increasing attention in the computer vision
              research community because of its important potential.  This workshop will
              provide a valuable forum for researchers from both computer vision and human
              vision communities to assess the state of the art, identify basic research
              issues, and discuss promising new research directions in perceptual
              organization for computer vision.  The workshop will be held in conjunction
              with the 1999 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision to be held in
              Kerkyra, Greece.
