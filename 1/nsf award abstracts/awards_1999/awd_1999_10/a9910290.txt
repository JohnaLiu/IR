Abstract    :
              This project will develop an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) for use under
              the Arctic pack ice.  The AUV will be equipped with oceanographic instruments
              that will be used to collect data along a chosen bathymetric contour.  The
              instrument will send up data packages in a pod that melts through the ice and
              telemeters the data through a satellite to a base station.  Most of the
              development costs have been borne by National Oceanographic Partnerships
              Program.  This project serves as a proof-of-concept testing of the instrument
              package developed with that funding.  The scientific application of the
              measurement system is to collect data to study the warm Atlantic layer
              incursion into the Arctic that has caused a fundamental change in Arctic
              circulation and may be linked to a larger Arctic warming.  The AUV will provide
              a means for collecting data remotely and quickly under the pack ice where other
              systems require human intervention at a much greater logistical cost and risk
              in a very hazardous environment.
