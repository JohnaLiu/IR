Abstract    :
              The research analyzes the interaction of knowledge, behaviors and values in
              environmental decision making.  Data are collected from two sites where Native
              American and majority culture populations share a habitat but conflict over
              resource use:  The Wolf River area of Wisconsin and the Lowland Maya forest
              region of Guatemala.  Studies integrate formal modelin techniques from
              psychology, anthropology and sociology to show that:  (1) people share
              cultureal models of the environment to a surprisingly detailed degree; (2)
              these mental models inform and predict actual behaviors, with measurable
              ecological consequences; and (3) individual and cultural differences in models
              are motivated by different patterns of resource valuation.  Research findings
              are expected to establish: (4) a first approximation of ecological cognition
              across cultures, (5) a cognitive dimensin to stimulate new research on how
              people decide to manage common resources; and (6) a comprehensive basis for
              conflict-resolution negotiation that involves understanding the relations
              between environmental cognitions, behaviors and values
