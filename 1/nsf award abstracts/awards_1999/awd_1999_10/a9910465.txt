This project will investigate the perceived motivations for and the
              biological fitness consequences of male coalitional violence ("warfare") in an
              indigenous group in eastern Ecuador. The Waorani (a linguistic isolate) are a
              famously warlike group of egalitarian tropical forest horticulturalists. They
              have experienced extraordinarily high levels of mortality due to internal
              violence, the effects of which remain prominent in the life histories of people
              still living. The level of participation in male coalitional violence varies
              substantially form man to man, thus affording the possibility of studying both
              the perceived motives for participation in violence and the reproductive
              consequences of varying levels of bellicosity, an important issues in
              contemporary cultural anthropology. The research will test a number of
              hypotheses concerning the relationship between individual motivations for
              warfare and reproductive advantage. Methods include the collection of life
              histories, social network data, reproductive and household histories, and
              individual motivations from 400 Waorani male and female adults. The project
              will contribute to our understanding of the motivations and consequences of
              warfare.
