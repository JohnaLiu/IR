Abstract    :
              This project will investigate high rates of diabetes among the Pima, a group of
              Native Americans living on the Gila River reservation. The researcher will
              focus on why the Pima participate in or reject biomedical treatment and
              prevention, and how they seek to combine biomedicine with their own desires for
              self-determination and cultural identity. As the incidence of diabetes is on
              the rise in this population, biomedical treatment participation and completion
              continue to be poor. The research will document Native American health seeking
              behaviors and illness interpretation in a context of pluralistic therapy
              systems, as well as in terms of their specific social and political economic
              situation in American society. The research will focus specifically on Pima
              women (mothers and pregnant women); of women over age 35, approximately half
              have diabetes.
