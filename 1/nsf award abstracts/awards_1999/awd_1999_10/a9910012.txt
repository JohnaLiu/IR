This award supports Harry Tuller and two graduate students
              from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a collaboration with Holger
              Fritze of the Department of General Metallurgy at the Technical University of
              Clausthal, Germany.  The collaboration will develop novel gas sensors that can
              be used to investigate the transport mechanisms in high-temperature
              piezoelectric materials.  The knowledge gained will make it possible to improve
              essential properties of resonator devices necessary for stable operations and
              operations independent of oxygen pressure.  The concept proposed is novel and
              innovative and brings together several new research results on different
              materials that could lead to sensors having application to a wide variety of
              applications.
