Abstract    :
              This linguistic anthropology project will examine the impact of circular
              migration on female gender norms. It specifically analyzes how migrant women of
              Martinique are presented with two different models of gender in their home
              (island) and receiving communities (France), and how these models (and
              associated identities) are negotiated.  Research will center on language use as
              an indictor and measure of how women think about and actively construct their
              gendered identities and relations.
