Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the relationship between language change and
              ecological change among Quechua/Spanish speakers of the Peruvian Andes. The
              project will specifically compare Quechua toponymic vocabulary (names and kinds
              of places) with production ecology (land use patterns), examining how language
              may reflect some of the behavioral changes in environmental management. It
              tests several hypotheses concerning the relationship between traditional versus
              introduced toponomy and cropping practices (indigenous and introduced). It also
              examines the relationship between indigenous and introduced toponomy and
              conservation versus "exploitation" ethics of the environment.
