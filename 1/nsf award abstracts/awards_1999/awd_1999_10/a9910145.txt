This project proposes to install ten portable arrays,
              each consisting of eleven 3-component, short-period seismographs, in the
              Marlborough region at the northern end of the South Island of New Zealand to
              measure both crustal thickness and anisotropy in the crust and uppermost
              mantle.  The goal is to quatify the offset of the Moho below strike-slip faults
              and to determine whether shear has occurred over broad regions in the lower
              crust near such faults.  Such shear is a predicted consequence of ductile
              deformation in the lower crust lying beneath blocks of upper crust that move
              with respect to one another along strike-slip faults and mantle lithosphere
              that is sheared over a laterally wide zone.  Conversely, if faults passed
              directly from the upper crust into the lower mantle, little or no anisotropy
              would be present in the lower crust, and possible an offset of the Moho would
              occur where strike-slip faults pass into the mantle.  The Marlborough region of
              New Zealand is an excellent location because:  it is active and large
              displacements have occurred on the faults; there is abundant local intermediate
              depth seismicity to provide high-frequency body waves with steep angles of
              incidence; and preliminary results indicate anisotropy, although not its depth
              range.
