Abstract    :
              This project will examine the different cultural meanings and experiences of
              menopause for women of different socioeconomic classes in Oaxaca de Juarez,
              Mexico. It will be contextualized within Mexican constructs of gender and
              aging, and how these vary by social class (urban poor, working class, and
              middle elite). The research will utilize survey data on 500 families from a
              previous NIMH study for constructing her class samples. Methods include
              participant observation, archival research, structured and unstructured
              interviewing, focus groups, and clinical encounter observations. The project
              will contribute to theory on how culture (social class) variably shapes
              biomedical conditions and manifestations.
