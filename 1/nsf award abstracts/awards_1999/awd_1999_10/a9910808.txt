Abstract    :
              This project entitled "Shuhai Wenyuan Classical Digital Database and Interactive
              Internet Worktable" will create a digital corpus and internet-based resources
              to allow world wide use of  seminal texts from China's classical period.   The
              project will involve bringing together specialist in Classical Chinese
              language, thought, and culture, and information technologists to produce tools
              and access methods to materials that have thus far been limited to a select
              group of students and scholars.  By doing so the project intends to open up new
              areas of study and research for learners of all ages.

The data content will
              be freely available via the web and offer Chinese texts, English examples,
              cultural and philosophical notes, grammar notes, and a search engine designed
              for a variety of tasks.
