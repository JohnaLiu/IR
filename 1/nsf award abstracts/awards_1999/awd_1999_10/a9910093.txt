Abstract    :
              This project is a contribution to a coordinated attempt to understand the
              interactions of biological and physical dynamics by developing relationships
              among the evolution of the antarctic winter ice and snow cover, biological
              habitat variability, and the seasonal progression of marine ecological
              processes.   The work will be carried out in the context of the Southern Ocean
              Experiment of the Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics Study (Globec), a large,
              multi-investigator study of the winter survival strategy of krill under the
              antarctic sea ice in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay on the western side of the
              Antarctic Peninsula.

The objective of this project is to make a quantitative
              assessment of the small scale temperature and salinity structure of the oceanic
              surface layer in order to study the effect of stratification and turbulence on
              the biochemical and biological processes under the winter sea ice.

The water
              masses on the continental shelf off Marguerite Bay consist of inflowing Upper
              Circumpolar Deep Water, which is relatively warm, salty, oxygen-poor, and
              nutrient-rich.  In winter atmospheric processes cool and freshen this water,
              and recharge it with oxygen to produce Antarctic Surface Water which is
              diffused seaward, and supports both a sea ice cover and a productive
              krill-based food web.  The modification processes work through mixing
              associated with shear instabilities of the internal wave field, double
              diffusion of salt and heat, and mixing driven by surface stress and convection.
               These processes will be quantified with two microstructure profilers, capable
              of resolving the small but crucial vertical variations that drive these
              processes.
