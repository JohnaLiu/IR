A two-day workshop is planned for october 14 and 15, 1999 at the
              Key Bridge Marriott Hotel in Arlington, VA. The workshop will discuss a new
              direction in developing artificial "sensitive skin" intelligent sensor arrays
              along with software and data processing capabilities.  The sensitive skin will
              enable moving machines to function in unstructured and changing environment. 
              This technology could become an integral part of the hardware base for the next
              generation of information technology.
