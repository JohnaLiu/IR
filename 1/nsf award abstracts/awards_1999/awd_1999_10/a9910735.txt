This transfer of funds from NSF to NOAA will provide
              partial support for an international partnership conference and support
              meetings related to implementation of the Russian Federation's National Program
              for Action in the Arctic (NPA-Arctic). The focus of NPA-Arctic is to protect
              the Arctic marine environment from land-based pollution.  The plan focuses on
              environmental issues related to policy, management, monitoring, public
              awareness, and enhanced institutional capability. The objectives of the main
              Partnership Conference currently being organized is to seek partnership for
              activities and financial support for proposals that are required for successful
              implementation of the NPA-Arctic.  Oversight and organization are being handled
              by the Advisory Committee on the Protection of the Sea (ACOPS).  Other U.S.
              federal agencies in addition to NSF are providing partial support.***
