Abstract    :
              The investigator will conduct an exploratory, short-term study of the
              possibility that the solar neutrino flux exhibits a modulation at the (synodic)
              solar rotation frequency. Based on analyses carried out to date, the
              investigator strongly suspects that such modulation exists and that the
              amplitude is sufficient to explain the neutrino deficit. The main effort is to
              test the procedures that have been used, to re-analyze neutrino and related
              data by new techniques, and to examine possible theoretical interpretations of
              the effect if it is proved to exist. If the effect is present there will be
              major consequences to the fields of particle physics, solar physics, and solar
              terrestrial relations.
