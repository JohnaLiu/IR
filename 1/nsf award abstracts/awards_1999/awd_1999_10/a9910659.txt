This award supports a planning visit by Peter Edmunds and a
              student to Australia to initiate work with Dr. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, School of
              Biological Science, University of Sydney on the coupling of physiology and
              physical effects to the demography of tropical reef corals.  The PI proposes to
              spend three weeks in Australia developing a collaboration to study associations
              between the physiology and demographics of reef corals on the Great Barrier
              Reef.  In Australia, the PI will spend a week at the University of Sydney
              followed by two weeks in the field at One Tree Island.  The PI and student,
              together with Australian colleagues, will conduct trial experiments and collect
              preliminary data on the population sizes of possible experimental species on
              the reefs of One Tree Island, in anticipation of preparing a full collaborative
              research proposal.

The topic is important to basic research in coral reef
              and other coastal systems, and the proposed planning visit should lead to a
              continuing collaboration.
