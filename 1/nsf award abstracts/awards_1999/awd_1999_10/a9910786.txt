This award provides funding to the
              NSF-funded Engineering Research Center (ERC) at Mississippi State University on
              Computational Field Simulation for exploratory cross-collaborative research
              among three groups to advance the state-of-the-art in simulating and
              visualizing the effects of a large earthquake on an urban region.  This
              proposal will create a distributed simulation framework that integrates
              earthquake ground motion modeling by Carnegie Mellon University's Quake Project
              CMU-Quake, modeling of structural and infrastructure systems by the Pacific
              Earthquake Engineering Research Center at the University of California,
              Berkeley, and the advanced computational and visualization methods by the ERC
              on Computational Field Simulation at Mississippi State University.  This
              proposal links together geophysicists, earthquake engineers, computational
              scientists and engineers, and computer scientist.  This integrated model will
              allow investigation of the relationship between earthquake fault parameters and
              distribution of various types of damage, ranging from individual components and
              structures to collective damage to particular classes of structures.  This
              model will provide policy-makers and emergency response agencies with a more
              complete picture of the effects of a major earthquake on a densely populated
              region than is possible with current regional damage models.
