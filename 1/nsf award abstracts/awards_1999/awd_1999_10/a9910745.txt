Abstract    :
              Now in its fifth year, the Rocky Mountain Teacher Education Collaborative
              (RMTEC) has achieved a record of sustained change in preservice teacher
              preparation and undergraduate teaching and learning in mathematics and science.
              The purpose of RMTEC is to (1) improve the preparation of preservice teachers,
              with emphasis on restructuring, reforming, and developing innovative curricula
              and instructional methods for teaching mathematics and science; (2) develop
              collaborations among the primary partner institutions, community colleges, and
              school districts; (3) recruit and retain women and ethnic minorities for
              teaching careers in mathematics and science. Three of the higher education
              partner institutions, in collaboration with teachers and administrators of
              school districts throughout Colorado, propose to conduct a three-year summative
              evaluation of the RMTEC project. This evaluation is organized to address
              assessment in three overarching areas: collaboration, institutionalization, and
              student outcomes.
