Abstract    :
              Engineering - Civil (54)
It is widely agreed that success as an engineer
              requires sound technical knowledge. However, employers are increasingly
              emphasizing the importance of non-technical skills to include effective
              communications, team leadership, a dedication to lifelong learning, and a
              commitment to the sharing of this knowledge through mentoring. If these skills
              are to be cultivated in future engineers, they must first be instilled in their
              instructors, who themselves must be able to serve as role models. Engineering
              faculty must therefore have a specific and distinct non-technical skill set.
              Ironically, unlike K-12 teachers, critical education skills are not taught to
              most college faculty. This void is the motivation for the American Society of
              Civil Engineers (ASCE) continued commitment to the Excellence in Civil
              Engineering Education (ExCEEd) Teaching Workshop (ETW). This project improves
              upon the Teaching Teachers to Teach Engineering (T4E) workshop previously
              conducted at the US Military Academy, West Point and supported by NSF. ETW is
              an evolution of T4E designed to benefit a larger population of faculty. It is
              an intensive, one-week workshop for civil engineering and civil engineering
              technology faculty with less than five years of teaching experience. An
              important component is the inclusion of observers/assessors from other
              engineering professional societies, which ensures the quality improvement of
              each future workshop and which holds the potential to disseminate this activity
              to other engineering organizations interested in offering faculty development
              opportunities to their membership.
