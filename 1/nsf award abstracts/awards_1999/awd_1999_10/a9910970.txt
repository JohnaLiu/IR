"The American Woman
              Engineer: Breaking the Mold"

This project is designed to build on and extend
              the Principal Investigator's earlier study, carried out between 1993 and 1995,
              under a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Jr. Foundation.  As part of that study,
              the PI and his collaborator interviewed 75 American women engineers and
              consulted several archival collections with the intention of writing a history
              of American women engineers.

These interviews included questions about early
              memories of schooling and of mentorship; of parent and peer reactions to
              interests in math, science and engineering; of the pleasures and difficulties
              of engineering work; of the pleasures and difficulties of maintaining social
              and familial relations. When the interviewees recalled experiencing
              discrimination the PI and his collaborator explored this subject in depth as
              well.

This earlier study led the PI and his collaborator to the view of
              women engineers as people who shattered multiple sets of stereotypes in several
              historical periods: stereotypes about feminine behavior, stereotypes about
              feminists and stereotypes about the nature of engineering as a profession and
              about technology as a part of culture.  

The current project comprises a
              series of interviews with two groups of women that were underrepresented in the
              earlier series of interview subjects:  women currently over the age of 60 and
              women who are currently engineering students or who have just taken their first
              jobs. The PI and his collaborator will also visit several archival collections
              which containing materials about women who entered engineering work between the
              two World Wars and about the inclusion or exclusion of women from engineering
              education. During the grant period the PI also intends to begin writing the
              manuscript.
