This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration
              involves Germano Iannacchione of Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Jean-Louis
              Gallani of the Institute for Physics and Chemistry of Materials, Strasbourg,
              France.  The investigators propose to study magnetic phases that are found in
              unique organic molecular magnets.  The project extends current work on the
              creation of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of organic radicals and organic
              superlattices.  LB films provide special opportunities for creating novel
              two-dimensional magnets.  The U.S. team at Worcester Polytech will perform
              high-resolution ac calorimetry in the temperature range of 1. to 4.2. K on
              samples created by the French team in Strasbourg.  Calorimetry studies will
              provide details about the transition into a ferro phase. 

This award
              represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National
              Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living
              expenses for the U.S. investigator.  The CNRS will support the visits of the
              French researchers to the United States.  The collaboration will advance
              understanding of low dimensional magnets and how to use Langmuir-Blodgett
              deposition technique to create materials possessing features of spin
              electronics.
