Abstract    :
              This project is an attempt to understand the interactions of biological and
              physical dynamics by modeling the spatial distribution of antarctic krill, a
              small crustacean that forms dense aggregations or patches on the small scale. 
              The spatial distribution of these patches appear to depend on the advance and
              retreat of the sea ice, the three dimensional movement of water masses from
              small scale turbulence to the dynamics of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, as
              well as on food supply and predation pressure.  Prior work has shown that
              physical processes dominate on the larger scale, while biological processes
              dominate on the smaller scale, but the relative importance of the two as a
              function of scale has not been investigated systemically.

This work will be
              carried out in the context of the Southern Ocean Experiment of the Global Ocean
              Ecosystem Dynamics Study (Globec), a large, multi-investigator study of the
              winter survival strategy of krill under the antarctic sea ice.

The problem
              of accurately representing patchiness in a circum-antarctic model is that of
              properly representing effects that occur on a scale that is not resolved in the
              model.  The approach that will be used here is to first study a detailed model
              that can resolve the scale of krill patches and can help to analyze and
              understand the observations that will be made in the Experiment.  These results
              will allow us not only to make a more quantitative estimation of the errors
              involved, but also to improve the parameterization of krill distributions in
              meso-scale and basin-scale models of the Southern Ocean.
