This award supports Konstantin Mischaikow and students
              from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and participants from the Jet
              Propulsion Lab and the California Institute of Technology in a collaboration
              with Michael Dellnitz of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciences at
              the University of Paderborn, Germany.  The collaboration will develop new
              efficient numerical methods which allow for the reliable approximation of
              invariant manifolds and the rigorous verification of desired trajectories for
              spacecraft.  Among the objectives of the research are the development of a
              set-oriented algorithm for the computation of rigorous coverings of invariant
              manifolds Hamiltonian systems; development of techniques for the real-time
              visualization of the computed objects; and incorporation of the developed
              techniques into the software tools already developed at Paderborn and the Jet
              Propulsion Lab.
