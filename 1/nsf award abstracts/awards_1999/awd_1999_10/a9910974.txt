This three-year award supports U.S.-France collaborative
              research in neuroscience between the research groups of David Sulzer at
              Columbia University and Francois Gonon at the University of Bordeaux.  The
              project addresses the development and testing of new techniques to measure
              chemical neurotransmitters.  Brain function relies on release of chemical
              neurotransmitters.  Classical techniques to measure neurotransmission, such as
              liquid chromatography and postsynaptic recording, are inadequate for studying
              their real-time release of neurotransmitters.   Recent work by the U.S. and
              French groups employs carbon fiber microelectrodes to record transmitter
              release in the brain at the usec level.  This approach is particularly well
              adapted for the neurotransmitter dopamine.  The study will focus on the release
              of dopamine in the striatum.

The U.S. investigator brings to this
              collaboration methodology for recording neurotransmitter release at the quantal
              level in brain neurons.  This is complemented by the French's investigator's
              work on real-time detection of neurotransmitter release using carbon fiber
              electrodes, a technique which he developed.  Their collaboration will advance
              understanding on how neurotransmitter release is regulated in the brain and on
              brain function in general.  Experimental results may ultimately provide the
              technology to measure transmitter release.
