Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to use concepts from fractals to solve long-standing
              database problems in query optimization, spatial databases, and temporal
              databases. Moreover, it introduces the powerful tools of fractals, chaos and
              non-linear systems for additional applications, like forecasting, time-sequence
              data mining, buffering and prefetching, for large database applications.
              Typical questions can be as diverse as: "In a real set of points, like cities
              of the world, estimate the average number of neighbors within 10 miles from New
              York city" in a GIS (Geographic Information System) setting, and "Given the
              history of past disk page requests, what can we forecast for future requests"
              in a disk scheduling setting. Deriving estimated answers to such questions is
              notoriously hard, because of the non-uniformities that real datasets exhibit.
              Although unrealistic, the uniformity and independence assumptions have been
              traditionally used in past efforts, mainly because of their mathematical
              tractability and because of the lack of anything better. The current project
              proposes to replace them with the assumption of self-similarity, leading to
              much more accurate estimates. Current estimates with the uniformity assumption
              lead to up to 179 per cent error; with fractals, we expect the error to go down
              to 10 per cent or less. This will allow for more accurate selectivity
              estimations, yielding more realistic answers to queries and more successful
              query optimization, and better disk scheduling, improving the performance of
              database and disk systems.
