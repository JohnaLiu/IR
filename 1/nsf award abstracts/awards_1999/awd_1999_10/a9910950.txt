Abstract    :
              The project will examine the structure and dynamics of the polar thermosphere
              and its linkages with the active phase of the Solar Cycle in 2000-2002.  The
              research includes optical observations of polar auroral arcs from circumarctic
              sites across the polar cap.  In addition to data gathering at ground stations
              in Alaska, Denmark, Canada, Norway and other sites, satellite information will
              be used to study solar storms in the polar ionosphere and thermosphere.  A wide
              variety of instruments will be used to measure the intensity and variability of
              solar energy entering Earth's atmosphere during a period of intense solar
              storms for the next several years.  The results of this project will be
              important to understanding the role of solar storms in disrupting satellite and
              radio communications.
