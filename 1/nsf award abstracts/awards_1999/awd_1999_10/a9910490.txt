This grant provides partial support for upgrading the
              Geophysics computer network in the Department of Geological Sciences at the
              University of Colorado.  Specific equipment to be purchased will include three
              Sun Ultra series workstations, a 300Gb RAID mass store system, two Mac G3
              computers and two field-grade laptop computers.  This upgrade will support a
              variety of active reserach programs in seismology, GPS geodesy and remote
              sensing.  Specific investigations include continuing studies of the
              lithospheric structure beneath the U.S. Rocky Mountains which rely on
              computationally intensive inversions of very large (100's of Gb) PASSCAL
              portable seismic array data sets and continuous and campaign-style GPS
              investigations of current plate motions surrounding collisional zones between
              the Indian and Eurasian plate, subduction zones around the circum-Caribbean,
              and zones of active rifting in East Africa.
