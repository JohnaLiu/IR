This is a planning visit proposal proposed by Dr. Samuel
              James, Maharishi University of Management.  Dr. James requests funds for a 15
              day planning visit to the Philippines to survey earthworms (Annelida:
              Oligochaeta).  Earthworms are of significant ecological and economic importance
              to mankind, but some earthworms are difficult to identify.  He will use this
              opportunity to examine a problem of species identification, to gather
              preliminary information for submitting a proposal to Systematic Biology panel,
              and to examine an urgent problem associated with a detrimental earthworm
              species in the famous Ifugao rice terraces on Luzon, the Philippines.
