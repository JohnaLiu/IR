Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to continue the documentation of Yuma, the
              language of the
Quechan Indians, spoken on the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation in
              Winterhaven, California.  Its
immediate goals are (i) to compile a dictionary
              of Yuma, and (ii) to translate and analyze a large
body of Yuma texts
              collected by A.M. Halpern in the 1970s.

A dictionary of Yuma will fill a
              longstanding gap in the Yuman linguistic literature and
provide data for
              ongoing comparative Yuman and Hokan research as well as for research
              into
specific problems in Yuma phonology and morphology. As it will include
              data collected in the
1930s, the 1970s, and at the turn of the 21st century,
              it will be a rich source of data on language
change.  A volume of analyzed
              texts will not only serve as a database for the study of Yuma
syntax and
              discourse but also preserve a body of ethnographic and linguistic data that
              would
otherwise be lost within a generation.  Both volumes will be useful in
              typological and areal
linguistic studies and in anthropological and
              ethnographic research.

Beyond academia, a dictionary and volume of texts
              will be invaluable resources for
teachers in Quechan schools and for tribe
              members interested in maintaining and strengthening
language skills and
              cultural knowledge.  When the language is no longer spoken, these volumes
will
              remain as a record of Quechan linguistic, literary, and cultural heritage.
