This grant provides partial support for the acquisition of a
              stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) system to be housed in the
              Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Missouri-Columbia.  The
              Principal Investigator, Cheryl Kelley, is a relatively new addition to the
              Department and together with colleagues, will use the instrument in research
              aimed at investigating environmental cycling of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen,
              both past and present.  The SIRMS will be equipped with both an elemental
              analyzer and gas chromatograph front-end, allowing for analysis of compound
              specific stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes that will aid in elucidating
              pathways of carbon flow through aquatic microbial communities.  The SIRMS will
              also allow for stable isotopic analysis of biogenic carbonates in
              paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic investigations and can be configured for
              the automated introduction of CO2 liberated from carbonate samples.  This
              instrumental system will be heavily used in the training of both graduate and
              undergraduate students in this growing Department.
