This award supports Marek Perkowski and a graduate student
              from Portland State University in a collaboration with Bernd Steinbach of the
              Department of Information Sciences at the Technical University of Freiberg,
              Germany.  The collaboration will focus on decomposition as a way of
              simplification of the description of data.  Machine learning is the process of
              examining classified data cases in order to build a classifier that can
              correctly classify future data.  The new method to be developed here will make
              use of the German group's expertise in creating and implementing decomposition
              programs and the U.S. group's experience in creating machine learning programs.
               Combining the two methodologies will create a unique multi-application
              decomposer that will be able to solve problems that are not yet solvable.
