	This award provides funding for a project to calibrate the
              production rates of Be-10 and Al-26 in quartz due to cosmic ray muon capture.
              Accurate knowledge of these production rates is important to researchers in the
              areas of Quaternary geology, paleoclimatology, and geomorphology who depend on
              measurements of the concentration of these isotopes to determine the age of
              exposure to the atmosphere of rock surfaces. Muon capture production rates will
              be calibrated by analyzing quartz for Be-10 and Al-26 in samples of granite
              taken from a 6-meter depth profile, which will give a clear separation between
              spallogenic and muon capture production.
