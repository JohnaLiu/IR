This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              plant biochemistry involves Asim Esen and David R. Bevan of Virginia
              Polytechnic Institute and State University and Bernard Henrissat and Mirjam
              Czjzek of the Macromolecular Biology Laboratory in Marseilles, France.  They
              will collaborate on the crystal structure and the structure-function
              relationships of beta-glucosidases a widespread plant enzyme.  The
              investigators have chosen maize beta glucosidase and white mustard myrosinase
              as model systems because these enzymes exhibit subtle substrate and bond
              specificity.  Using domain-swapping, site-directed mutagenesis and x-ray
              crystallography in combination with 3-D structure determination and modeling,
              the investigators propose to understand the mechanism of the enzymes' substrate
              and bond specificity.

The project takes advantage of French expertise in
              crystallography and will advance fundamental understanding of the biochemical
              and physiological processes in which beta glucosidases are involved.  Because
              these enzymes are found in many plants, basic knowledge about their structure
              and function may have practical importance to enzyme engineering in general and
              to applied research on biomass conversion, plant productivity and defense.  
              This award will support the incremental costs of this international
              collaboration; that is, the travel to Marseilles, France and subsistence
              expenses of the U.S. investigators, postdoctoral researcher and graduate
              students.
