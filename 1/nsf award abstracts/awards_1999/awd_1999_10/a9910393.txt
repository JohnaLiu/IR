Abstract    :
              This project will examine the effects upon Atlantic circulation and climate of
              the Pliocene closure of the Central American Seaway (Isthmus of Panama). 
              Faunal assemblage of planktic foraminifera and stable isotopes in both benthic
              and planktic foraminifera will be analyzed in a depth transect of ODP cores
              from the North Atlantic at intervals of 3000 years between 5.3 and 2.3 Ma.  The
              project will text the hypothesis that closure of the isthmus resulted in a
              strengthening o the Gulf Stream and increase in intermediate or deep water
              formation.
