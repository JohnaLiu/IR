The
              ICTAM 2000 meeting in Chicago will be an opportunity for cross fertilization of
              ideas, techniques, clarification of fundamental issues, networking, etc. within
              the extremely broad community encompassed by the designation: "Theoretical and
              Applied Mechanics."  The large number of participating programs (12) speaks to
              the breadth of interests that will be present at this meeting.
