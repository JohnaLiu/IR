Kausel
This award supports Eduardo Kausel and two students from the
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a collaboration with Stavros Savidis
              of the Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Geoscience at the Technical
              University of Berlin, Germany.  The project will focus on the study of
              non-linear, inelastic behavior in the subsoil as it affects the interaction
              between soil and structures.  Of particular interest is the response of soils
              under seismic loads, which are known to cause important inelastic deformations.
               The collaboration between the U.S and German groups will create a critical
              mass on the topic of non-linear soil-structure interactions and will lead to
              improvements in practical methods for modeling those interactions.
