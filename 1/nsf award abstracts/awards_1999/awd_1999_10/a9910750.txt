Abstract    :
                        Strategic Control of Time-Sharing Performance

Time-sharing or
              dividing attention among multiple tasks is an
important component of many
              activities such as driving and
piloting.  But time-sharing performance is
              often observed to
degrade from single-task performance level.  A
              better
understanding of the capability and limitations of time-sharing
is
              germane to the understanding of the nature of attention.  It
is also most
              useful for designing and evaluating many daily
activities and many
              occupational tasks such as maintaining
aircraft stability while navigating in
              the cockpit.  For example,
the risk of motor vehicle collision was found to be
              four times
higher when using a cellular telephone than when not regardless
of
              whether hand operations were involved.  This implicated a
central limitation. 
              The proposed research aims at a better
understanding of the strategic control
              of time-sharing.

Two major theoretical views on the nature of the
              limitations of
time-sharing are examined.  Bottleneck theory hypothesizes
              that
attention acts as a bottleneck along the information processing
system,
              necessitating multiple tasks to be processed
sequentially.  Resource theory
              hypothesizes a finite amount of
attention that is allocated among the
              time-shared tasks such that
when performance of one task improves due to
              increased priority,
the other is likely to degrade.  Traditionally, the
              psychological
refractory period (PRP) paradigm has been used almost
              exclusively
to test bottleneck theory and the relative-priority
              manipulation
has been used to test resource theory.  The proposed
              research
will examine the extent to which the divergent conclusions
              drawn
from these tests are constrained by the methodologies used.
Converging
              evidence from a combination of the two paradigms
should lead to a deeper
              understanding of the nature of attention
and its effects on performance.  The
              results should add to an
already rather rich dual-task database.  The proposed
              converging
operations and methodological refinements should provide a new
and
              powerful arena for further understanding of the attentional
mechanism.  This
              understanding has profound implications on
activities that are as mundane as
              calling home while driving or
as complex as landing a packed 747 in severe
              weather.
