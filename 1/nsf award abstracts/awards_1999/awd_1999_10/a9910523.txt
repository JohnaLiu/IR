The long range goal of this research is to obtain an understanding of
              the biochemistry and origin of one-carbon metabolism.  The research in this
              project will determine the enzymology of the interaction of two isozymes of
              methyl-cob-amide:coenzyme M methyl-transferase (MT2-A and MT2-M).  The MT2
              isozymes function in separate C-1 metabolic pathways in Methanosarcina barkeri,
              in which they catalyze methyl group transfer from different corrinoid (B12)
              protein substrates to the thiol group of coenzyme M.  The relative amounts of
              the two isozymes differ 200-fold in M. barkeri grown on methanol versus
              trimethylamine.  Studies are designed define the molecular basis for the
              functional specificity of MT2 isozymes in different metabolic pathways by
              characterizing the interactions of the MT2 isozymes with different corrinoid
              proteins.  The specific aim of this study is to identify the structural basis
              for MT2 isozyme-corrinoid protein substrate specificity by engineering the MT2
              genes to produce defined structural changes in both MT2 isozymes.  Wild type
              and modified MT2 proteins will be used in physicochemical, kinetic and
              thermodynamic studies to characterize their interactions with different
              corrinoid protein substrates.  At the completion of this project the protein
              structural determinants responsible for the metabolic specificity of the MT2
              isozymes will have been identified.  Studies on this B12-dependent system will
              be an important contribution to the understanding of C-1 metabolic
              specificity.
This project will further our understanding of the evolution of
              metabolic specificity, of the enzymatic transfer of single carbon units, and of
              a novel enzymatic zinc-based catalytic mechanism of methyl group transfer.  The
              enzymes are derived from methanogenic Archaea, but apparently have analogous
              enzymatic counterparts in all other forms of life thus far studied.
