This award supports John Prince and Kathleen Virga from the
              University of Arizona in a collaboration with Gert Winkler of the Department of
              Electronics and Information Technology at the Technical University of Ilmenau,
              Germany.  The collaboration will focus on electromagnetic interactions between
              embedded passive components in mixed-signal systems.  Mixed-signal systems have
              radiofrequency or microwave functional blocks along side digital blocks.  The
              research combines the complementary expertise of the U.S. and German groups. 
              The German group is strong in the fabrication of low-temperature cofired
              ceramics, while the U.S. group is strong in modeling and simulation.  The U.S.
              results will be used by the German group in developing simple models which can
              be embedded in a design framework and used in radiofrequency or microwave
              circuits which can function in a mixed-signal environment.
