This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              applied mathematics involves Basil Nicolaenko, Harindra Fernando, Alex Mahalov
              and a graduate student from Arizona State University, and Igor Mezic of the
              University of California at Santa Barbara.  The French team is led by Marie
              Farge at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, France and includes French
              researchers from Grenoble, Cachan, and Lyon.  The objective of the
              collaboration is the study of geophysical flows in fully developed turbulent
              regime by means of numerical simulations using adaptive pseudo-spectral and
              adaptive wavelet methods.  Several numerical codes for different models in two
              to three spatial dimensions, with and without rotation, stratification and
              transport of passive and reactive scalars will be developed.  

This award
              represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National
              Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living
              expenses of the U.S. investigators and graduate student.  The CNRS will support
              the French researchers' visits to the United States.  The collaboration is
              interdisciplinary. U.S. and French teams represent expertise in applied
              mathematics, fluid mechanics, meteorology and chemistry.  The project will
              advance understanding of code development for environmental flows that have
              applications in air pollution, ozone depletion (in Antarctic, for example), and
              have a role in inertio-gravity waves in the stratosphere.
