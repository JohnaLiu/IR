This award supports Zhiqiang Cai, a post-doctoral and a graduate
              student from Purdue University in a collaboration with Gerhard Starke of the
              Department of Mathematics at the U. of Essen, Germany.  The project will focus
              on developing a new, accurate, robust, and efficient least-squares finite
              element method to solve nonlinear elasticity problems.  Such techniques would
              be useful in applications such as buckling of plates, large deformations of
              hyperelastic materials, and Navier-Stokes problems.  The collaboration combines
              unique expertise on both sides, with the U.S. side among the leaders in the
              analysis of least-squares finite element methods for partial differential
              equations and the German side experienced in numerical techniques.  Interest in
              this area of investigation is currently very strong in the research community,
              and a new way to solve the difficult problems being attacked in this research
              would be a boon to many disparate fields.
