	This award provides fifty-percent partial funding support to
              improve the long baseline crustal strain measuring systems at the Pinion Flat
              Observatory operated by the University of California at San Diego. The
              university is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the
              instrument upgrade. Changes in the shape of the ground (crustal deformation)
              are caused by plate tectonics and create stresses in the earth leading to
              earthquakes. Such deformations are small and occur over relatively long periods
              of time. They are precisely measured using laser interferometric strainmeters
              developed by the PI and his group.
