Abstract    :
              This project is a contribution to a coordinated attempt to understand the
              interactions of biological and physical dynamics by developing relationships
              among the evolution of the antarctic winter ice and snow cover, biological
              habitat variability, and the seasonal progression of marine ecological
              processes.   The work will be carried out in the context of the Southern Ocean
              Experiment of the Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics Study (Globec), a large,
              multi-investigator study of the winter survival strategy of krill under the
              antarctic sea ice in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay on the western side of the
              Antarctic Peninsula.

There are several aspects to this project: One is the
              collection, analysis, and archiving of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler
              (ADCP), and Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) data in order to characterize
              mesoscale circulation features and the regional hydrography.  Another is to
              develop an accurate and fully validated model of tidal currents in Marguerite
              Bay.  A third is to provide a data set of small-scale processes such as shear
              instabilities, tidal stirring, mesoscale eddies, and double diffusion, that are
              required for the effective parameterization of the vertical diffusivities of
              heat, salt, and nutrients.  The results of this project will provide a unified
              data set that satisfies the data requirement of the coordinated chemical and
              biological studies which will link water column and sea ice processes with the
              biology of krill and its predators.  The results further will help to link
              these winter observations to similar observations made in summer and elsewhere
              around Antarctic in the international context of the Globec program.  The
              overall objective is to develop a comprehensive ecosystem model that will test
              our understanding of the system, determine its sensitivities, and to provide an
              organizing mechanism for integrating the Southern Ocean Globec
              observations.
