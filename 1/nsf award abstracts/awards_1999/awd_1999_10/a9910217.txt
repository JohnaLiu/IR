Abstract    :
              The Santa Fe Institute (SFI) will establish a two-year Physics Graduate Student
              Fellowship pilot program to provide physics graduate students with a
              multidisciplinary research and educational experience to supplement their
              graduate physics training.  Part of the process will be introducing them to the
              applications of approaches and concepts from physics to topics outside of the
              traditional domain of physics.  Part of the process will involve a research
              collaboration consisting of the student, his/her university advisor, and an SFI
              faculty or staff scientist.  In addition, short courses in fields outside of
              physics will be taught by resident SFI faculty and staff.  Participating
              students will be in residence at the SFI for a period of up to 6 months.
