Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the preparation and study of new bridged
              metallocenes containing at least two active sites that differ in their
              copolymerization characteristics in order to produce alternating or blocky
              copolymers.  The goals of the work are to develop a new family of
              ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymers of defined sequence distribution and to use
              the studies as a testing ground to evaluate the precise structural features of
              metallocene catalysts that control copolymerization characteristics.

With
              this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research of Dr. Robert M. Waymouth of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford
              University.  Professor Waymouth will focus his work on developing a new kinetic
              strategy for the synthesis of olefin copolymers of controlled sequence
              distribution.  With the potential for the controlled preparation of new
              materials, the research has important ramifications for the polymer industry.
