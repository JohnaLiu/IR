Abstract    :
              This award provides  support for the development and testing of fully
              interactive earth-system models that allow for feedbacks among the  atmosphere,
               hydrosphere,  and biosphere. Paleoclimate studies have shown how feedbacks
              among earth system components play a key role in the large climate changes
              since the last glacial maximum (LGM) 21,000 years ago (21 ka). Newly
              established global paleoclimatic data sets and improved earth system models
              will allow TEMPO investigators to explore the impact of these feedbacks on the
              simulation of 21 and 6 ka climates and also on inducing abrupt changes in
              late-glacial and Holocene climates. The proponents plan to use a fast
              synchronously coupled atmosphere-ocean model with and without IBIS, a biosphere
              model, synchronously coupled to it and make both long (500-1000 yr) and short
              (50-~00 yr) integrations to test the impacts of ocean, biospheric, and
              hydrological feedbacks on the climate simulations. The research will focus on
              1) simulations of the mean climates for 21 and 6 ka with global  data/model 
              comparisons,  model/model  comparisons, and estimation of the
              decade-to-century-scale variability at these dates; 2) exploratory simulations
              of some possible causes of abrupt changes since 21 ka with thorough analysis
              and comparison with temporal sequences of vegetational and hydrological data;
              and 3) mean and transient simulations for 2x or 3xCO2 and comparisons with the
              mechanisms that produced the mean state, variability and abrupt changes during
              the last 21 ka. This latter research will link our studies of past climates
              directly to the study of possible future climates.
