This award supports Demetri Psaltis and three students from
              the California Institute of Technology in a collaboration with Karsten Buse of
              the Department of Physics at the University of Osnabrueck, Germany.  The
              project will focus on the study of volume holographic recording in
              photorefractive crystals.  The major problem up to now has been that the
              holographic data gets erased during read out, making it unsuitable for storage
              devices.  A solution to the problem lies in the use of doubly-doped crystals,
              and this collaboration will optimize the materials which could be used to make
              rewritable storage devices.  Together the two groups will model the physical
              mechanisms responsible for the success of the method, improve the performance
              of the method by testing other dopants and crystals, and demonstrate a
              persistent holographic memory system incorporating doubly-doped crystals.
