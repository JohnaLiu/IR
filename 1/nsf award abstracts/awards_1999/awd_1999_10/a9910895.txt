This conference will focus on quantum chromodynamics (QCD) as the
              fundamental theory of strong interactions, with special emphasis on the physics
              of the two mainstream facilities of the nuclear physics community: the
              Continuous Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson Laboratory, and the
              Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  A
              broad range of topics within this theme will be covered in a total of nine
              sessions.  The talks will provide an opportunity for junior investigators to
              become acquainted with the field.
