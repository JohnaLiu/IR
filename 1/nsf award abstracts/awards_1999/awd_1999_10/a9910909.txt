This research builds upon a substantial research
              literature in cognitive psychology on the suggestive effects of "post-event
              information." It is hypothesized that eyewitness memory in a police line-up,
              will be affected by such information, leading to certain false positive
              identifications.  The project here is to investigate the conditions under which
              viewing an intervening lineup is likely to reduce the accuracy of eyewitness
              memory on a subsequent lineup.  There are four experiments using four
              forensically relevant factors known to relate to memory trace strength:
              own-race versus cross-race faces, initial exposure time to the target face,
              retention interval, and age of suspects.  The long-term goal of this research
              is to contribute to the development of theories of memory and explore the
              dimensions of  suggestibility in the every-day setting of police work and
              courts of law.
