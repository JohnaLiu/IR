Abstract    :
              9910147
An exciting new possibility has arisen to investigate the enhancement
              of lifetimes of ferrous metals resulting from magnetic field treatment. The
              method seems feasible but is as yet scientifically unproven. The objective of
              this research is to evaluate the technology and to identify the nature of any
              beneficial effects on the performance of manufactured parts made from ferrous
              metals. We will also examine how this method works, optimize the conditions for
              its use and finally if it shows promise, determine how it may best be
              used.***
