This action is to support the participation of US researchers
              in the International Conference on Rock Engineering Techniques for Site
              Characterization (ROCKSITE), being held in Bangalore, India, 6-8 December 1999;
              as well as participation in the Indo-US-Norwegian Workshop on Field Methods in
              Geomechanics, Bangalore, India, 9-10 December 1999.

The ROCKSITE conference
              is organized jointly by the National Institute of Rock Mechanics (NIRM) in
              India, and the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) in Norway.  The focus is
              on geotechnical investigation methods and tools for the design of excavations
              in civil and mining applications.  At the conclusion of the three-day ROCKSITE
              conference, participants from India, Norway and the United States will
              participate in the two-day workshop to discuss the various methods currently
              being used for site characterization, and participate in a field trip to the
              large underground powerhouse cavern, Pykara, being constructed in Southern
              India.

The overall theme for both meetings and the field trip is the methods
              for field-use characterization in rock masses, both those currently in use, as
              well as potentially new innovative methods.  The discussion is planned around
              three topics in field site characterization: (1) application to optimizing
              blast fragmentation, (2) application to surface and underground stability
              design, and (3) application to fluid flow through rock masses.  Finally, the
              field trip to the Pykara Powerhouse Project will address field characterization
              issues involved with this site.

It is expected that these meetings will
              develop a better understanding of rock mass characterization methods.  A World
              Wide Web site will be established to document the workshop findings and to
              encourage additional and continued discussion of rock mass characterization
              methods by the rock mechanics R&D community.
