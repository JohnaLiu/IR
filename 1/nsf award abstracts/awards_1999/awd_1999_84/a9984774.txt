ABSTRACT
    Systematic attacks
              to military, government and corporate networks underscore
the fundamental
              importance of computer security.  Unfortunately, current
approaches to
              security often yield ad hoc patchworks of inconsistent policies
and
              incompatible mechanisms.  The problem is two-fold: Techniques and tools
              are
limited, and educational programs are sparse.
    The research activities
              embed configurable security services within
programming languages for
              developing distributed applications.  Denotational
semantics for these
              languages map high-level access control structures into a
ticket-based model
              that captures heterogeneous security policies and supports
the formal
              verification of secure behavior.  Specialized algorithms implement
security
              proofs for applications at compile-time and runtime.
    A secure information
              enclave, a proof-of-concept application, is built
around a glue language with
              programmable security policy coordination services.
Mediators gather metadata
              from remote sites, engaging cooperative policy
management methods to negotiate
              secure interoperability.  Static and dynamic
analyses guarantee global policy
              consistency for the enclave.
    The educational activities have three major
              thrusts: The development of a
Center of Excellence for Information Assurance
              Education, the expansion of the
Tulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge --a
              nationally recognized program of
academics, research and service designed for
              computer science majors, and the
systematic incorporation of minorities,
              especially Native Americans (the PI is a
native Cherokee), in computer science
              and engineering programs in the state of
Oklahoma.
