Abstract    :
              Information systems for supporting the fluid organizations of the 21st century
              must be correspondingly open and agile, able to automatically configure
              themselves out of heterogeneous system components, accommodate the dynamic exit
              and entry of hitherto unknown participants and maintain system stability in the
              face of limited trust. The goal of this project is to develop technologies that
              enable the construction of such Contractual Agent Societies (CAS), open
              information systems where independently developed agents configure themselves
              automatically through a set of dynamically negotiated social contracts.  Social
              contracts define the shared context of agent interactions, including
              ontologies, joint beliefs, joint goals, normative behaviors, etc. In addition,
              they specify classes of contract violations together with associated sanctions
              and enforcement mechanisms. The deliverables of this work include a language
              and ontology for representing social contracts, as well as the definition of
              agent architectures capable of negotiating social contracts and adapting their
              behavior accordingly. Significant attention will be given to the experimental
              evaluation of the proposed agent architecture by developing prototype CAS
              versions of at least two different electronic marketplaces and demonstrating
              how CAS buyer and seller agents can successfully move between marketplaces,
              adapting themselves according to the rules of each marketplace.
