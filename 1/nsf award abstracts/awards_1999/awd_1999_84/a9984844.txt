Abstract    :
              Professor Sean Decatur of Mount Holyoke College is funded through a CAREER grant
              in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program.  He will study the fundamental
              infrared spectroscopic properties of peptides by the use of isotopically
              substituted  synthetic peptides.  Measurements include infrared absorption and
              vibrational circular dichroism spectroscopy.  The thermodynamics and kinetics
              of the helix-coil transition of peptides will be studied at a level previously
              not possible using the isotopically substituted compounds.  Some synthetic
              strategies for the peptides are also the aim of this research.  The work will
              be of use in protein folding problems.  Professor Decatur's teaching efforts
              are focused on mentoring undergraduates in research, designing a new advanced
              chemistry laboratory course and conducting a new course on biotechnology and
              ethics.  

Understanding the structures of proteins and how they fold into
              their native forms is a key goal in biophysics at present.  One experimental
              approach is to study peptides and their folding in real time using infrared
              light as a measurement technique.  However, the interaction of infrared light
              and peptides is not fully understood, and this work will fill in important gaps
              in the interpretation of a large amount of infrared data already in the
              literature.  The work will allow scientists to better ascertain protein
              structures, and to develop peptide and protein therapeutics.  Professor
              Decatur's education plan will serve both chemistry majors and nonmajors, and
              will have impact on promoting women in scientific fields.
