Abstract    :
              This is the first year of funding of a 4 year continuing award. This project
              will investigate new approaches to the classification, analysis, and
              resynthesis of sound. The research plan is composed of three elements: The
              majority of the effort will focus on the development of algorithms and
              techniques for sound parameterization and synthesis. The PI will explore ways
              to sort and match sounds with algorithms, voice algorithm parameters, and test
              human subjects to determine success of synthesis. He will develop
              classification and analysis software to automate existing algorithms,
              eliminating the human guidance andjudgment currently required. He will develop
              new algorithms for classes of sounds that do not yield to existing parametric
              synthesis algorithms. He will also work on novel interfaces for controlling
              sound, and create systems that can take advantage of flexible sound synthesis
              and control. By the end of the project, machine algorithms will have been
              developed that can take certain (large) classes of sounds as input, select the
              appropriate synthesis algorithm, extract parameters for resynthesis, and
              predict human responses as to the quality of the synthesized sound; simple
              systems will have been constructed which demonstrate the utility of the
              synthesis algorithms. This research will yield new tools at both the input and
              output ends of the interactive sound chain to benefit diverse applications such
              as portable computers, virtual reality, augmented reality, awareness systems,
              teleconferencing and remote collaboration applications.
