Our understanding of life at the cellular and molecular level is
              leading to the rapid development of new technologies for treating disease and
              replacing lost organ function.  The future success or failure of these
              technologies hinges on gaining a new understanding of cells and their
              molecules, developing the abilities of scientists and engineers to synthesize
              knowledge gained through diverse perspectives and approaches, and advancing the
              general public's understanding of cell biology and biotechnology.  This project
              addresses these issues in an integrated way that incorporates new approaches to
              research and education.  The research component of this project will focus on
              the molecular mechanisms of microtubule severing, important for cell division,
              axonal outgrowth, and flagellar resorption.  Using state-of-the-art
              videomicroscopy techniques, the dynamics of individual microtubules and
              individual severing enzymes will be tracked for the first time.  The behavior
              will be compared quantitatively to computer simulation models of the
              fundamental biophysical mechanisms underlying microtubule severing.  In
              addition, optical forces will be used to mechanically deform microtubules to
              determine the effect of deformation on severing.  The educational component of
              this project will focus on providing hands-on and interactive learning
              experiences in cellular and molecular bioengineering.  An integrated
              research/educational "Future Faculty" program for advanced engineering
              undergraduates from underrepresented groups will be developed.  The development
              of an interactive. hands-on "Laser Guidance of Bacteria" experiment for the
              Science Museum of Minnesota will bring the results of this research project to
              the public.  The development of videoconferencing as a means to promote direct
              interaction between faculty, students, and guest experts without regard to
              geographical location will improve distance education.
