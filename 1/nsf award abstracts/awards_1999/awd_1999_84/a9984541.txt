Abstract
This
              research seeks improved methods for assessing the evolution of urban transport
              and land use systems; such methods are a critical component of
              transport-infrastructure planning and urban systems engineering. By emphasizing
              long-term development decisions that are the foundation for travel demand, this
              project will attempt to identify optimal investments in transport
              infrastructure and effective, coordinated transport and land use strategies to
              meet the needs of a region.  This objective will be pursued by advancing the
              principles of integrated transport system analysis in two ways: (1) development
              of a systems-explicit model of travel demand and location choice founded on
              behaviorally rigorous, simultaneously estimated equations; and (2)
              communication of the tools used and results achieved to students,
              practitioners, and colleagues across the United States and around the world.

              The proposed approach combines surplus maximization theory with behaviorally
              flexible sub-models, and relies on regression models and system simulation. 
              Through improvements in the characterization of processes which underlie the
              dynamics of transport and related urban markets, the model is intended to
              reliably predict optimal sites and sizes of transport infrastructure; assess
              the energy-consumption, noxious-emissions, and location-choice impacts of
              different traffic-management policies; and draw general conclusions about the
              long-run development and travel-demand effects of various transport design
              strategies. Identification of advantageous network investments and effective,
              coordinated transport and land use strategies to meet the needs of regions are
              the work's ultimate objective.
