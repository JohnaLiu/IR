              Number:  9984616 Proposal Title:  Intelligent Self-Monitoring Nondestructive
              Evaluation System for Quantitative Global Assessment of Bridges Abstract:
The
              research goal of this proposal is concerned with the development of a
              self-monitoring modal based nondestructive evaluation (NDE) system.  The
              research is focused on the following four areas: (1) extraction of the modal
              parameters, (2) detection and localization of damage, (3) estimation of damage
              magnitude, and (4) assessment of the damage (i.e. determining the reliability
              of the structure).  The objectives within these four focus area are:  to
              determine the optimum method to extract the modal parameters form ambient test
              data and define the data acquisition system; to determine the optimum method or
              combination of methods for the purpose of damage detection and localization; to
              determine the most appropriate method to estimate the magnitude (severity) of
              the damage; and to determine the most appropriate method to perform global
              assessment of the structure.  Although may vibration based nondestructive
              damage detection methods exist, a critical area that is missing in current
              research is the estimation of the magnitude of the damage, the assessment of
              the damage on the structure as a whole, and the integration of this information
              into existing bridge management systems.  For this reason, this research is
              focused on the estimation and assessment of damage and the integration of this
              information into current bridge management systems.
The educational goal of
              this proposal is concerned with the incorporation of research and four
              educational tools (hands-on learning, critical thinking, communicating in
              engineering , and technology in the classroom) into engineering courses.  This
              incorporation of education tools is expected to facilitate the development of a
              sound mechanical engineering research and educational program in modal
              analysis
