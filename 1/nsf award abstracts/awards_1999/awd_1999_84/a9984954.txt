Abstract    :
              Sensor development is an extremely costly and time-consuming process at the
              present time.  Integrated sensors based on unique performance specifications
              and low volume needs are unavailable for robotics use despite the advancement
              in sensor technologies.  The full potential of integrated sensors in robotics
              applications is not realized.  The PI proposes to introduce an artificial hair
              cell, which is inspired by biological hair cell receptors, as a modular
              building block for a variety of sensors.  The broad
objective is to establish
              a radical sensor architecture and a new approach for the efficient development
              of integrated sensors for robotics applications.  Specific objectives of this
              research project are: (1) to establish the design principles, fabrication
              processes, and material expertise for individual hair cell sensors and to
              assess and optimize their mechanical characteristics; (2) to implement
              artificial hair cells in two
exemplary sensor systems - a gyroscopic and an
              artificial lateral-line
sensor for underwater robots. 

Excellence in
              education will be vigorously pursued in the PI's career. During the period of
              this award, the PI plans to undertake fourinitiatives including (1) a new
              undergraduate/graduate curriculum in the
area of micro electromechanical
              systems (MEMS); (2) a new MEMS class as an integral component of a joint Master
              of Engineering degree program to educate professionals; (3) an education
              outreach program that encourages high-school students to explore; (4) outreach
              activities.  It is anticipated that these developments will significantly
              enrich and strengthen the educational programs in the University of Illinois
              and the community.
