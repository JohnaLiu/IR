Abstract    :
              This proposal outlines a development plan focused on the following educational
              and research goals: (1) implement a research program in silicon nanostructures;
              (2) improve materials-related education in the chemical engineering curriculum;
              and (3) broaden and strengthen materials science & engineering education at
              UT-Austin.

The research program outlined in the proposal aims to develop wet
              chemical synthetic methods for silicon nanocrystals and nanowires.  The
              specific research objectives are: Develop a new wet chemical strategy to yield
              size-monodisperse, crystalline silicon nanocrystals, or quantum dots, using
              supercritical capping solvents; Extend the supercritical solvent nanocrystal
              synthetic method to silicon nanowires using dodecanethiol-capped gold
              nanocrystals as growth templates; Characterize the size-dependent electronic
              and optical properties of the silicon nanocrystals and nanowires in order to
              gain an understanding of the quantum confinement effects in silicon.

The
              educational objectives are: A materials science minor, or emphasis, will be
              developed for chemical engineers obtaining Bachelor's of Science degrees; An
              electronic materials elective course in chemical engineering will be developed
              that stresses the electronic properties of materials; A materials laboratory
              for chemical engineering undergraduates will be developed in conjuction with
              the course in (2); The PI will be directly involved in the reorganization of
              the MS&E Ph.D. qualifying exam, with an emphasis on breadth and identifying the
              MS&E core.
