Abstract    :
              Eric Bittner of the University of Houston is funded by a CAREER grant from the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program.  Bitter will develop mixed
              quantum/classical dynamics techniques for simulating charge carrier and
              excitation dynamics in conjugated polymer systems.  A new quantum trajectory
              approach based on a hydrodynamic description of quantum mechanics will be
              developed.  This method treats the wave function as a fluid of Lagrangian
              particles that move under classical equations of motion that includes a
              non-local quantum potential that arises from the kinetic energy operator.  He
              will examine the formation of self-trapped excitons, charge pair recombination
              dynamics, radiative hopping, and singlet-triplet coupling dynamics as they
              pertain to available ultra-fast experimental data.  Bittner's teaching plan
              involves the development of a chemical simulations laboratory course for third
              and fourth year undergraduates to introduce them to state of the art chemical
              visualization and modeling tools.

The area of quantum simulations of
              time-dependent processes encompasses electron and proton transfer rates in
              solution, nonadiabatic processes, and exciton transfer dynamics.  These
              processes are characterized by both theory and experiment on femtosecond to
              picosecond time scales.  These phenomena are of importance in understanding
              photo-excited polymer chains and thin films.   The undergraduate laboratory
              course will acquaint students with computational chemical simulation tools that
              will help them explore chemical problems.
