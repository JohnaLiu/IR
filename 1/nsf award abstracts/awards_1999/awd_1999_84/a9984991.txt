Abstract    :
              This is the first year of fimding of a 4-year continuing award. The P1 will
              investigate the perceptual
dimensionality associated with an interface, with
              the goal of exploring the possibility that a new approach
based on
              psychophysical experimentation will allow herto overcome the crucial limitation
              of the traditional
method of multidimensional scaling (MDS) that it cannot
              deal with the situation where the dimensionality of
the perceptual space
              exceeds that of the physical space. The information transmission capabilities
              of several
human-machine interfaces will also be assessed, with the goal of
              developing an efficient paradigm for
obtaining reliable estimates of
              information transfer. Work on these two issues will be performed in the context
              of a commercially available force-feedback display, a new haptic directional
              display, and a novel sensing chair. By working on these interfaces with very
              different sensor and actuator technologies, the P1 hopes to develop a general
              information-based framework with applications to other areas of 
HC1. The new
              information-based framework will be integrated in several ways into the
              graduate and 
undergraduate curriculum and research projects, including
              hands-on research opportunities for undergraduate students wherein they
              practice their leadership skills through technical excellence and mentoring of
              K-12 school children; these activities will be conducted in part in
              collaboration with NASA through involvement in its Reduced-Gravity Student
              Flight Opportunities Program (colloquially known as the "vomit-comet").
