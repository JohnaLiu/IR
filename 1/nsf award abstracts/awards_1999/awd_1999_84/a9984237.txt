              Abstract:
---------
The demand for voice and data transmission over wireless
              channels is
increasing at a tremendous pace. Unfortunately, the
              characteristics of
the wireless channel (e.g., fading and interference) impose
              obstacles
for satisfying this demand. The single most effective technique
              to
accomplish reliable communication over a fading channel is
              ``diversity''
which attempts to provide the receiver with independently faded
              copies
of the transmitted signal. Channel coding may also be used to
              provide
(a form of time) diversity for immunization against the
              impairments
of the wireless channel. In addition, various diversity techniques
              may
be combined to further improve the system performance in a
              wireless
environment. Space-time coding which combines channel coding with
              space
diversity is a recent example of combining different diversity
              techniques
and has proven to be effective in providing high data rates over
              fading
channels. 

This research involves development of new channel coding
              techniques
for the wireless link. In particular, coded modulation techniques
              for
multiple transmit and multiple receive antenna systems over block
fading
              channels are developed. A significant part of the research
              includes
development of turbo (based) coded modulation techniques as an
              alternative
to the current space-time codes. In addition, the investigators
              study the
use of multilevel codes and bit interleaved coded modulation schemes
              for
systems with antenna diversity. They conduct a theoretical
              performance
analysis of various coded modulation systems, develop code
              design
principles, and devise simpler and efficient decoding algorithms.
              In
addition, they consider practical issues including the evaluation of
              code
performance in the presence of interference.
