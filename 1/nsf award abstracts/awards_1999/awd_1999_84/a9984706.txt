Abstract    :
              This award supports the study of computational principles and neural mechanisms
              underlying active perception -- the active gathering of information to
              construct, update and improve a system's representation,knowledge and
              understanding of its environment. The PI will develop an integrated
              multidisciplinary research and educational program that utilizes techniques
              from computer and information science, system engineering, neuroscience and
              psychology to study how monkeys and humans use eye movement to actively analyze
              visual scenes in different visual tasks and how the neural machinery and
              representations are transformed in these processes. To prove the theoretical
              framework he is developing, he will build an adaptive active vision system that
              will learn to see. Along with the research, he will enhance the traditional
              computer science and computer vision curriculum at Carnegie Mellon by
              introducing problems,theories and practice from neuroscience and neural
              computation to computer science classrooms and laboratories to prepare a new
              generation of interdiscciplinary computer scientists for the new challenges in
              computational biology.
