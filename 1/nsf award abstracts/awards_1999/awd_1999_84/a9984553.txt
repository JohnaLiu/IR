Abstract    :
              With the continued scaling of VLSI technologies, interconnects play a dominant
              role in determining system performance, power, reliability, and cost. To ensure
              timing closure of designs, impacts of interconnects must be considered at every
              design stage. This research is directed at developing an interconnect-centric
              design methodology that emphasizes interconnect planning and synthesis during
              physical design flow. Research activities being carried out under this grant
              include: (a) Developing routability-driven repeater planning algorithms for the
              optimization of multiple global nets during floorplanning and placement; (b)
              Developing novel layout synthesis techniques -- topology construction,
              wire-sizing/splitting and spacing, and repeater insertion -- for the
              optimization of interconnect delay and signal integrity of on-chip RLC
              interconnects; (c) Developing global routing algorithms that perform
              simultaneously the routing of multiple nets and the synthesis of dedicated
              current return paths; (d) Developing reliable clock synthesis techniques that
              minimize the risk of current induced noise associated with the switching
              activities of circuits.
