Abstract    :
              The research objectives of this CAREER project are (1) to complete a survey of
              amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals (and their co-evolved parasites) at 15
              sites in the Tsaratanana Massif Complex of Madagascar; (2) to describe new
              species, revise taxonomic groups, and produce species lists, monographs, keys,
              and field guides; and (3) to establish website accessible database that can be
              used for future research work and conservation planning.  Survey results are
              expected to include new biogeographic and systematic data for an estimated 350
              species of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals, including the discovery
              about 50 - 150 undescribed species of vertebrates.  The teaching objectives of
              the CAREER proposal will be the introduction of a new course, linking via
              satellite phone, ongoing survey activities in Madagascar to students, and
              involving undergraduate and graduate students in field-work, curation, and data
              analysis.  This project will be jointly funded by the Biotic Surveys and
              Inventories program and the Africa program in the Division of International
              Programs.
