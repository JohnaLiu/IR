Abstract    :
              Keil/9984163
This proposal requests funding to investigate how substrate
              availability dictates heterotrophic bacteria use of protein with the aid of
              stable isotopes of carbon.  Using both laboratory manipulations and field
              sampling, sources of enrichments in glycine and non-protein amino acids in
              sediments and water will be investigated.  Ultimately the role of microbial
              reworking in preserving organic matter will be determined.  In the educational
              portion of this proposal, the PI requests funding to develop and implement  a
              research apprenticeship program for high school and undergraduate students to
              conduct interdisciplinary research.
