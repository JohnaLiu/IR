Abstract    :
              The proposed research will focus on three partly related
directions in
              multiresolution methods: (I) subdivision schemes
and wavelets in the geometric
              setting, (II) the advantage of redundant
systems and  (III) ideal data
              representation in higher dimensions.

Subdivision and multiresolution methods
              in the geometric setting
is a recently launched research area.
Prompted by
              the extremely high interests in applications such as terrain
modeling and 3-D
              scanning technology, this research direction has attracted
the attention of
              both computer scientists and applied mathematicians.
Existing subdivision
              schemes for surface generation do not promise
well-defined curvature
              everywhere in a resulted surface. In various
applications it is desirable to
              work with curvature smooth surfaces.
In the regular setting the proposer
              recently constructed a family of
C^2 subdivision schemes with a small
              interpolating stencil.
Underlying this construction is a variety of tools from
              optimization,
wavelet theory and multivairate interpolation theory. This
              project will
further refine these tools in order to resolve the original open
              problem
and such that these tools can be applied to other settings as
              well.

For various applications in image reconstruction/processing, it
was
              found that highly redundant wavelet-like image representations
significantly
              outperform the standard non-redundant orthogonal
wavelet transforms used
              ubiquitously in the image coding
community. On the one hand, there is
              currently no complete theory
for explaining the fundamental advantages of
              redundancy. On the
other hand, researchers have just started to realize
              the
fundamental limits of wavelet transforms in higher dimensions and
have
              proposed a wide variety of novel data representation schemes
that address
              these fundamental limits. Research activity
under this project seeks to
              develop mathematical theory and
computational tools in the general area of
              adaptive methods of
representing and analyzing images and other
              multidimensional data.

The educational plan proposes a new way of
              teaching
computational science. The project
will develop teaching materials
              for our numerical computing courses
that better suit the needs, interests and
              mathematical ability
of computer science students. The goal of
this project
              is to develop a set of
electronic lecture notes for our future senior
              numerical computing
course. These lecture notes will add two new dimensions to
              any of
the existing textbooks: (i) An interactive computational
environment
              (based on QPE's such as Matlab or Octave)
will be integrated into the notes so
              that a student can easily reproduce
any computational result presented and
              derive any new
computational experiments. (ii) Applications
areas such as
              computer graphics, computer vision, data-mining and
computational fluid
              dynamics will be
used in various places of
this notes to illustrate the role
              of numerical methods in industry.
