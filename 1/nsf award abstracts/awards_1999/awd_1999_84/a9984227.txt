Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of synthetic methods for the
              preparation of amanitin and phalloidin.  The synthetic strategy involves late
              introduction of problematic functionality and early introduction of the
              thioether bridges common to the two targets.  The majority of the peptide
              backbone will be assembled using solid phase peptide synthesis.  Analog studies
              will be used to allow understanding of the specific binding properties of
              amanitin to RNA polymerase II and phalloidin to polymerized actin.  The
              educational focus of the project will be the development of a new graduate
              training program in Chemical Biology.

With this CAREER award, the Organic
              and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
              activities of Dr. Rodney K. Guy of the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry
              at the University of California-San Francisco.  Dr. Guy will focus his research
              on the total synthesis and study of the molecular modes of action of two
              related natural products:amanitin and phalloidin.  The natural products and
              synthetic analogs will be studied to understand the molecular determinants that
              drive the selectivity of binding for these compounds.  The educational portion
              of the project involves curriculum development at the graduate level.
