Abstract    :
              This research focuses on understanding, modeling, and supporting human decision
              making in complex
situations such as manufacturing, aviation, process control,
              military and non-military command and
control and transportation. These
              situations are challenging, and can lead to potential problems and
human
              errors, because they are often rapidly changing, have uncertain and risky
              elements, and require
quick responses. To study these,issues, the project
              includes the development of interactive computer
simulations to allow
              experiments in which participants will make decisions in complex
              environments
such as process control or transportation. Planned experiments
              include investigating how people cope
with uncertain information when making
              decisions, identifying appropriate types of performance
information which may
              help people learn to make better decisions, and developing display formats
              and
visualizations to help people better understand uncertainty and how it may
              affect their decisions.
Research results will be relevant for the development
              of computer displays, decision-aids, and
training recommendations which can
              lead to improved decision-making performance. The project includes
educational
              components which are integrated with the research plan through the utilization
              of the
experimental simulations in course exercises and projects, through
              undergraduate and graduate student
involvement in the ongoing research, and
              through the incorporation of research results into course
materials.
