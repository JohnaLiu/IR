The goal of this project is to study substrate
              recognition by the Neurospora VS ribozyme using state-of-the-art nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) methods in order to gain a better understanding of the
              structural basis of RNA recognition. Substrate recognition by the Neurospora
              ribozyme depends on an essential loop-loop tertiary interaction between
              stem-loop I from the substrate domain and stem-loop V from the catalytic
              domain.   The work will focus on determining the high-resolution NMR structures
              of fragments of stem-loops I and V, the effects of divalent metal ions binding
              on their conformation, and on determining the NMR structure of a stable complex
              formed by these two stem-loops.  

This research will improve our fundamental
              understanding of RNA structure and dynamics and of the role of metal ions in
              RNA structure and catalysis.  Undergraduate and graduate training programs in
              nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and nucleic acid structure and function
              will be developed.  Through teleconferencing technologies and web-based
              instructional material, the teaching activities will serve the instructional
              needs of the scientific community.
