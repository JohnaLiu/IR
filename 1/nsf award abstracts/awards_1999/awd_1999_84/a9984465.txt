Abstract    :
              This project will strengthen the high performance computing academic program at
              Mississippi State University by creating a symbiosis between research and
              education. The research component will ultimately help extend the knowledge of
              the scientific community towards obtaining accurate theoretical models, so that
              computer simulations of physical phenomena give correct predictions. The
              research will do this by studying dynamic scheduling strategies for these
              computations, which (when properly constructed) provide simple, fast, and
              effective algorithms for the simulations. The education component will nurture
              the development of students' fundamental skills in problem solving in both
              theoretical and practical training. It will do this by improving the curricula
              by coupling strong foundational courses from different disciplines and
              providing meaningful interactions between them.

Technically, the research
              will extend the study of dynamic scheduling strategies used in scientific
              computing with new methods, and evaluate those methods on both analytical and
              experimental bases. The work here specifically addresses the issues of
              discovering novel dynamic scheduling strategies that can accommodate highly
              unpredictable program behavior, providing an integrated dynamic scheduling
              framework for scientific applications, and analyzing the performance of
              parallel applications via predictive performance metrics. Doing this will use
              the expertise and infrastructure of the NSF Engineering Research Center for
              Computational Field Simulation.
