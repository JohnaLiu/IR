Abstract    :
              Future systems built on a billion-transistor chip will be immensely complex.
              These Systems-on-a-Chip (SoC) will be built with multiple heterogeneous
              processor cores, and an operating system is needed to control the interactions
              between and computations occurring in both hardware and software. This project
              is developing a Systems-on-a-Chip Operating System (SoCOS) implementation with
              timing guarantees able to satisfy hard real-time application demands. The
              following topics are being explored: (1) a SoCOS compiler where part of the
              SoCOS is implemented in hardware in order to both speed up critical bottlenecks
              and more effectively manage concurrency among hardware and software; and (2)
              design and synthesis of a Dynamic Memory Management Unit (DMMU) in hardware for
              multiple processors and hardware, where the SoC has two main levels of memory
              hierarchy: each processor's local cache, and larger on-chip memory. The DMMU
              handles allocation of the larger on-chip memory; software on each processor
              handles its local cache. A quantification of the trade-offs among
              implementation and synthesis strategies for SoC Operating Systems is being
              investigated.
