Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop fundamental techniques to allow
              efficient and interactive knowledge discovery from large multidimensional
              datasets with spatial and temporal attributes. There are two general research
              goals. The first involves the investigation of effective density approximation
              techniques to approximate very large geospatial datasets. The proposed
              techniques are used both to facilitate simple exploratory data mining tasks on
              large geospatial datasets, and to efficiently provide accurate approximate
              solutions to general data mining tasks, such as clustering, classification and
              outlier detection. The second involves designing and implementing new
              algorithms and techniques for similarity queries in geospatial datasets. The
              educational component of the project aims to develop courses that emphasize the
              fundamental ideas in data mining, and introduce students to real data mining
              problems. The results of this project will have a significant impact on how
              large multidimensional datasets are analyzed, with applications in the fields
              of Geographic Information Systems, Epidemiology, and Environmental research.
