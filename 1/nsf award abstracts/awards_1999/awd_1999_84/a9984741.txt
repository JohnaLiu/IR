Abstract    :
              The rapidly expanding size and complexity of digital library collections
              necessitates new interfaces for exploring, searching, and understanding their
              contents.  This project will investigate how to effectively incorporate large
              category hierarchies into information access user interfaces and will address
              the following research questions: Can dynamically suggested query previews
              improve comprehension and findability within digital libraries and
              domain-specific text collections?  Can categorical metadata be used effectively
              within such query previews?  Does visualization of category metadata improve
              comprehension of the relationships among articles for some users?  A series of
              designs will be prototyped and evaluated, starting with text-based displays and
              progressing to sophisticated visualizations.  The evaluation will be of a
              ``regression test'' form, in which the same set of evaluation criteria are
              applied at each stage of the design.  The educational component of this
              proposal will integrate the results of this and related research into a
              graduate curriculum on information organization, retrieval, and use. 
              Specifically, it will answer open questions about the relationship between
              information organization techniques and information retrieval interfaces that
              can make use of such organizations.
