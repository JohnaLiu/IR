Abstract    :
              Jeffery Saven of the University of Pennsylvania is supported by a CAREER grant
              from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to develop new
              techniques to provide a quantitative understanding of protein folding. Three
              specific areas are targeted: 1) to generalize "foldability criteria" for
              identifying sequences that fold to a given structure; 2) to develop statistical
              methods that use these criteria to identify properties of sequences likely to
              fold to a target 3D structure; and 3) to study synthetic folding of
              non-biological polymers.  Saven's teaching plan consists of integrating
              chemical applications of statistical concepts in undergraduate and graduate
              level courses.  He will develop a number of modules that provide the student
              with visual interactive experiences.  

One of the next great advances in
              molecular science will be a quantitative understanding of molecular folding,
              the process by which proteins spontaneously acquire well-defined conformations.
               Researchers have learned much about folding by examining the large diversity
              of proteins present in nature.  Combinatorial chemistry and molecular biology
              methods make it possible to create a huge diversity of sequences in the
              laboratory.  Saven will develop theoretical methods that can address the huge
              numbers of possible sequences.  The studies to be undertaken in this project
              will aid researchers in designing desired folded structures.  Ultimately, this
              work will lead to a greater understanding of how structure is related to
              sequence for proteins and for other folding polymers.
