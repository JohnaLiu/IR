              Verifiable Specifications: Tools for Reliable Reactive
System
              Development

Developing reliable software for reactive systems is
              a
challenging task. This project will focus on combining
and extending the
              results from two areas which address
this problem: 1) specification languages
              and 2) automated
verification methods for reactive systems. Building on
              the
recent results in these areas the goal of this project
is to develop
              verifiable specification languages. This
will involve research from two
              directions: 1) From the
verification side the goal is to extend the scope
              of
techniques such as model checking to make them applicable
to a wider set
              of systems. 2) From the specification side
the goal is to restrict the
              specification languages as much
as possible (without reducing their ability to
              specify
complex systems) in order to make their automated
              verification
feasible. This project will address both theoretical issues
such
              as complexity and efficiency of model checking
techniques, and practical
              issues such as investigating
usability of software specification languages and
              automated
verification techniques in practice. Automated verification
tools
              developed based on the results of this project will
also be used as
              educational tools in both graduate and
undergraduate courses on formal methods
              and programming
languages.
