Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to investigate the mechanism by which antibody
              production is regulated in cultured hybridoma cells.  The specific project
              objectives are to: (1) determine whether the increase in antibody production in
              response to osmotic stress is regulated by transcription, translation or
              post-translational processes, (2) evaluate activities of the stress-activated
              and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades in response to osmotic stress,
              (3) establish the role of stress response proteins and chaperones in the
              osmotic stress response, (4) determine the role of cell cycle in osmotic stress
              response, and (5) use existing mathematical models of antibody synthesis to
              determine rate limiting steps in antibody synthesis.
