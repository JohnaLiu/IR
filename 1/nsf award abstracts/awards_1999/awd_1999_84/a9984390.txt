Abstract    :
              The goal of this CAREER proposal is to augment existing solid modeling
              representations to facilitate the distributed and collaborative design of
              mechanical components/assemblies with the inherent ability to parallel process
              various solid modeling tasks. Specific research objectives are (a)to synthesize
              segmentable representations that would support encoding, communication, and
              manipulation of solid models in a distributed and collaborative environment,
              (b) to enable the encoding, decoding, and streaming of solid models for
              purposes of communicating segments of solid models in a distributed and
              collaborative environment, and (c) to synthesize, in an evolutionary manner,
              complex solid models based on changing segments of solid models and propogating
              the change to the entire model. Recognizing that design involves both
              collaborative and individual learning, a collaborative and distributed design
              studio (CDDS) will be developed to provide a familiar environment for for
              students throughout their education. Three educational initiatives that will be
              undertaken as part of the CDDS include (1) three dimensional jigsaw
              macro-models of multi-material micro-devices, (2) collaborative and distributed
              design projects, and (3) webfolios (portfolios on the web). The first is
              designed to attract high-school students and underclassmen to the CDDS and
              encourage learning in an unfamiliar environment with fun-to-do projects. The
              next, targetted at upperclassmen, is designed to familiarize students with
              concepts of collaborative and distributed design. Finally, webfolios are aimed
              at all students and faculty who are interested in assessing progress (this will
              specifically be used to evaluate the research and educational impact of this
              CAREER proposal). 

                     If successful, the integrated
              research and educational objectives will benefit the numerous industries that
              use solid modeling by enabling a new generation of applications that can be
              modeled in a distributed environment enabled by parallel processing. The
              educational plan will provide industries with uniquely trained engineers in
              mechanical engineering design who will be capable of further advancing the
              state-of-art.
