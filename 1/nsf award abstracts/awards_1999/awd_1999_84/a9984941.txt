Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT:
This CAREER award provides funding to critically examine two
              classical paradigms in sediment dynamics of microtidal, partially-mixed
              estuaries.  The first is that gravitational circulation is the dominant
              mechanism for landward transport of fine sediment.  The second is that
              convergent transport of sediment within the water column is the immediate cause
              of the along-channel turbidity maximum. In the educational portion of this
              proposal, the PI requests funding to develop and implement faculty-supervised
              learning experiences for teams of graduate, undergraduate and high school
              students that integrate hands-on experiences into science instruction in ways
              consistent with national recommendations for science education reform.
