Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to identify the rate limiting steps of the
              processes of retroviral transduction and production and apply the quantitative
              understanding of these phenomena to optimize retrovirus-mediated gene transfer
              of human epidermal stem cells.  The ultimate goal is to use the technology of
              gene transfer in tissue engineering of skin equivalents to either impart new
              functions to cells or enhance existing cellular activities, in order to improve
              the therapeutic potential of skin substitutes. The project has four main
              objectives, which include: (1) to investigate the mechanisms of retroviral
              decay, (2) to investigate why increased the transduction efficiency of viruses
              is increased by reverse transcription caused by the exposure to dNTP, (3) to
              extend a previously developed mathematical model describing retroviral
              transduction to include a more detailed description of the phenomena, and (4)
              to develop a new technology to increase transduction efficiency.
