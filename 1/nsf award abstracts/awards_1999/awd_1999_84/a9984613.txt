Abstract    :
              Mark Smith of the University of Arizona is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the mechanisms and dynamics of
              gas phase reactions from 300K down to temperatures of 1 Kelvin.  These
              measurements will be performed on state selected reactants in free jet and
              supersonic Laval nozzle expansion cooled flow reactors with laser induced
              fluorescence, resonance enhanced multi-photon ionization and mass spectrometric
              probing.  Absolute reaction rate constants and product branching ratios will be
              determined for a series of ion-molecule (quenching and reaction of hydrogen
              halide ions), radical-molecule (hydrogen and carbon atom, cyanide and hydroxyl
              reactions with various hydrocarbons and other small molecules) and
              molecule-molecule (nitric oxide self quenching) reactions, many with
              astrochemical applications.  Comparisons will be made with theoretical
              calculations and higher temperature experimental measurements.  Electronic
              predissociation spectroscopy of small ions will be explored as a means of
              following the reactions in a quantum specific fashion.

These studies will
              lead to a greater understanding of how ions and molecules react at very low
              temperatures and provide fundamental information on the mechanisms of the
              reactions.  They will show how fast the reactions are, what products are
              generated and how these depend on the available energy.  These reactions are
              important in planetary atmospheres, including that of the Earth, and in
              interstellar space.
