Abstract    :
                  Aqueous-phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an important component of
              the atmospheric sulfur cycle.  The Fe-catalyzed oxidation of dissolved SO2 by
              O2 in clouds is considered one of the three major pathways for the formation of
              sulfate, however parameterization of the Fe-catalyzed oxidation pathway in
              atmospheric models currently involves considerable uncertainty.  This CAREER
              project is an investigation of the photochemical oxidation of sulfur-IV species
              in the presence of iron and organic compounds in atmospheric liquids.  The
              objectives of this study are to: 1) determine the photochemical oxidation rates
              of sulfur-IV in both authentic atmospheric waters (e.g. rain, fog, and cloud
              waters) and modeled systems containing iron-organo complexes (e.g. oxalato-,
              glyoxalato-, and pyruvato iron complexes) 2) examine the influence of other
              organic pollutants (e.g. formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formate and acetate) and
              transition metals (e.g. Cu and Mn) on the photooxidation of dissolved S02 in
              the presence of Fe-organo complexes; 3) examine the effects of dissolved SO2 on
              the photochemical cycling of Fe-organo complexes; and 4) evaluate the relative
              contribution of photochemical oxidation of sulfur-IV in the presence of
              Fe-organo complexes to the overall formation of sulfate in atmospheric liquid
              phases.  The educational component of this project involves the integration of
              atmospheric aquatic photochemistry into a teaching program by using
              demonstrations, laboratory exercises, field studies, and independent research
              projects,
