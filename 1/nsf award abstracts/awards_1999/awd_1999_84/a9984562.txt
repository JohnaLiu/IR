This research program focuses on solving the
              three-dimensional structure of the intracellular domain of a naturally
              occurring neurotrophin receptor isoform, ICD-TK- trkC, which was recently
              shown, together with P75 receptor activation, to be effective at promoting
              neuronal differentiation.  Modern multi-dimensional (1H, 15N, 13C) NMR methods
              will be used to determine its 3D structure in solution at high resolution. The
              goal of this work is to provide structural and molecular data that, together
              with site-directed mutagenesis experiments and biochemical assays, will bring
              insight as to the mechanism(s) by which TK- trkC promotes differentiation of
              neural cells.

The objective of this research is to provide fundamental
              knowledge about key biochemical interactions regulating neuronal development.
              This research will integrate the PI's major educational initiatives, including
              the recruitment of Native American students into the sciences, establishment of
              "hands on" experiences and "mini-rotations" in research laboratories for
              undergraduate students, and the organization of seminar series and mentorship
              programs to encourage under-represented student groups to pursue majors and/or
              research project in science. This project is an integral component of the PI's
              involvement with the cross-disciplinary research and educational initiatives
              being developed at Montana State University through an NSF-sponsored (IGERT)
              graduate training program.
