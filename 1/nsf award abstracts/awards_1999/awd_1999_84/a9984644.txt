Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of "Tin-Lite"alternatives to
              reactions involving organotin chemistry.  A practical, tin catalyzed Stille
              cross-coupling reaction will be developed and the methodology will also be
              applied to traditional organotin mediated reactions, copper based
              cross-couplings fluorous phase reactions and combinatorial chemistry.  The
              results could have a broad impact on the commercial synthesis of biologically
              important compounds.  The educational component of the project involves the
              introduction of high school students to a meaningful laboratory experience and
              the introduction of a pharmaceutical chemistry course at the undergraduate
              level.

With this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. Robert E..
              Maleczka of the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University. 
              Professor Maleczka will focus his research on the discovery, development and
              application of stannane mediated reactions in organic synthesis with the
              specific goal of minimizing the tin requirement in these reactions.  The
              approach will rely on the design of new reactions catalytic in tin and in
              seeking non-tin alternatives. The methodology has broad implications for
              synthesis in the pharmaceutical industry.   The educational activities of the
              project include curriculum development and high school outreach.
