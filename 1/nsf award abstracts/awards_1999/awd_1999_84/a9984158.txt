Abstract    :
              This is an exploration of a new chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for
              nanocrystalline metals and ceramic coatings based on the vapor-phase reaction
              between elemental sodium and metal chlorides or other halogenated species.  The
              relationship between vapor-phase chemistry and the resulting thin films are
              studied using ex-situ analysis of film properties and use of a CVD model,
              developed as part of this effort, incorporating chemical kinetics, vapor flow,
              transport, and nucleation.  The effects, and possible control, of salt
              supersaturations on film morphology are studied.  The relationship between
              gas-phase chemistry and film microstructure for processes involving
              simultaneous deposition of a metal and ceramic to form a
              nanocrystalline/amorphous structure is also studied; these products may have
              properties necessary for a superhard coating.

The new approach studied in
              this project offers the prospect of new industrial coatings with superior
              properties and/or a new route to known coatings that is more sound
              environmentally than current technology.
