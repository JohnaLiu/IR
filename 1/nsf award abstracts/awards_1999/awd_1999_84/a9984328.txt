Abstract    :
              This project explores employing distributed computational resources to combat
              the unreliability and highly variable performance inherent to wide-area
              systems.  The goal of this work is to balance wide-area performance, security,
              and resource utilization by efficiently replicating and migrating computation
              using inexact information distributed across multiple administrative domains. 
              To this end, this research addresses three areas important to scaling the
              global network infrastructure: i) dynamic placement and migration of
              computation for efficient utilization of global resources, ii) resource
              allocation among principals simultaneously utilizing resources in multiple
              administrative domains, and iii) a security infrastructure that enables the
              fine-grained transfer of rights for wide-area computation.  The impact of this
              work will be increase fairness, scalability, and fault tolerance for
              distributed systems leveraging this infrastructure.
