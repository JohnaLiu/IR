Abstract    :
              Lynch-Stieglitz/99-84989
This CAREER Award provides funding to reconstruct the
              patterns and magnitudes of major upper ocean currents over the past 60,000
              years using the oxygen isotope composition of foraminifera archived in ocean
              sediments.  In the educational portion of this proposal, the PI requests
              funding to develop and implement a educational summer internship program for
              high school girls. The PI plans to pair them with scientists at Lamont Doherty
              engaged in various solid earth, ocean, atmospheric, and life science research
              activities.
