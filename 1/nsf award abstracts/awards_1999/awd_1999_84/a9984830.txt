Abstract    :
              This work will develop and validate simple techniques for the performance-based
              seismic design and rehabilitation of multistory buildings. Design techniques
              will utilize a variant of the Capacity Spectrum Method known as Yield Point
              Spectra. Simple graphical techniques for determining combinations of strength
              and stiffness to achieve arbitrary performance objectives will be validated.
              Various strategies for addressing higher modes in design will be investigated
              to determine those for which response amplitudes are predicted well using a
              single mode analogy. Advanced multivariate statistical techniques will be
              applied to identify mode shapes in the results obtained from nonlinear dynamic
              analyses. Improved techniques for estimating peak interstory drifts will be
              evaluated.

A laboratory module will be developed for use by the 22
              undergraduate institutions nationwide that are acquiring benchtop shaking
              tables through the NSF CCLI program. Groups of students will design, build,
              instrument, and test small multistory frames. Data acquired will be
              post-processed to identify fundamental response characteristics. The
              performance of the system as well as the utility of the design methodology will
              be assessed.
