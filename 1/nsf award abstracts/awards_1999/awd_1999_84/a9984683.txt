Abstract    :
              Professor Christopher Bardeen of the University of Illinois  is supported by a
              CAREER award in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program.  He will study
              energy transport in conjugated polymers using ultrafast time-resolved optical
              spectroscopy.  Excited conjugated polymers undergo a transition from coherent
              exciton to incoherent Forster-type energy transfer; this transition can be
              followed using polarization and phase sensitive four-wave-mixing measurements. 
              In addition to the time behavior, Professor Bardeen will study this phenomenon
              in a spatially resolved way using near field spectroscopy in fluorescence
              resonance energy transfer mode and cathodoluminescence mode.  Nanometer sized
              crystals of the conducting polymers will also be synthesized and studied. 
              Professor Bardeen's teaching strategy consists of "active" learning on the part
              of students.  With graduate students, one emphasis is on communication and
              analytical skills which will be improved by regular, graded presentations on
              scientific research.  With undergraduate students, "Real World Chemistry"
              lectures will be given to motivate students.

The photoconducting polymer
              poly(phenylene vinylene) is currently of interest as an alternative to
              inorganic semiconductors, especially for light emitting diodes (LEDs).  This
              work will produce results needed to understand how these materials transport
              energy.   Professor Bardeen has excellent ideas about both graduate and
              undergraduate teaching which are thoughtful and adjusted to the current
              situation for the future of science and technology.
