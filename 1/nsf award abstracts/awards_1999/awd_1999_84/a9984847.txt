Abstract    :
              This is the first year of funding of a 4-year continuing award. The objective of
              this research is to lay the
groundwork for machines that are capable of
              accurate recognition and realistic synthesis of facial expressions. The
              approach is to develop and validate a dynamic spatio-temporal representation of
              facial movements, To this end, the PI will develop and evaluate methodologies
              for. robust analysis and modeling of facialmovements from video (so as to allow
              for unencumbered measurement in noninvasive interfaces). Facial activity is
              inherently dynamic in nature; therefore, automatic recognition of expressions
              from video and realistic animation of facial motion require a detailed dynamic
              representation of facial action. The PI will develop an analysissynthesis
              framework wherein model-based synthesis is used to analyze facial movement, to
              construct a spatio-temporal 3D representation of facial action that encodes the
              dynamics inherent in facialmotion. He will then evaluate the representation by
              analyzing videos of many human subjects making facial expressions, and by
              testing the synthesis of realistic facial motions. This research will provide a
              detailed scientific understanding of how people make facial expression and how
              recognition of facial expressions is possible, and thus will lay the foundation
              for systems that recognize human expressions and emotions, read lips, generate
              realistic facial animations, and code facial movements, which will form a vital
              component in the next generation of human-machine interfaces.
