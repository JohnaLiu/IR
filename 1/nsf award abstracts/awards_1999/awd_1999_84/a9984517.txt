Abstract    :
              The ever-decreasing scale of electronic and micro-electro-mechanical
              devices
(MEMS) indicate that material properties are needed in regimes which
              material
length-scale effects cannot be ignored.  As industry looks towards
              polymers
and new soldering alloys, temperature-dependence and creep behavior
              is of
primary concern.  This program will perform novel rate-
              and
temperate-dependent experiments on length-scales ranging from the
              sub-micron
to macroscopic, and detailed mechanical modeling to establish the
              link between
micro-tests and material properties.  At the core of this
              integrated research
and education plan is the development of novel test
              procedures that will be
implemented into an existing nano-indentation
              facility.  These micro-bend and
micro-torsion tests will be developed within
              existing senior design and
accelerated master's degree programs.  These
              projects will expose students to
the challenges of cutting-edge product
              development and research, and provide
them with considerable technical skills
              not typically found in an
undergraduate program.
