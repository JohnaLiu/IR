Abstract    :
              9984298
This research concerns on the computational and experimental
              characterization of microstructural toughening effects in advanced ceramics.
              Focusing on a new TiB2/Al2O3 ceramic composite system 
with very promising
              properties, it will (1) yield a novel micromechanical approach for explicit
              fracture modeling over multiple size scales, (2) characterize the effects of
              microstructural morphologies, 
phase length scales, constituent properties,
              and interphase bonding on fracture resistance, (3) elucidate the failure modes
              and develop failure models for ceramic composites with microstructures of
              multiple size scales, and (4) identify mechanisms for property enhancement
              through microstructural revisions.Combined modeling and experiments will focus
              on the full, time-dependent process of damage initiation, damage progression
              and failure using time-resolved diagnostics. Experiments will be used to allow
              direct correlation of applied loading, time-resolved response, and microscopic
              damage. The education component of this program consists of undergraduate
              curriculum development at Georgia Tech, outreach to local high school students
              and teachers for recruitment and engineering awareness, outreach to minority
              students for recruitment, and outreach to a local minority institution. The
              curriculum innovation recognizes the drawback of classroom instruction without
              hands-on experimentation in engineering mechanics education. This effort
              focuses on strengthening Georgia Tech's undergraduate curriculum in mechanical
              engineering through proper integration of classroom learning with laboratory
              experimentation. A novel feature of this effort is the use of an experimental
              technique developed in the proposed research to facilitate the development of
              an aptitude for comprehensive engineering analysis. The curriculum innovation
              and outreach will use the facilities also used for research, offering a natural
              synergy of graduate research, undergraduate participation, curriculum
              development, and outreach.
