Abstract    :
              
The PI will utilize the theoretical developments, that he has created during
              his tenure as a Post Doctoral Fellow, for the numerical computations of liquid
              crystal inclusions within a host polymeric fluid.  The Program Director agrees
              with the panel that the new efforts, to be undertaken with the support of this
              CAREER Award, have the promise to make a major impact in the field of materials
              processing.  His educational plan is well articulated and it is expected to
              impact a wide range of students.
