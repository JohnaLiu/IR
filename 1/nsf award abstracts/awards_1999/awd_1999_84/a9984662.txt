Abstract    :
              Sensory systems often map spatial information from the external world onto the
              brain in an orderly way.  For example, in the visual system, cells in the
              retina that receive input from adjacent positions in the visual field make
              connections at adjacent positions in the brain.
This project proposes studying
              the formation of a simple topographic sensory map in the nervous system of the
              nematode C. elegans.  The overall goal of the laboratory is to use genetic and
              molecular methods to understand the formation of this simple map, and then to
              apply this knowledge to more complex vertebrate systems.  Previous studies
              have
identified two genes, dig-1 and mig-10, that have functions required for
              the correct formation of the C. elegans sensory map. Specific goals of the
              current project include studying these genes at the molecular level, in order
              to understand which cells express them and how they function in sensory map
              formation, and using genetic methods to identify other genes
that interact
              with dig-1 and mig-10 in sensory map formation.  
	The educational goal of
              this project is to teach students to think and work
as scientists. Students
              are taught to read and analyze papers from the scientific literature.  They
              learn to design, perform, and interpret experiments, and to communicate their
              results at weekly lab meetings throughout the year; graduate students also
              present their ongoing research at a seminar series on the WPI campus.
              Ultimately, students write up their results in standard scientific format, and
              present them orally, either on campus or at appropriate scientific meetings.
