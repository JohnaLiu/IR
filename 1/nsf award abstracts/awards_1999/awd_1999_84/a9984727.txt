Abstract    :
              A two-pronged approach is proposed to add rigor to the current
state of
              software-engineering knowledge. The research component
focuses on the
              technical design of highly graphical interactive
systems, specifically the
              design decisions required to separate
a graphical user interface from an
              underlying computation.
Currently, the nature of design knowledge in this area
              is
heuristic and anecdotal. The research will clarify and extend
such
              knowledge to produce a deductive, synthetic theory of
composition in graphical
              interactive systems design.
Being synthetic, this theory creates new
              knowledge, specifically
the detailed modular design of separate, but
              composable,
user-interface and functional-core components. This knowledge
is
              synthesized from existing knowledge, specifically an
object-oriented model of
              the objects with which a user will
interact. Being deductive, this theory will
              be rigorous
and repeatable in sharp contrast with its
              technology-laden
predecessors. The theory exploits and generalizes
              prior
results in model-based user-interface generation and
hierarchical
              components. The education component exploits
and facilitates rigorous
              software-engineering knowledge to
enable precise measurement and improvement
              of learning in
undergraduate software-engineering courses. The
approach is
              founded on the use of cognitive objectives,
which have proved useful for
              course improvement
and curriculum design in other engineering
              disciplines.
