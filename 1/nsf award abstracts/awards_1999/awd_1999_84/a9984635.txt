Abstract    :
              The research offers advancements in the accurate representation of natural
              hazard loads for application in structural reliability assessment. The focus is
              on the modeling and simulation of highly correlated non-Gaussian extreme wind
              loads on building components. Modeling efforts will focus on the probability
              content, spatial and temporal coherence, integral effects over large areas,
              transient, and higher-order phenomena associated with extreme wind forces in
              the building envelope. Robust simulation methods will adopt these models, and
              provide a consistent frame-work for applications in reliability analysis. This
              will enhance the impact of reliability methods on hazard resistant design
              through a more realistic treatment of severe loading. Concurrent efforts in
              full-scale hurricane wind measurement near ground level will provide necessary
              data to advance this research. The educational goals are to produce engineers
              prepared to design against natural hazards, and to provide a medium for
              graduate work in this emerging field.
