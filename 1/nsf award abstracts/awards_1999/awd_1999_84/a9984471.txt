This CAREER award goes to a young, new member of the Brandeis
              University physics department.  The award goes to integrate the research and
              education aspects of his career plan.  In research, he plans to carry out
              studies in three different projects: (1) to construct new measures to
              characterize the image data obtained in experiments on turbulent fluid flow and
              turbulent advection.  (2) A study of simple lattice models of globular proteins
              to develop a theory of secondary structure and to study phase transitions
              between different compact states.  The final project consists of (3)
              theoretical understanding of the role played by critical percolation clusters
              in localization of electrons in the quantum Hall effect.  In education, there
              are plans to develop a course on the idea of an effective theory as a universal
              paradigm.  This approach, transcending over the conventional divisions of a
              subject explores the evolution of physical phenomena over different length and
              time scales.

The young, new member of the Brandeis University physics
              department is being supported by this CAREER grant for integration of research
              and education in his career plans.  He plans to teach a course on effective
              theory, i.e. methods and models- how does one develop a theory for a given
              physical phenomena.  His research is all on geometric aspects of statistical
              mechanics.  He wants to provide a measure to an image of a turbulent process. 
              He wants to study globular proteins and their secondary structures.  He also
              wants to study the meandering pathways through which an electron moves, as a
              study in a description of thresholds in quantum Hall effect.
