Abstract    :
              Professor Dickson of the Georgia Institute of Technology will be supported by
              the Experimental Physical Chemistry program as a CAREER awardee.  He will study
              heterogeneous polymer structures utilizing a method he has invented to detect
              fluorescence from very dilute single molecule probes embedded in polymers. 
              This is an advance over previous single molecule methods such as near field
              which suffer from tip interactions with the surface.  Among the topics studied
              will be orientations of polymer-bound molecules, rotational mobility of the
              probe in the polymer, polymer melting and aging.   Single molecule studies
              afford the opportunity to teach students about quantum mechanics.  Starting
              with demonstrations of single molecule phenomena in general chemistry, then
              introducing experiments in physical chemistry laboratory, Professor Dickson
              will incorporate his research into the curriculum in an approachable manner and
              motivate students to learn the quantum chemistry that can explain what they
              observe.

Although plastics are ubiquitous, their material properties are
              poorly understood and can lead to device failure over long times and upon
              exposure to harsh conditions.  Understanding molecular features of plastics
              will allow scientists to overcome these instabilities and produce polymers
              suited for special applications such as molecular electronics and drug
              delivery.  Professor Dickson's research will contribute to these goals.  His
              education plan to integrate single molecule work into the curriculum will
              stimulate and motivate students to learn quantum chemistry.
