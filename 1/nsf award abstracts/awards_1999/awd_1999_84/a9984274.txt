Early embryo development in higher plants has been difficult
              to study because the cells involved are small, few in number, and, in zygotic
              embryogenesis, embedded in several layers of maternal tissues.  Consequently,
              little is known at a molecular level about this stage of development. The
              long-term goal of Dr. Perry's research program is to contribute to an
              understanding of regulatory networks active during embryo development. As an
              initial step towards this goal, the P.I. proposes to further investigate the
              role that the embryo-expressed MADS-domain protein, AGL15 (for AGAMOUS-Like 15)
              plays during this phase of development. MADS-domain proteins are regulatory
              factors that are involved in critical developmental decisions in fungi, animals
              and plants. 
Evidence to date is consistent with a role for AGL15 as a
              DNA-binding regulatory factor involved in global aspects of embryo development.
              To understand AGL15's role in development, genes regulated by AGL15 must be
              identified. Dr. Perry's laboratory will use a chromatin immunoprecipitation
              approach to obtain DNA sequences that directly bind AGL15 in vivo. Because
              AGL15 is divergent from the rest of the MADS-box family, both in sequence and
              in expression pattern, the optimal DNA sequence that AGL15 recognizes will be
              determined using a target detection assay. Further experiments will test
              whether AGL15 is necessary for development in an embryonic mode are also
              proposed. The experiments will contribute to an understanding of molecular
              programs active during embryo and seed development, and this type of
              information will be essential for developing molecular strategies to increase
              agricultural productivity.
Dr. Perry will be involved in developing and
              teaching a new module on Plant Development and Anatomy in PLS 622, Physiology
              of Plants I, a required core course for graduate students in the Plant
              Physiology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology Program. In addition, Dr. Perry
              will participate in PLS 657, Seed Biology, where she will contribute to a
              discussion of molecular and genetic approaches to understanding processes
              during seed development. The P.I. will also serve as a mentor to graduate and
              undergraduate students and to postdoctoral researchers who will be involved in
              the research component of this proposal
