Abstract    :
              The research portion of this CAREER award addresses issues related to modeling
              of catalytic reactors for energy conversion, including catalytic combustors for
              gas turbines and catalytic fuel processors that produce hydrogen for fuel
              cells.  Products include a methodology combining thermogravimetric and
              temperature-programmed reactor studies with a 1-D transient flow model to
              validate multistep surface chemistry mechanisms for methane conversion;
              detailed surface-chemistry mechanisms for methane oxidation over
              zirconia-supported palladium catalysts and reforming and partial oxidation over
              magnesium-aluminate-supported nickel-based catalysts; and a two-dimensional
              transient model for flows over supported catalysts in a monolith reactor, which
              is validated with flat-plate reactor experiments.

This research program on
              catalytic reactions related to energy production is complemented with an
              education component involving development of internet-based workbooks to
              introduce high-school classes to environmental issues related to energy
              production and usage.  These are developed in conjunction with the Center for
              Energy and Environmental Engineering.
