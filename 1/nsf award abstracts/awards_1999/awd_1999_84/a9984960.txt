Abstract    :
              Database query optimizers are large, complex, and error-prone software systems.
              The goal of this project is to assist researchers and developers in building
              optimizers that are "provably correct". Specifically, this research group is
              building a framework which accepts specifications of optimizer components and
              their interactions, and generates optimizers that can be shown to satisfy the
              property that the plans they construct always return the data specified in a
              user queries. The group's approach separates the components of the optimizer
              into those that require correctness proofs (the safety critical components)
              from those that do not. Languages are under design for formally specifying
              those components, and tools are under construction that both generate these
              components according to the specifications, and generate proof obligations
              enabling their verification with an automated theorem prover. The experimental
              research is linked to the educational goal of training students in the
              application of formal methods in building large software systems. The results
              of this project will provide a sandbox for database researchers in both
              academia and industry, to introduce new optimizer techniques and products while
              providing tangible guarantees that they are free of errors.
