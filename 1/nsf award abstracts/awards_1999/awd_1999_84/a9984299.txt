Abstract    :
              This research studies asynchronous computer architecture as a means to tackle
              three major challenges facing modern computer architects: power dissipation in
              high-performance architectures, correctness on first silicon, and system
              integration. The project addresses the following issues: (a) the development of
              a framework for the optimization of power and performance in asynchronous
              designs; (b) the design of asynchronous architectural components having varied
              power/performance characteristics; (c) the design of tools that analyze
              asynchronous systems for their ease of pipelining in support of the formal
              synthesis approach to asynchronous design; and (d) the extension of the
              asynchronous formal synthesis methodology to heterogeneous systems.
