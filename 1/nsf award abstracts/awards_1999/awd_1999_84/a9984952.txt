Abstract    :
              This is the first year of funding of a 4-year continuing award. This project
              adopts a decision theoretic approach to problems of intelligent planning and
              control, especially problems that are characterized by uncertainty and
              imperfect information. One focus of this research is the development of
              improved algorithms for problems that are formalized as Markov decision
              processes and/or influence diagrams. An innovative approach is adopted in which
              plans (or policies) are represented as finite automata, and classic AI search
              and planning techniques for finding sequential plans are generalized to find
              more complex conditional plans that take the form of automata. This should lead
              to more efficient planning algorithms by exploiting problem structure in the
              form of factored representations, as well as hierarchical and distributed
              problem decomposition. A complementary focus of this project is the application
              of decision-theoretic techniques to, practical problems, including planning the
              process of knowledge discovery in a large oceanographic image database, and
              dynamic load balancing of scientific computations in a parallel, distributed
              memory environment. This research will result in more efficient algorithms for
              decision-theoretic planning and control that can solve larger and more complex
              problems. It will also result in an improved understanding of how to apply
              these algorithms and models to practical applications.
