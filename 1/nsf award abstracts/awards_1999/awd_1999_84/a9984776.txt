Abstract    :
              This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
              program supports research on the synthesis and characterization of well-defined
              low valent titanium compounds by Professor Folami Ladipo of the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Kentucky.  The work involves the synthesis of
              soluble Ti(II) and Ti(III) complexes supported by calix[4]arene-derived 
              bis(aryloxide) ligands, the elucidation of their structure and the
              determination of their redox properties. The reaction chemistry of these
              synthons with alkynes, alkenes, imines and carbonyl  compounds will be
              examined, and correlations established between the steric and electronic
              properties of the low-valent titanium reductants and their ability to promote
              chemo-and diastero-selective C-C bond formation. This knowledge will lead to
              the development of new reductants which operate under well-understood
              mechanisms.

The goal of this research is to produce and characterize new
              complexes of titanium in low oxidation states which can be used as selective
              reducing agents in the synthesis of industrially and medically important
              organic compounds. In addition, some of the titanium reagents themselves are
              expected to possess useful catalytic properties. Considerable emphasis is being
              placed on undergraduate education, and inorganic course offerings at the
              University of Kentucky will be revamped. A cooperative arrangement with
              Youngstown State University has been established which will bring undergraduate
              students, particularly women and minorities, into the graduate pipeline.
