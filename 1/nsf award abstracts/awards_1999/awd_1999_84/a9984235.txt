Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project will further develop
              the passive acoustic system to non-destructively pressure test concrete water
              pipelines.  It will locate points of structural weakness in these water pipes
              to permit reinforcement, and in so doing it will avoid the costs and
              consequences of catastrophic ruptures. The established goals of the project
              include:  (1) Autonomous Hydrophone System Enhancement - The AH-3 acoustic test
              system developed and demonstrated during Phase I will be enhanced to
              incorporate those improvements that will make the system commercially viable; 
              (2) Pipeline Distress Research - The characteristics of concrete pressure water
              pipe deterioration will be replicated under field conditions in cooperation
              with one of the major pipe manufacturers. This will provide greater insight
              into the process of pipe deterioration as well as providing a proving ground
              for the field testing of the acoustic system;  (3)  Commercial Feasibility -
              The research has the potential to greatly prolong the useful life and
              reliability of the $40 billion U.S. water pipeline infrastructure.  PTI has
              seen significant growth in revenue fueled in part by commercial acceptance of
              its early technology.
