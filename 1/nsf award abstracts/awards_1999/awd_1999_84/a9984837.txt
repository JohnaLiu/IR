Abstract    :
              The objective of the research under this CAREER award is to advance the
              basic
understanding of thermomechanically induced damage and deformation in
              layered
surface structures whose purposes are to provide engineering and
              electronic
materials with enhanced properties and functionality.  Although
              often discussed
in terms of high temperature applications, there have been
              relatively few
investigations into the thermomechanical loading responses of
              layered surface
structures.  In order to discover fundamental relationships
              between load,
damage, and failure, the proposed research will apply advanced
              experimental and
numerical techniques to the study of advanced thermal barrier
              coatings.  The
improved understanding could have significant consequences in
              the continued
development of propulsion and energy conversion systems.

The
              education and outreach components of the project will focus on organized
high
              school visitations, undergraduate tutoring, undergraduate and
              graduate
mentoring, development of web modules, and course development.  The
              PI's
interests in state-of-the-art technology and in how new discovery takes
              place
will be emphasized
