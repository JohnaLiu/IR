This CAREER project
              will integrate the tools of molecular biology with the principles of adaptive
              physiology at a small liberal arts school where undergraduates will have the
              opportunity to work in a research laboratory.  The restriction of caloric
              intake has been shown in numerous animal systems to lower blood pressure.  Dr.
              Swoap and his students will use a telemetry-based blood pressure system to
              measure the blood pressure of animals with known germline mutations.  These
              mutations will be in genes that are known to regulate body mass homeostasis. 
              In addition, animals will be chronically instrumented with cannulas in the
              brain to analyze results from testing the role of leptin signaling pathways in
              blood pressure regulation.  This research on blood pressure regulation during
              caloric restriction is well suited for undergraduate research projects.  The
              combination of using physiological techniques on transgenic animals provides an
              opportunity for undergraduates to initiate a research project and start
              producing novel results and new fundamental information in a short time.
