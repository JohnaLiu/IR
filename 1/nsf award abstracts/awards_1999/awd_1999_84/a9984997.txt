Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support to continue the University of Michigan group's
              ongoing research program on the L3 experiment at the CERN LEP collider and to
              increase the research and development effort in preparation for a new
              high-energy electron-positron linear collider (LC).

The L3 experiment is now
              taking LEP II data above the W+W- threshold, allowing precise measurement of W
              boson properties, most notably in mass and couplings, and allowing searches for
              new particles, especially the Higgs boson in both the Standard Model and
              supersymmetry.  The group intends to continue to participate in L3 data taking
              through the end of LEP running (expected to be fall 2000) and intends to
              complete L3 analysis work in mid to late 2001.  This group will concentrate on
              the search for the Higgs boson, exploring both Standard Model and
              supersymmetric signatures.

One leading option for the next major accelerator
              in the world after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) currently being built at the
              CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland is an electron-positron linear collider
              with a collision energy equal to or greater than 500 GeV.  This would be a
              natural next step in lepton colliders after LEP II completion.  This group has
              taken leadership roles in LC physics and detector studies since 1995 and plans
              to increase its efforts substantially in the coming years.  In particular, they
              are focussed on R&D for an LC detector tracking system.  Initial work is
              concentrated on determining the physics requirements of the Higgs search on
              tracker design.  Later work will shift towards R&D on a tracker that meets
              these requirements
