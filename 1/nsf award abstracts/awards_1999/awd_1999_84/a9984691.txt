Abstract    :
              This CAREER project focuses on ferroelectric lithium niobate (LiNbO3 ) and
              lithium tantalate (LiTaO3 ) relevant to integrated and nonlinear optics.  The
              approach is to directly probe the structure and dynamics of ferroelectric
              domains in LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 by real-time, in-situ, and nondestructive probes.
              The proposed studies seek new information and understanding in the areas of (1)
              Real-time tracking of the motion of individual domain walls under electric
              fields in single crystals on nano-to-millisecond time scales by Electro-Optic
              Imaging Microscopy. (2) In-situ probing of the evolution of domain statistics
              in thin films with electric field and temperature by Second harmonic Generation
              measurements. (3) Probing domain wall pinning, bending and depinning processes
              on submicroscopic length scales using Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscopy
              (NSOM) and Scanning Force Microscopy (SFM).  Fundamental insights into the
              classical problems of domain wall structure, wall mobilities, merger dynamics,
              and pinning-depinning interactions between a domain wall and lattice defects
              are sought, and will be utilized to achieve more effective techniques to shape
              and control ferroelectric domains.

The project addresses fundamental
              research issues in a topical area of materials science having high
              technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science,
              physics, and engineering knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects
              of electronic/photonic materials and advanced devices/circuits. The scope of
              the project will expose students to challenges in materials synthesis,
              processing, and characterization. An important feature of the project is the
              strong emphasis on education, and on the integration of research and
              education.
