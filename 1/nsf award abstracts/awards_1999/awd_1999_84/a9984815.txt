Abstract    :
              Farb will continue his joint work with L. Mosher on understanding the asymptotic
              geometry of groups. Every finitely-generated group can be viewed as a metric
              space in a way which is unique up to maps of bounded distortion.  It was
              recently discovered that many finitely-generated groups are actually determined
              uniquely by their asymptotic geometry.  Farb plans to continue his work on
              this
phenomenon and how it relates to the Mostow Rigidity Theorem, Gromov's
              Polynomial Growth Theorem, and the theory of dynamical systems.  Farb will also
              develop and teach a geometry component in Chicago's SESAME program.  This
              program teaches mathematics and science to elementary
teachers from the
              Chicago public school system, and provides them with curriculum tools they can
              take back to their schools for use in their classrooms.


Groups are the
              formal mathematical way to describe symmetry.  What symmetries can a space
              exhibit?  How do the symmetries of a space relate to its geometry, and to the
              way that geodesics (light-rays) travel in that space?  These are fundamental
              issues that occur throughout nature.  The mathematical underpinnings of the
              theory of symmetry are important not only in understanding known phenomena, but
              in discovering new ones.  One example is the recently discovered phenomenon
              that the coarse, large-scale geometric structure of a space can often determine
              the symmetries it can have.
