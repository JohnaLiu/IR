Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is on the synthetic use of oligopeptides assembled on
              the surface of glass particles through a spacer that can be cleaved by light. 
              The resulting polyamides will be modified by the introduction of functionality
              into the polymer, N-terminus modification with a group that projects back
              towards the origin of the peptide and incorporation of amino acids predisposed
              towards specialized reactivity.Further alterations brought about by the use of
              radical chain transfer chemistry and soluble transition-metal catalyzed
              carbon-heteroatom bond formation will lead to compounds with potentially
              interesting biological properties.  Release of the compounds into aqueous
              medium can be accomplished with light.  A new graduate curriculum providing a
              strong foundation of organic chemistry and involving a balance of
              interdisciplinary and specialized courses will be developed. 

With this
              CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Program is supporting the research
              and educational activities of Dr. Patrick G. Harran of the Department of
              Biochemistry at the University of Texas Southwest Texas Medical Center. 
              Professor Harran will focus his research on the  development of methods for the
              synthesis of complex, natural product-like materials beginning with arrays of
              linear peptides.  The project affords a novel approach for the production of
              pharmacophores.  Dr. Harran will focus his educational efforts on developing a
              new graduate curriculum for students working at the interface of modern biology
              and chemistry.
