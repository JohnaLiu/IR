Abstract    :
              The growing use of both microprocessors and FPGAs to implement digital systems
              illustrates the trend towards programmable, commodity hardware and product
              differentiation through software.  Unfortunately, FPGAs lack the abstract model
              that makes software design practical, and microprocessor architectures lack
              spatial relationships between operators that are essential to performance in
              interconnect-dominated technology.  This project is developing abstractions
              that hardware designers can use to make their designs portable and scalable
              into deep-submicron processes.  In addition, this project is exploring how
              these abstractions can be leveraged within a standard processor architecture to
              exploit the massive parallelism of media-centric computing.  The goals of this
              project are to: (1) develop hardware virtualization techniques that apply to a
              broader class of applications than the strict hardware pipelines supported by
              PipeRench, (2) improve the scalability of these programmable architectures by
              localizing interconnect without sacrificing "compile-ability" or performance,
              and to (3) understand how these techniques can be leveraged within the context
              of a standard microprocessor.
