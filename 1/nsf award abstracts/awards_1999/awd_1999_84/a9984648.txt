The research program of this career award seeks to advance our
              ability to safely preserve and store liver replacement devices at low
              temperature such that a inventory of viable hepatocytes is readily available
              when the need for liver support arises.  Cryopreservation technology -- or the
              low term storage of cells, tissue, and organs -- has permitted a variety of
              cells and tissues to be safely stored at subzero temperatures for future use,
              yet has not be reported for liver replacement devices.  Development of
              appropriate cryopreservation protocols for these devices requires a
              understanding of the mechanisms by which cell survival can be enhanced after
              exposure to low temperatures.  The specific aims of this work are to: (1)
              quantify key physiochemical properties important to the successful preservation
              of a hepatocyte/collagen system, as a function of temperature; (2)  investigate
              the influence of matrix protein density on hepatocyte survival after
              cryopreservation; and (3) computationally predict the effects of configuration,
              volume, and time on the survival of hepatocytes during cryopreservation of
              hepatic-collagen constructs.

The educational component of this award links
              the research training the students receive with coursework developed expressly
              to encourage effective interdisciplinary and team interactions.   Education
              through these complementary avenues will aid the students in becoming the
              developers of future industry and research innovations. The three  educational
              objectives of this award contribute to this goal through new course
              development, training in interdisciplinary teamwork and problem solving, and
              mentorship.
