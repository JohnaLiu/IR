Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop an integrated research and education
              program in electric power distrubution systems.  Power distrubution systems are
              large-scale, low-voltage electric networks.  They are composed of individual
              loads, power sources and the pyhsical components that connect them together.  A
              unified approach toward electric power distribution systems research and
              education encompassing the interdependent areas of theory, practical
              applications and the performance of those applications is purposed.  The desire
              to automate functions in electric power distribution systems have never been
              greater.  Restructuring of the electric utilities has resulted in a renewed
              outlook toward customer satisfaction and public perception.  In order to
              maintain and improve reliability, as well as to obtain the ability to provide
              information to the public, electric distribution companies are looking to
              automate select functions in their distribution networks.  Successful
              wide-scale implementation of distribution automation begins with a
              comprehensive understanding of the distribution system itself.  This project
              sttempts to develop an integrated theoretical and software framework for
              progress in this area.
