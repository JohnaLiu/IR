Abstract    :
              The current understanding of colloidal forces generally assumes that the charges
              on particles are uniformly distributed. A nonuniform charge distribution will
              significantly alter interparticle forces. The research goals are:  the
              nanoscale charge nonuniformity will be measured on individual colloidal
              particles of micron size; and the charge nonuniformity on colloidal particles
              will be related to the measured normal and tangential colloidal forces between
              the particles. This research was prompted in part by recent data from the PI
              that shows time-dependent tangential colloidal forces acting between two
              non-touching particles that could result from a nonuniform charge distribution.
              Charge nonuniformity could have a major impact on the modeling of bulk
              suspension stability and rheology.

The charge nonuniformity on individual
              particles will be measured by combining microelectrophoresis experiments,
              electrokinetic theory, and Monte Carlo simulations.  The charge nonuniformity
              on particles will be related to the forces between particles. Using the
              recently-developed technique of "differential electrophoresis", the normal
              forces can be measured between two particles (those forces acting along the
              line of centers) and the tangential forces between them (those forces acting
              laterally along adjacent surfaces of the particles) with sub-piconewton
              resolution. Differential electrophoresis can measure interparticle forces
              between two Brownian particles at gaps less than 100 nanometers, where van der
              Waals forces are important.
