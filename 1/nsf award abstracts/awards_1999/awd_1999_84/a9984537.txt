Abstract    :
              

The ability to change and control precisely material properties
              of
semiconductors by several orders of magnitude has revolutionized
              our
information age. While the research in semiconductor devices in the
              last
40 years has been concentrated on the optimization and control of
              the
opto-electronic properties, there has only been a limited work
              on
thermo-electric properties. In this research program, we propose to
              use
same techniques of bandgap engineering and thin film epitaxy to
              improve
the thermal characteristics and design novel high
              performance
optoelectronic components. The core of proposed research is based
              on the
fact that semiconductor heterostructures and superlattices can
              modify
the average transport energy of electrons beyond what can be
              achieved
using bulk material. Such modifications in conjunction with
              judicious
choice of device parameters can make the electron gas absorb
              thermal
energy from one area in the device and deposit it in another area near
              a
heat sink. The integrated electrical, optical and thermal approach
              gives
the opportunity to improve the performance of existing devices.
              As
specific examples, we will study the design of light emitting diodes
              and
high power semiconductor lasers in which the device performance is
              least
affected by ambient temperature changes.  This research will
              be
integrated in an undergraduate class on Properties of Materials. In
              this
class, students will perform simple transport measurements such as
              heat
conduction, Hall or Peltier effect. Through the graphical
              representation
of the transport equation developed for the research part of
              this
proposal, students will be able to see how the electron gas is
              moving
through the semiconductor, why there is Wiedemann-Franz law, and
              how
passage from one semiconductor to another one gives rise to
              Peltier
effect.
