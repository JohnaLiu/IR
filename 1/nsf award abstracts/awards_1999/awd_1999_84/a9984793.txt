Abstract    :
              
This CAREER award is made to advance both research and education
              in
engineering.  The research is to study the microscopic features of
              physical
mechanisms and their relations with macroscopic cyclic mechanical
              behavior in
polycrystalline metallic materials near room temperature.  The
              goal is to
bridge practical stress analysis with fundamental findings in
              material
science.  The education plan consists of innovative teaching and
              developing
undergraduate and graduate courses.  A systematic pilot research
              program will
be created to involve undergraduate students in research projects
              to provide
early exposure to practical problems.  Self-directed and open-ended
              laboratory
experiments will be developed to encourage the students to be more
              creative.
