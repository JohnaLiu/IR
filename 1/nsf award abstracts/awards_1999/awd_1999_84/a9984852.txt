Abstract    :
              It is well known that storage systems are becoming one of the biggest obstacles
              for many high-performance applications, due to the ever-widening speed gap
              between CPU and disks.  The goal of this research is to overcome the
              performance limitation of traditional storage systems by developing and
              studying novel high performance, scalable, distributed storage systems. The
              research in this project will develop architectures of high-performance
              distributed storage systems that are scalable with a number of disks, with
              easy-to-use Application Programming Interfaces and high resource utilization.
              Moreover, data placing algorithms, which can perform dynamical load balancing
              and performance optimization, will be studied.  To further improve the I/O
              performance, the project will design distributed I/O cache architectures that
              can significantly reduce I/O read and write cost and benefit a wide range of
              workloads.  Educational activities will include: developing new graduate-level
              courses that emphasize specially on the close interaction between computer
              architectures and operating systems; teaching paper reading, critical analysis
              and presentation skills for students; and integrating research and
              education.
