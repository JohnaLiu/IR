Abstract    :
              This research will advance the theoretical foundations and 
explore practical
              implementations of dependable distributed 
system technology. A distributed
              system is dependable, when 
it provides guarantees regarding its performance,
              fault-
tolerance, correctness and compositionality.
The research objectives
              will be achieved through synergy 
between the research in distributed systems
              with its focus 
on fault-tolerance and correctness, the research in 
parallel
              computing with its focus on speed-up and 
efficiency, and the practical
              engineering considerations of 
specification, development, deployment and
              performance of 
systems. This proposal envelops three investigation
              areas:
(1) Robust Algorithmics: Development of fault-tolerant and 
efficient
              distributed algorithms and exploration of 
limitations on achieving robustness
              in distributed 
computing.
(2) Building Blocks: Definition and analysis of
              dependable 
distributed building blocks needed by applications 
requiring
              precise guarantees; and design of specification 
frameworks for capturing
              designs and optimizing distributed 
system deployment.
(3) Distributed
              Implementation: Development of exploratory 
implementations of compositional
              building blocks and robust 
algorithms, and evaluation of their performance in
              
realistic and simulated settings; empirical evaluations 
will complement the
              analytically established efficiency 
characterizations.
The educational
              component includes: developing and 
delivering new courses in distributed
              computing in support 
of undergraduate and graduate programs in computer
              science; 
and, building a research group that attracts graduate 
students and
              postdoctoral researchers.
