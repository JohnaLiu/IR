Abstract    :
              The CAREER award is made to advance both research and education in engineering. 
              The researchis to study the microscopic features of physical mechanisms and
              their relations with macroscopic cyclic mechancial behavior in polycrystalline
              metallic materials near room temperature.  The goal is to bridge practical
              stress analysis with fundamental findings in material science.  The education
              plan consists of innovative teaching and developing undergraduate and graduate
              cuorses.  A systematic pilot research program will be created to involve
              undergraduate students in research projects to provide early exposure to
              practical problems.  Self-directed and open-ended laboratory experiments will
              be developed to encourage the students to be more creative.
