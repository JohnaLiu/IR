Abstract    :
              This project will investigate genetic variation and diversity in insular and
              relatively young Arctic lakes and ponds.  The endemic polyploid crustacean
              (Bosmina) will be examined.  Individuals from among the Arctic polyploid
              lineages and 10 temperate parent taxa will be used for studies of co-dominant
              nuclear markers, inter-simple sequence repeats, 28D rDNS sequences,
              mitochondrial DNA sequences, and morphology.  Lake cores will be used to
              examine morphologies of individuals over geological time.  These results would
              allow an identification of ancestors of the Arctic lineages and would constrain
              the mechanisms leading to observed diversity.   An educational component would
              involve the establishment of an undergraduate college field course at Resolute
              Canada.
