CAREER: Automated annotation of Functional Pathways using
              Eukaryotic cDNA Sequence Data



This project will build a system that can
              be used by biologists either on local machines or accessed over the Web to
              analyze arbitrarily large numbers of novel cDNA sequences, to integrate the
              analysis with microarray expression data and to organize cDNAs according to
              functional relatedness. Assembled eukaryotic cDNA sequences will be analyzed to
              satisfy two goals:
1. To identify interdependent cDNAs that can be annotated
              as components of the same or connected metabolic and signaling pathways,
              and
2. To identify cDNAs of unknown function but with evolutionary or genomic
              properties that indicate a relationship to known components or pathways.
The
              work will be carried out in two phases; phase one will build a functional
              annotation system for eukaryotic cDNA based on the MAGPIE genome annotation
              environment, phase two will build additional modules to carry out
              post-annotation analysis of patterns of evolution and genome organization. The
              research program will also serve as the foundation for the construction of 
              training courses entitled "Principles of Genome Annotation" and "Principles of
              Biological Database Design"
