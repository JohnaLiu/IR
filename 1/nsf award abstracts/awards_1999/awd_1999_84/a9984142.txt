Abstract    :
              This project comprises a career development plan of integrated educational and
              research activities.  The research project is aimed at finding ligands or
              "caps" for exposed Watson-Crick-paired bases at the termini of oligonucleotide
              duplexes.  They are expected to enhance mismatch discrimination by creating a
              molecular environment that mimics the interior of duplexes.  The project will
              involve the synthesis of 3'- and 5'-amino terminal nucleotides and their
              incorporation into duplexes.  Physical characterization of the anticipated
              effects will be made using spectrometrically monitored selection experiments,
              mismatch binding studies, and NMR experiments.

With this CAREER Award, the
              Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Dynamics Program
              supports the research and educational activities of Professor Clemens Richert
              of Tufts University.   Professor Richert's research activities are directed
              toward an understanding of ways to make DNA strand pairs more robust, so that
              their use in laboratory experiments can be carried out under a greater variety
              of conditions and with greater efficiency.  The project incorporates
              educational activities that are designed to bring discussions of scientific
              ethics into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum and, on the graduate level,
              to introduce students to the new science of combinatorial chemistry.
