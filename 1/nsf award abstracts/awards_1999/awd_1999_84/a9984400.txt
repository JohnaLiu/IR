Abstract    :
              This project will develop a new class of robust and
              parallelizable
preconditioners for the solution of sparse linear systems
              arising from
partial differential equations. The approach is based on a
              hierarchical
decomposition of the matrices associated with the linear system,
              and is
designed to improve the effectiveness of the preconditioner
              without
compromising the parallelism inherent in the computation. A
              formal
methodology will be developed for construction, application,
              and
analysis of these preconditioners.  Effectiveness of these
              techniques
will be tested on problems in incompressible fluid simulations.
              Parallel
implementations of these preconditioners will be developed and
              their
performance evaluated for various multiprocessor platforms.
              Parallel
libraries will also be developed and made available to others via
              the
internet. As part of the educational plan innovative techniques will
              be
employed for curriculum development in computational science
              and
engineering, and university wide workshops and seminars will be
organized
              for the research community.
