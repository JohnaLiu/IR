Abstract    :
              This is a CAREER award to a young member of the faculty at the Louisiana State
              University.  The PI plans to study morphological instabilities and evolution of
              microstructures in thin films and ceramics.  There is a second project on
              diffusion controlled growth of a compound phase AnB between two parallel thin
              films of material A and B.  Furthermore, following LSU's interest in starting
              an education and research program in materials science and engineering, the PI
              proposes to intiate a virtual Materials Center on Internet.  The virtual center
              will serve to: (1) Introduce and attract undergraduate students to materials
              science and engineering, (2) Provide a teaching tool for undergraduate
              laboratory instruction, (3) Coordinate education and research efforts in the
              state of Louisiana and (4) Schedule equipment use at LSU.  The PI is also
              planning to introduce two courses, focusing on analytical and numerical
              techniques applied to real materials related problems, for graduate and
              undergraduate students.

Thin films are an integral part of the current
              high technology.  There are a number of issues related to the role of defects
              in the processing of thin films.  How are the defects formed and how do they
              grow.   These are critical to a number of materials related precesses such as
              preparation of electronic materials, healing of cracks in ceramics and the
              compacting involved during sintering.  This PI plans to develop an academic
              career supported by this CAREER grant and consisting of research on these
              areas.  The education plan includes two courses, each involving a judicious mix
              of mathematics and computers for undergraduate and graduate students in
              materials.  In addition the PI has proposed to setup a webpage to inform and
              attract young undergraduates to LSU's materials program.
