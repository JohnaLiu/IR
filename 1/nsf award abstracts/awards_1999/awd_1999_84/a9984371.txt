TITLE: CAREER: Slice-Processing:
              Highly-Accurate Prediction for Future High-Performance
              Processors
ABSTRACT
Prediction-driven speculative techniques are used in
              virtually all modern, high-
performance processors. Such techniques offer a
              promising direction for further
boosting performance. However, the benefits so
              obtained are only as good as the
underlying prediction-based methods are at
              guessing what the program needs.
This project investigates slice-prediction, a
              paradigm that aims at providing
highly accurate prediction beyond what is
              possible with the existing methods.
Existing methods are primarily
              outcome-based since they rely on repeating
patterns in a program's outcome
              stream (e.g., addresses or branch directions).
However, such patterns do not
              always exist. More importantly, as current
outcome-based methods are
              perfected, irregular patterns increasingly dominate
performance.
              Slice-prediction attacks such cases by predicting the computation-
slice that
              produces such irregular yet performance-critical outcomes. Predicted
slices
              are then treated as miniature, autonomous programs, which can
              precompute
performance critical outcomes. The intuition is that while the
              outcome of a
program can be irregular the method used is typically relatively
              simple and
fairly stable.
This project focuses on architecturally invisible,
              hardware implementations of
slice-prediction, and targets the following
              applications: (1) Branch Prediction
and (2) Data Prefetching. Performance
              achieved by slice-prediction is evaluated
through a detailed software
              simulator over a set of widely used benchmarks.
