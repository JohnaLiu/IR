Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to study protein folding by examining protein
              folding intermediates that are critical branching points for aggregation side
              reactions as well as mutagenic and physical means for disfavoring these side
              reactions.  The specific project aims are to: (1) measure individual rate
              constants and develop a mechanistic model for formation of tailspike
              aggregation and assembly intermediates, (2) identify the rate controlling steps
              and develop strategies to inhibit and reverse tailspike aggregation, and (3)
              measure secondary structure and supermolecular morphology of aggregates using
              circular dichroism and atomic force microscopy.
