Project Abstract: 
This research seeks to expand the understanding of
              various critical phenomena in vehicular traffic flow and develops improved
              theories to model them. Comprising of heterogeneous intelligent "particles"
              -vehicles driven by diverse people, traffic flow exhibits complex dynamic
              patterns. Although some aspect of traffic flow, such as shock waves, is well
              understood and supports the well known traffic flow theory of kinematic waves,
              many other phenomena that are critical to traffic flow applications are not
              well understood. These include the laminar flow to stop-and-go flow
              transitions, stop-start waves, and phantom traffic jams. This research proposes
              to 1) better understand the nature of the aforementioned critical phenomena, 2)
              develop improved traffic theories to model these phenomena, and 3) apply the
              developed theories to better manage traffic congestion and reduce vehicle
              emissions. In the research, experimental evidence is carefully examined and
              past developments of traffic flow theory are scrutinized to gain insights on
              driver behavior and possible directions of new theory development. Improved
              theories are then developed based on a sound understanding of both driver
              behavior and existing theories, rigorously analyzed and carefully validated
              with experimental data. The success of this research can lead to a better
              understanding of traffic flow and greatly increase the ability to monitor,
              model and control traffic flow. These advances in turn lead to more efficient
              use of existing road infrastructure and better air quality planning.
