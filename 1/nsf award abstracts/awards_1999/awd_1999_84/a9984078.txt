Abstract    :
              The performance of distributed information systems is becoming increasingly
              unpredictable.  Past approaches to this problem either handle only a subset of
              root causes, or introduce new difficulties of their own.  This project proposes
              fluid replication --- the automatic creation and placement of replicas in
              response to changing client demands and network capacities --- as a solution to
              this problem.  These replicas are held on WayStations, which are
              infrastructural service nodes that can act as replica sites for both local and
              visiting users.  The objective of this research is to construct four key
              mechanisms to enable fluid replication:  an estimator for end-to-end network
              performance, a scalable scheme to locate WayStations, techniques for
              consistency management between WayStations and remote servers, and efficient
              client migration from one replica site to another.  Prototypes of these
              mechanisms will be evaluated with standard workloads in both experimental and
              deployed networking testbeds.  With these mechanisms, fluid replication
              promises to automatically match available resources to offered load.  This
              reduces cost of administration, increases utilization of resources, and
              delivers improved performance to end-users.
