Abstract    :
              A novel approach to study nonlinear optical interactions is proposed.  This
              approach is based on recently developed methods for optical pulse shaping,
              adaptive learning experiment and advanced optical pulse shape characterization
              techniques.  Initial experiments on second harmonic generation, optical
              parametric amplification and nonlinear optical pulse propagation in optical
              fibers are suggested for evaluation of this new direction of nonlinear optical
              studies.  Interdisciplinary approach to education and research represents the
              strategic direction of PI's career development.  A unique research environment,
              which aims interdisciplinary and interinstutitional collaboration, will promote
              the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students.
