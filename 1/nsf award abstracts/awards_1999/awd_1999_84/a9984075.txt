Abstract    :
              This CAREER award focuses on the physics of trapped charged particles.  The
              research component examines the physics of Kingdon and Paul traps from the
              viewpoint of classical and quantum chaos.  A new trap, the cryston trap, is
              proposed to create beams of unprecedented quality and brilliance.  The PI will
              develop a new course entitled, "Wall of Pure Energy", which will discuss many
              of the most exciting new developments in physics and use trap physics as an
              illustration of the classical and quantum phenomena discussed in the lectures. 
              Finally, the PI has built two Beowulf clusters at the university using
              undergraduates and will continue his work in training students in parallel
              computation.
