Abstract    :
              
The proposed research consists of work to characterize and model the
behavior
              of nonclassical materials exhibiting strong multi-field
interactions. In
              particular, recent experiments of certain shape memory
alloys has shown strain
              localization and subtle thermo-mechanical
interactions, for which no
              definitive models are yet available. The scope
of these experiments will be
              extended to include cyclic loading,
multi-axial loading, and higher strain
              rates. The objective will be to
develop thermodynamically based models that
              admit the possibility of
unstable mechanical behavior consistent with these
              experiments. The
educational component of this work will foster undergraduate
              and graduate
students' awareness of these non-classical materials through
              design/build
projects and new offered classes.
