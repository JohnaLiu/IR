Abstract    :
              he focus of this research is the biomimetic diversity-based synthesis of
              millions of compounds that resemble benzoxanthenone class of natural products. 
              The project will produce some of the most complex molecules yet constructed on
              the solid-phase in a split-pool library format.  The resulting collections will
              be screened for novel biological properties such as inhibitors of the cell
              cycle machinery or activators of signalling pathways.  The educational
              component of the project focuses on outreach at the K-12 level and course
              development at the undergraduate and graduate level.  Course content will
              stress diversity-based approaches at the interface between organic chemistry
              and biology. 

With this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr.
              Matthew D. Shair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard
              University.  Professor Shair will focus his research on the diversity-based
              synthesis of new molecules with novel biological properties.  The educational
              portion of the project focuses on the theme of chemistry and interdisciplinary
              research.  The project will stress the use of chemistry and organic synthesis
              to probe the most interesting questions in the life sciences.
