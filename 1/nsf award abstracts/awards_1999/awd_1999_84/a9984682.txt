Abstract    :
              The proposed research focuses on the application of a global time base toward
              development and control of widely geographically dispersed applications. 
              Recently available hardware, base on the Global Positioning System, is able to
              track the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) scale within a few microseconds. 
              The clocks of processors worldwide can then be kept within tens of microseconds
              of each other via their mutual synchronization to UTC.  Time-based protocols
              for the monitoring and control of distributed computations will be developed,
              including protocols for the detection and resolution of distributed deadlock,
              detection of the occurrence of certain unstable predicates at a point in time
              during a computation, and techniques for the monitoring and control of dynamic
              systems.  Additionally, the project will seek out new applications facilitated
              by this technology, as tight synchronization of widely dispersed processor
              clocks was not feasible prior to the appearance of this hardware.  Development
              protocols will be experimentally evaluated within a GPS-synchronized wide area
              network.  The project will result in techniques that enhance the development
              and control of widely dispersed computations, including distributed databases
              and multimedia applications.  These time-based techniques will be incorporated
              as part of an undergraduate course in the design of secure and reliable
              networked applications.
