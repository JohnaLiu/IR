Abstract    :
              This CAREER award to Professor Louis Lyon of the Georgia Institute of Technology
              is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry
              Division.  The primary research objective is to develop a new class of
              bioresponsive materials that undergo large and rapid volume-phase transitions
              in response to specific biological stimuli.  The long range goal of this
              project is to develop new biosensor platforms based on colloidal or thin film
              hydrogels.   Such platforms will be of interest in the study of the fundamental
              chemistry and physics of macromolecule systems and has the potential for use as
              sensors and diagnostic tools.  The educational aspect of this program will
              develop a new curriculum that will include macromolecule topics in a variety of
              classes. 

This project focuses on developing a new class of biosensors based
              of the swelling of certain bioresponsive materials when contacted with specific
              biological stimuli. The resulting sensors could potentially be used as
              biological diagnostic tools.
