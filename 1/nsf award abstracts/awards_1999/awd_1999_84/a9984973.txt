Abstract    :
              This Faculty Early Career Development Program award to Dr. Daniel Feldheim of
              North Carolina State University is supported by the Advanced Materials and
              Processing Program in the Chemistry Division.  The focus of the research will
              be the preparation of polymer-coated gold colloids and subsequent removal of
              the gold core resulting in hollow polymer nanocapsules. Polypyrrole and
              N-methylpyrrole will be synthesized for the preparation of polymer-gold
              particles. The hollow polymer nanocapsules will be evaluated for uptake,
              release and entrapment of molecules, and establish structure-function
              relationships between the polymer capsules and the entrapped molecules.  The
              educational part of the program is to provide cross-disciplinary research
              experience to undergraduate students with monthly meetings and presentations
              including invited speakers from industry and academia.

Multifunctional
              polymer capsules will be prepared to encapsulate small molecules for controlled
              release or activity with potential applications in time-released drug delivery
              systems. The teaching part of the award will develop an undergraduate research
              program with support from industry and former NC State chemistry graduates to
              better prepare the students for careers in chemistry.
