Abstract    :
              This is the first year of funding of a 4 year continuing award. The PI will
              explore new ways that technology can enhance education without becoming the
              focus of the educational experience. The central goal is to help teachers get
              students interested in or even excited about careers in math and science. To
              this end, the PI will develop strategies and software that support the
              development of tangible interfaces for collaborative learning environments.
              Such interfaces enable the computer to "watch" as children work together on
              puzzles and other educational tasks in a physical environment, and to then act
              as a "guide on the side" that encourages and prods much as a teacher would. The
              PI will build on her earlier effort that produced a prototype Tangram puzzle
              which uses computer vision techniques to track the puzzle pieces and offers
              encouragement and guidance as is appropriate. Issues to be addressed in the
              current project include tracking multiple objects simultaneously using low cost
              technologies, and expressing 3D topological relations uniquely. Evaluation of
              this prototype and its extensions, conducted at the Goudreau Museum of
              Mathematics in Art and Science, will guide the evolution of the ideas and
              software, in this effort, which will ultimately create tools that enable
              instructors to develop their own tangible interfaces for collaborative learning
              environments. This software will be made publicly available via the world wide
              web.
