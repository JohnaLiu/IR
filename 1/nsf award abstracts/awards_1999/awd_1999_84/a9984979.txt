Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

High-Intensity Laser Irradiation of Microstructures 

A series of
              experimental and analytical techniques will be used to determine the thermal
              and mechanical responses of microstructures exposed to laser irradiation. 
              Arrays of microcantilevers will be fabricated using surface micromachining
              techniques and irradiated by lasers with varying pulse widths and wavelengths. 
              The deflections of a microcantilever will be monitored as a function of time. 
              Temperature and thermal expansion measurements will also be conducted.  The
              experimental results will be compared to predicted temperatures and
              deflections.  Also, an educational plan will be implemented to increase the
              number of women in engineering and to develop interdisciplinary microscale
              phenomena courses.  

An understanding of the behavior of microstructures
              exposed to radiation is required for applications like room temperature
              infrared sensing, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) for satellites and
              space vehicles, and laser processing.  This research project examines the
              interaction of laser radiation with microstructures concentrating on a novel
              laser process for repairing microcantilevers adhered to the substrate.
