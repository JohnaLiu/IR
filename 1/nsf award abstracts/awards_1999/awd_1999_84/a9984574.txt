Visualizing 3-dimensional complexity of
              tropical rainforest canopies

The project will develop a suite of
              3-dimensional models (building block-like structures) based on percolation and
              fractal theory.  This approach will help the researchers understand how simple
              3-dimensional structures relate to measures of pattern that will be used to
              quantify the complex organization of simulated and remotely-sensed tropical
              rainforests.  In addition to these analyses, a virtual reality tropical
              rainforest canopy exhibit for the Orlando Science Center will be created.  This
              exhibit will allow students and other visitors to immerse themselves in a
              tropical rainforest that undergoes successional processes, like gap dynamics,
              in just minutes for processes that typically require hundreds of years.
