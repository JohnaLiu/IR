Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of ring-opening metathesis
              polymerization (ROMP) strategies to structurally diverse polymeric motifs that
              contain sulfur- and phosphorus-based functional groups.  Emphasis will be
              placed on the design and synthesis of asymmetric monomeric units containing
              norbornene skeletons.  Sulfonamide-based oligopeptides, sulfamide scaffolds
              containing C2-symmetric pockets, polymeric nucleic acid scaffolds and polymeric
              lipid scaffolds will be prepared using the ROMP methodology.  These diverse
              polymers can potentially serve as novel pharmaceutical agents, ligands in
              asymmetric catalysis, artificial lipid scaffolds and DNA/RNA antisense agents. 
              The educational portion of the project stresses graduate student mentoring of 
              undergraduates, a vigorous undergraduate tutoring program, multi-media
              pre-laboratory preparation and lecture presentation, and high school
              outreach.

With this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. Paul R.
              Hanson of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Kansas.  Professor
              Hanson will focus his research on the development of pharmaceutically relevant
              sulfur- and phosphorus-based oligomers. The foci of the educational activities
              involve mentoring, tutoring and undergraduate course development.
