Abstract    :
              Professor Christoph Rose-Petruck of Brown University is funded through a CAREER
              grant in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program.  He will utilize newly
              acquired ultrafast X-ray pulses to study the molecular motions accompanying the
              photolysis of metal carbonyls in solution.  The advantage here is that using
              X-ray absorption spectroscopy, direct structural determinations can be made for
              the first time on ultra-short lived molecular species.  Professor Rose-Petruck
              will produce a "Virtual Laboratory Manual" which enables students to practice
              with simulated instruments and deal with sample raw data before performing the
              real experiment in the laboratory.  At a more advanced level, students will
              then work with Rose-Petruck's  "Virtual Research Project" and in group work,
              learn from a simulated research project.

The structures of chemical species
              undergoing reactions have to date only been surmised using light-based
              techniques that rely heavily on theory for interpretation.  With ultrafast
              x-ray pulses, scientists will have a greater chance of getting "snapshots" of
              very short lived species in a direct manner.  Understanding structural changes
              in a chemical reaction will lead to the design of more efficient synthetic
              pathways.  
The educational plan here utilizes the World Wide Web in an
              interactive fashion to improve learning in the laboratory.
