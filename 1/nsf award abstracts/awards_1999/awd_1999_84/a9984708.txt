              ABSTRACT:
Green/9984708
This CAREER award provides funding to investigate the
              relationship between the seasonal patterns of calcium carbonate diagenesis and
              the time-dependent changes of benthic foraminifera and meiofaunal-sized
              bivalves in the nearshore deposits of Casco Bay, Maine. This work will
              contribute to our understanding of the marine cycling of CaCO3 and atmospheric
              CO2. In the educational portion of this proposal, the PI requests funding to
              develop and implement educational programs that integrate "hands-on" and
              "minds-on" research opportunities into undergraduate students' experiences at a
              small liberal arts college.  The program will be designed to encourage female
              undergraduates to pursue careers in science.
