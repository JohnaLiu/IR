Abstract    :
              This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and organometallic Chemistry
              program supports research on the development of a new combinatorial method that
              will be used to rapidly screen metal ions and complexes for peptide cleavage,
              by Professor Kathryn Grant of the Department of Chemistry at the Georgia State
              University. This methodology involves the use of resin beads for immobilization
              of peptides followed by cleavage in the presence of various metal ions. The
              success of a particular metal ion-amino acid (mono-tripeptide) combination will
              be monitored by means of fluoresence. In addition to identifying active metals,
              the method will also reveal the degree of sequence specific cleavage and
              indicate the actual amino acid sequence motifs that are cleaved.

The goal of
              this research is to develop a method to quickly examine and identify metal
              compounds which can cleave peptides at selected sites. Such reagents have
              become increasingly important to the fields of chemistry and biology for
              protein structural analysis, and there is a great need for new ones which can
              operate under mild conditions. The results of this study will contribute to the
              design of second generation metal complexes with enhanced cleavage
              efficiencies. A new inorganic chemistry course on the roles of metal ions in
              biological systems will be introduced and students will participate in an
              ongoing statewide science TV series. An innovative student summer internship
              program working through a placement agency will be organized, and will allow
              undergraduates to gain valuable industrial experience.
