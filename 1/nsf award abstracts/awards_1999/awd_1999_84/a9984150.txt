Abstract    :
              This CAREER research program conducted by Dr. Julie Stenken of Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute is supported by the Analytical and Surface Program in the
              Chemistry Division.  The focus of this research is to develop microdialysis
              probes for in vitro macrophage cell cultures with the goal of monitoring
              real-time chemical concentrations.  The chemicals to be monitored include
              hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide and prostaglandins.  She will evaluate the
              biocompatibility of a variety of sensor membrane materials.  She also will
              expand her previous work on a cyclodextrin complexation method for
              concentrating trace chemicals in the cell culture with sampling by
              microdialysis.  The educational component of her research includes the
              incorporation of this research into her graduate program.  Dr. Stenken also
              plans to develop an outreach educational program for  local high schools,
              directed specifically to underrepresented women and minority students.

The
              impact of this research on the biomedical engineering community is expected to
              be high.  There are a number of complex issues related to the routine use of
              microdialysis sampling which Dr. Stenken will address.  Studying membrane
              materials and the inflammatory response which they cause will lead to a clearer
              fundamental understanding of the compatibility of materials with blood and
              tissues.
