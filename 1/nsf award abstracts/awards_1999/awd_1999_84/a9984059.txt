This CAREER award establishes a semiconductor research
              program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute which also incorporates a number of
              education activities.  The research objective of this grant is to carry out new
              evelopments in the fundamentals of empirical band-structure theory and
              implement them on the computer.  An example is an exact envelope-function
              theory of quantum wells and laterally composition-modulated structures.  The
              methodology will involve the study of a number of  electronic and optical
              properties of semiconductor nanostructures which are either still controversial
              or which cannot be fully explained by all currently available empirical
              band-structure models.  Examples include birefringence and selection rules for
              light absorption in semiconductor quantum wells, and quantum dot and short
              period superlattice band structures.  The solutions lie in the development and
              implementation of fundamentally, as opposed to numerically, improved
              band-structure models.  A key aspect of the proposed research is to compare and
              contrast a number of different empirical techniques (tight binding, effective
              mass, empirical pseudopotential) and identify and develop extensions relevant
              to the physical properties to be explored.  Most of the studies will benefit
              from direct collaborations with various experimental groups at universities and
              national laboratories in the USA and abroad.

Integrated with this research
              is an educational plan which will serve as a model for a new approach to solid
              state physics pedagogy.  This involves applying research philosophy to both
              undergraduate and graduate classrooms, where case studies and, for
              undergraduates, peer instruction will be used.  In addition, a new
              interdisciplinary course, Quantum Engineering, will be developed with a focus
              on nanostructured devices.  One objective is to train "classical" engineers to
              think "quantum."  Finally, there will be an education outreach program for high
              school students.
