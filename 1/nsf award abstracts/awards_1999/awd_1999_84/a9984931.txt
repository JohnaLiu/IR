Abstract    :
              This CAREER research project entitled "Nanostructure and Low Energy Dynamics at
              Aqueous-Oxide Interfaces " will be carried out by Dr. Carol Hirschmugl at the
              University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee and is supported by the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Division.  The purpose of the research is to study and
              structurally characterize oxide surfaces, and in particular, how those surfaces
              interact with adsorbates such as water, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and
              halogenated hydrocarbons.  Dr. Hirschmugl will utilize the advanced
              spectroscopic and structure characterization techniques of far-IR and
              pico-ampere LEED in this research.

The educational component of this
              research includes incorporation of the instrumental techniques in both graduate
              and undergraduate education.  The proximity of the synchrotron facility to the
              University makes it possible to effectively include undergraduates.  It is
              significant that undergraduates will be exposed to these state of the art
              techniques.

This research will involve novel experiments aimed at
              fundamental studies of surface interactions.  This research will impact the
              areas of surface science, catalyst design, environmental geochemistry and
              geophysics.  The reactants chosen; water, nitric oxide, and carbon dioxide are
              of environmental importance.  Understanding their interactions with minerals
              could ultimately have an impact on society as well.
