Abstract    :
              This research program will apply analysis, nondestructive and experimental
              techniques in order to develop an understanding of impact damage in composite
              pipes under service conditions.  The first phase will consist on the
              development of a finite element model that will include the effects of internal
              pressure as indicated by the service conditions of the structure. Endurance
              prediction models, of the composite after impact, will be developed and
              verified with experimental testing.  The second phase will consist of a testing
              program with different levels of impact energy and internal pressure ratios on
              fiber reinforced composite pipes.  During the experimental phase,
              nondestructive evaluation techniques such as acoustic emission, modal analysis
              and acousto-ultrasonics, will be applied to collect information about the
              mechanisms associated with failure induced by long term loading after impact. 
              The final phase will consist on the analytical reduction of the experimental
              results for comparison with predictions from phase one and, the necessary
              adjustments to the models.
This program will contribute to the understanding
              of the mechanical behavior of fiber composite materials, the ability to
              evaluate the significance of unexpected damage, and to the knowledge necessary
              for reliable implementation of composite materials in offshore structures.
