Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is the application of computer vision
techniques, in
              particular stereo vision techniques, to the domain of
image-based rendering
              (IBR) --- the problem of synthesizing novel
views of a scene based on existing
              images.  The long-term goal is to
develop a system that builds an image-based
              scene representation from
a stream of input images, while actively selecting
              new viewpoints.
Specific topics of investigation will include: the development
              of new
performance measures for IBR methods; the development of new
              IBR
techniques based on stereo vision; the application of texture
synthesis
              techniques to occlusion issues; the utilization of visual
landmarks for
              calibration; and the development of on-line and off-line
algorithms for the
              selection of reference viewpoints.
    Undergraduate students will be involved
              significantly in all
aspects of the research project, including
              implementation,
experimentation, authoring papers, and attending conferences. 
              Other
students will benefit through the integration of current
              research
topics into the curriculum, and through use of the lab
              facilities
created in the context of the project.  The PI's long-term
              educational
goals include developing non-traditional courses aimed at students
              not
ordinarily specializing in the sciences, and establishing contacts
              to
industry for a real-world perspective.
