Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to study the biosynthesis and degradation
              pathways of paclitaxel the variability of paclitaxel accumulation over time in
              Taxus cell suspension cultures.  Two approaches outlined for this are
              increasing the biosynthesis of paclitaxel and minimizing degradation after
              production.  The specific objectives of this project are to: (1) determine if
              the condensation of the nonside-chain taxanes with phenylisoserine is rate
              limiting, (2) characterize potential enzymatic and non-enzymatic degradative
              pathways of paclitaxel, (3) increase paclitaxel stability/solubility in the
              medium, (4) characterize and monitor genetic and metabolic variability in Taxus
              suspension cultures, (5) identify and characterize distinct cell subpopulations
              inn cultures, and (6) formulate mathematical models to describe paclitaxel
              metabolism.
