The educational objectives will focus on the
              implementation of  new educational approaches that emphasize the interrelation
              of circuit and electromagnetic parameters and help develop a broader
              perspective of the High-frequency
analysis and design. These approaches will
              take advantage of the multidisciplinary use of Multiresolution Analysis and
              will emphasize to students early in their careers that engineering decisions
              and designs must take into account both the overall system performance and the 
              computational cost.

The interaction with industry will play a significant
              role in this effort through the extensive undergraduate and PhD co-op programs
              and the support of new outreach programs for encouraging research careers of
              undergraduates in High-frequency and Wireless Communication design.
