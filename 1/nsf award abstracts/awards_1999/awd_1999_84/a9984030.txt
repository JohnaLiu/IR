Abstract    :
              PI: Prashant Shenoy

The rapid growth of the Internet coupled with advances in
              computing
and communication technologies has led to the emergence of a
              variety
of distributed multimedia applications. Realizing such
              applications
requires the development of large-scale information servers that
              can
efficiently manage heterogeneity in data characteristics and
application
              requirements.  The main objective of the proposed research
is to develop
              scalable, high-performance information servers to enable
Internet-based
              multimedia applications and utilize the results of this
research to enhance
              the effectiveness of imparting education.

The proposed research will address
              three key issues: (i) the design of
a scalable, general-purpose multimedia
              file system based on
network-attached storage, (ii) the design of a
              coordinated resource
management framework for efficiently managing resources
              on large
servers, and (iii) the design of a multimedia proxy cache
              architecture
for efficiently delivering data to applications over wide
              area
networks.  The research methodology for addressing these problems
              is
eclectic, relying on a combination of analysis, simulation, and
prototype
              implementation.

The proposed teaching efforts will focus on the development
              of a
curriculum in multimedia systems and the use of multimedia technology
to
              improve the effectiveness of distance and classroom education.  The
proposed
              effort will: (i) lead to development of hands-on,
laboratory-based graduate
              and undergraduate courses in multimedia, and
(ii) explore the use of
              multimedia technology to develop more
effective pedagogical aids.
