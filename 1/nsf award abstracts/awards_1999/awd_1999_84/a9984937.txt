Abstract    :
              This project involves the integration of teaching and research activities.  The
              research aspects involve the synthesis and study of small, neutral, all-carbon
              molecules.  These play a key role in the formation of fullerenes from graphite
              vapor, but very little is known about the reactivity of these putative
              fullerene precursors.  Controlled production and isolation of the all-carbon
              compounds in the gas phase and in low-temperature matrices will provide
              detailed spectroscopic information about the structures and reactivity of both
              linear and cyclic all-carbon isomers.  The integration of research and
              educational activities involves the inclusion of current research topics in the
              undergraduate curriculum as well as the incorporation of molecular modeling
              into teaching and research.

With this CAREER Award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Program provides support for the research of Professor Nancy S.
              Goroff of the State University of New York at Stony Brook.  Professor Goroff
              will study the behavior of novel small molecules that are theorized to be
              precursors to buckminsterfullerenes and related compounds, and will seek to
              integrate these research activities with her teaching responsibilities. 
              Current research topics will be brought into the classroom to enliven the
              curriculum and provide students with a better appreciation for modern
              chemistry.  In addition, a workshop series in molecular modeling is seen as an
              opportunity for the advancement of teaching for science majors, since it is a
              critical part of modern chemical research.
