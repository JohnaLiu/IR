Abstract    :
                  The OH radical is one of the most important species in tropospheric
              chemistry and global climate change. In addition to controlling the lifetimes
              of many important atmospheric species, OH initiates the oxidation of carbon
              monoxide and hydrocarbons, which in the presence of nitrogen oxides can lead to
              the production of ozone in urban, rural and remote environments. The overall
              goal of this career development plan is to contribute new insights into the
              rapid and complex chemistry of the troposphere through laboratory experiments
              and ambient air measurements of OH and HO2, and integrate this research area
              into the classroom through a hands-on, project-based laboratory curriculum for
              undergraduate and graduate courses in atmospheric chemistry and environmental
              science. The plan involves the construction of a new laser-induced fluorescence
              instrument capable of making reliable measurements of OH and HO2 with high
              sensitivity.  The instrument will be utilized in the laboratory to study the
              chemical kinetics of non-methane hydrocarbon oxidation, in smog chamber
              experiments to measure OH and HO2 under a variety of controlled conditions, and
              in ambient air as part of research field campaigns.  The educational component
              of this CAREER project will allow students to obtain and analyze measurements
              of OH and HO2  in conjunction with measurements of O3, CO, and NOx.
