Abstract    :
              This CAREER award to Professor Brian Cooper of the University of North Carolina
              at Charlotte is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in
              the Chemistry Division. The primary research objective is to separate 
              fluorescently labeled proteins using microbore liquid chromatography and to use
              a novel form of single molecule channel electroproresis to detect the separated
              proteins. This online detection technique will provide high throughput,
              excellent sensitivity and when coupled with size exclusion chromatography
              provides a second potentially othogonal dimension to the separation.  The
              educational aspect of the effort consists of a series of hands on workshops in
              the use of bioanalytical instrumentation. These interdisciplinary workshops
              will be aimed at undergraduate students, graduate students and their advisors
              from the University's new interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in biotechnology and
              biomedicine.   

The project supported by this program focuses on development
              of a high throughput method to separate and identify proteins.  Results from
              this work could lead to improved analysis of proteins and will be very useful
              for workers in the University of North Carolina at  Charlotte.
