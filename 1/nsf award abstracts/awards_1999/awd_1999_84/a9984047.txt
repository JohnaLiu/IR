CAREER: Information Sources for Software Maintenance

This project
              consists of a series of empirical studies to understand how software
              maintainers gain information about the systems being maintained, with the goal
              of improving the quality and productivity of maintenance processes in general. 
              It begins with an exploratory investigation of what factors need to be
              considered, including appropriate measures of effectiveness, an operational
              definition of information source, and identification of other relevant
              variables.  Then current maintenance practices are studied to determine what
              sources are efficient, effective, and available in different situations. 
              Finally, based on the results of the exploratory work, improvements to
              maintenance practice are proposed and empirically validated. The study designs
              incorporate a wide variety of research methods in order to triangulate findings
              and trade off different threats to validity.  Industrial participation is
              crucial, not only to obtain valid and useful results, but also to ensure that
              the significant long-term potential of this work is realized.  This work also
              includes an educational component consisting of two major activities:
              development of a software engineering course concentrating on the latter stages
              of the lifecycle (emphasizing maintenance), and extensive involvement of
              graduate and undergraduate students in software engineering research.
