Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to conduct research in experimental high energy physics,
              which seeks to elucidate the fundamental interactions of matter.  Its ultimate
              goal is to describe all the fundamental interactions by a single unified
              theory.  However, at this time we can describe only the electromagnetic and
              weak interactions with a fundamental theory, which when coupled with a
              heuristic theory of the strong interactions called Quantum Chromodynamics,
              constitute the so-called Standard Model of Quarks and Leptons.  The properties
              of the recently discovered top quark - especially its large mass - are
              parameters that such theories have to explain.
	The Tevatron at Fermilab is
              the only accelerator currently running with enough energy to produce top quarks
              in the laboratory.  This proposal is to use the data from the upcoming Tevatron
              Run II to perform a precision measurement of the top quark mass.  The precision
              of this measurement is now limited by the systematic uncertainty in the jet
              energy scale calibration.  To reduce this uncertainty, the work proposed is to
              use the decay Z  b b-bar to calibrate the jet energy scale.  This involves
              development of reconstruction algorithms to identify b-quark jets and the
              design and construction of a silicon track trigger processor that will allow
              triggering on events with b quarks.
