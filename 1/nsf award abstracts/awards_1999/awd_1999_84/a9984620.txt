Abstract    :
              This project will develop a first principle method for describing the effects of
              complex geometry and morphology on the adhesion of micron-scale colloids to
              substrates. This is of importance in the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing
              industry.  Traditional approaches to describing particle adhesion rely on
              Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory or on approaches using the work
              of adhesion in conjunction with the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT),
              Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR), or Maugis-Dugdale (MD) models for colloid
              deformation.  These approaches are only applicable for idealized
              systems.

The proposed approach will modify traditional van der Waals (vdW)
              force expressions to describe the adhesion in aqueous solution. It will account
              for complex geometry and morphology of the substrates and colloids and also
              will include the deformation and roughness of the colloids and substrates.
              Descriptions of geometrically and morphologically-complex colloid-substrate
              systems of interest to the semiconductor community will be included. 
              Measurement of the contact adhesion force will be performed with an atomic
              force microscope (AFM).  The colloids are either good model materials or common
              contaminants in integrated circuit processing (SiO 2 , and Al 2 O 3 ). The
              substrates are important substrates for integrated circuit processing.

In
              the semiconductor industry, the proposed approach could find immediate
              application in wafer cleaning protocols during post-etch processing and
              post-chemical-mechanical-polishing processing. In the biomedical industry, it
              could be used to improve implant sterilization processes.
