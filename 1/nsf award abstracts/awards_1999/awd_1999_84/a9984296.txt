Abstract    :
              The heterogeneous, autonomous, and highly dynamic nature of databases on the Web
              renders most traditional data management techniques ineffective. Consequently,
              keeping abreast of relevant information as it evolves in this environment
              requires a large amount of human effort. The goal of this research is to
              develop, implement, and evaluate methods for data management in a
              heterogeneous, autonomous, and dynamic environment. The history of changes made
              to data is the major focus of this project. Methods for efficiently
              discovering, storing, browsing, and querying changes are developed. In sharp
              contrast to traditional database techniques, these methods try to make the best
              possible use of the structure in data without requiring data to conform to a
              fixed structure or schema. The educational component includes redesigning the
              current database curriculum; development of new courses on XML, related Web
              technologies, and semistructured data; and experimenting with pedagogical tools
              such as teaching by program dissection (the use of the source code of a large
              program as an anchor for studying related topics). In addition to graduate
              students, undergraduate students are involved in research by working on the
              system prototype, which in turn benefits from their efforts. In summary, this
              research will bring the benefits of database technology (e.g., faster, easier,
              and more precise information access) to the Web by developing methods that cope
              with the heterogeneous, autonomous, and dynamic nature of Web databases.
