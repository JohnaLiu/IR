Abstract    :
              Staggs will build a new instrument to measure the as yet undetected polarization
              of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In the standard paradigm of
              cosmology, theory
predicts that the CMB will be polarized at the level of a
              few parts in 106, with an angular spectrum parameterized by ten cosmological
              parameters, including the cosmological constant, the baryon density, Hubble's
              constant, and the density of the cold dark matter.  Staggs' experiment will not
              only detect the polarization, but begin tracing out its angular spectrum.  The
              CMB polarization is one of the exciting 	frontiers of modern cosmology that
              Staggs will introduce to students in a new class called Cosmology As It
              Happens. Other topics will include whatever breaking stories about cosmology
              are in the public eye at the time.  Cosmology As It Happens is meant for
              nonspecialists, and will implement the learn by teaching method of instruction.
              Students will be placed into small, heterogeneous groups and asked to design
              web sites for grade-school kids. Local Trenton area fifth graders will be
              invited into the university to test and critique the websites.
