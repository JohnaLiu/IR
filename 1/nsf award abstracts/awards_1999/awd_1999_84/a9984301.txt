Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to perform fundamental structure-property research
              that will be useful in the rational design of catalytic structures anticipated
              to have maximum yield and selectivity for reactions of interest.  Catalytic
              activity, adsorption characteristics, and intrinsic material properties of a
              variety of local zeolite structures will be studied.  In particular reactions
              involving hydrocarbons will be investigated to determine which structures are
              most active for a particular reaction.  A major result will be a formulation
              that relates the most important properties of solid acid zeolites to the
              corresponding catalytic activity of the zeolite.  The basic methodologies to be
              employed are density functional theory, Car-Parinello molecular dynamics, and
              recently developed statistical mechanical techniques.  The latter two combined
              will allow the simulation of catalytically activated chemical processes of any
              time scale at any temperature.  Through collaborations at MIT and other
              organizations, an experimental program to validate the results of the
              simulations will be carried out.  Educational initiatives include the
              development of a research program in molecular computational methodology for
              undergraduates and a new course for seniors that will focus on quantum
              mechanical methods.  This work will have application to essential chemical
              processes such as hydrocarbon synthesis, dehydration, cracking, and
              isomerization.
