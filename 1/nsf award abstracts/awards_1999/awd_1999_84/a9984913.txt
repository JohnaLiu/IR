The goal of this research is to use the dimeric protein
              Fis (factor for inversion stimulation) as a model system to investigate the
              significance of kinetic intermediates in protein folding and oligomerization.
              Two main objectives are (1) to modulate the folding pathway of Fis to control
              the population of kinetic intermediate(s), and (2) to determine how the
              presence or absence of intermediates affects the stability of Fis and its
              folding kinetics. The effect of specific residue changes on the structure and
              stability of peptides corresponding to the three Fis sub-domains will be
              studied. These changes will then be incorporated into the full-length protein,
              one domain at a time or in combination to alter the presence of folding
              intermediates. Fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies in
              conjunction with rapid mixing (stopped-flow) methods will be used to monitor
              the secondary and tertiary structure, respectively, of Fis and Fis peptides.
              

Despite much research, the mechanism by which the amino acid sequence of a
              protein determines its 3D structure, which is essential for function, is still
              poorly understood. Deciphering the "folding code" contained in the amino acid
              sequence could result in many significant applications in biotechnology,
              including the prediction of a protein's three dimensional structure and the
              rational design of proteins with a desired fold and function. This project will
              use optical spectroscopy to investigate whether protein intermediate
              conformational states that are often observed in protein folding studies are
              required for correct and efficient folding. The educational component of this
              project involves the training and mentoring of undergraduate and high school
              students with emphasis on underrepresented minorities. It is anticipated that
              through research opportunities, these students will obtain the training,
              experience, and knowledge to consider science as a career choice.
