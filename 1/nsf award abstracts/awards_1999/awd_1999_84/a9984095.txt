Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop a flocculation process for virus
              clearance in biopharmaceutical production.  The specific objectives of this
              project are: (1) flocculation of cells, (2) flocculation of viruses in the
              absence of cells, (3) flocculation of cell-virus suspensions, (4) optimization
              of bioreactor harvesting, and (5) prediction of virus clearance.
