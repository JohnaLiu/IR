Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to investigate the boundary tension and surface
              viscosity of Langmuir films at the air/water interface, and to determine how to
              control the structure and dynamic response of Langmuir monolayers. When
              molecules align at a surface, symmetry is broken leading to long -range
              electrostatic repulsion between surface molecules. Movement within the
              monolayer is coupled to the substrate. The combination of hydrodynamics and
              electrostatics leads to long lived metastable states within the film. The
              formation of these states, and the relaxation from them, determines the
              structure and dynamics of biomembranes and are crucial in making
              Langmuir-Blodgett films. This project will focus on the rheology of isolated
              islands of dense, phase-separated polymers as monolayer films. The boundary
              tension will be determined as a function of various parameters such as
              temperature and molecular weight, and the results compared with theoretical and
              numerical results. With copolymers, the influence of liquid crystal side chains
              in increasing fractions on the boundary energy and structure will be explored.
              A major educational goal is to attract and train a diverse group of students at
              every educational  level, and to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations in
              addressing the fundamental science of technologically important
              questions.
%%%
Langmuir films consisting of molecules self-confined at a
              fluid surface serve as model quasi-two dimensional systems of technologically
              and biologically important systems such as foams, emulsions, Langmuir-Blodgett
              multilayers, and biological membranes.  Langmuir-Blodgett films, when
              sufficiently controlled, are used as liquid crystal alignment layers,  as films
              for non-linear optics, and for modeling bio-membranes.
