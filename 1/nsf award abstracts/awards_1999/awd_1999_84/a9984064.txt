Abstract    :
              9984064  Burken  Phytoremediation is a natural systems-based engineering
              application that has the potential of removing or destroying organic
              contaminants in the environment.  The uptake, translocation and volatilization
              of organic contaminants are not well understood and these issues currently
              serve as a point of uncertainty, limiting regulatory acceptance.  The
              objectives of the research component of this project are: (1) to elucidate
              contaminant translocation and potential volatilization pathways in
              field-representative conditions that include plants with vascular root systems
              in the vadose and saturated zones, (2) to ascertain the impact and
              survivability of genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) in the poplar
              rhizosphere, and potentially advance a new application of phytoremediation, and
              (3) to continue development of a screening procedure for organic contaminant
              phytoremediation.  Phytoremediation/GEMs combinations will be developed and
              evaluated in conditions and with methods that mimic full-scale practices. 
              
The objectives of the education component of this project are: (1) to arouse
              students' interest in environmental engineering and enhance their professional
              development through undergraduate research, teaching, student activities and
              field observations of current civil and environmental engineerign applications
              and practices, (2) to improve and enrich the environmental engineering program
              at UMR by revising the existing curriculum and teaching methods and by
              increasing numbers of non-traditional students and (3) to enhance instructional
              skills through training workshops on teaching methods and techniques.  This is
              a continuation of the PI's work in the education field that will include
              founding a national student chapter of the Association of Environmental
              Engineering and Science Professors, with associated UMR student chapter,
              integration of WebCT into curricula, participation in teaching workshops,
              implementation of a student project as a full-scale waste treatment facility
              and continued development of a student Stream Team.  These activities are
              expected to directly and immediately impact the science and engineering
              education of approximately 110 undergraduate and graduate students per year.
