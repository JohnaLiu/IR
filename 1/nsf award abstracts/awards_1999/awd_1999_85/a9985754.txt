              Foundation support for an Engineering Conference on Supercritical Fluids in
              Materials Processing and Synthesis is proposed.  The conference is scheduled
              for the period, September 26 - October 1, 1999 in Davos, Switzerland.  The
              organizer is Professor Esin Gulari of the Department of Chemical Engineering
              and Materials Science at Wayne State University.  The conference covers
              fundamental and applied aspects of polymer synthesis and processing, particle
              generation, and reactions in supercritical fluids, with the purpose of
              improving the developing environmentally conscious approaches through
              employment of supercritical solvents.  The technical program secures the
              participation of lead scientists and engineers with academic and industrial
              affiliations from the USA and Europe as invited speakers.  The collective
              expertise of the selected speakers covers basic and applied aspects of
              materials synthesis and processing with supercritical fluids.  The site and the
              schedule of the meeting are arranged to promote interactions among the
              participants.  The National Science Foundation supports of $24,650 for
              sponsoring 14 invited speakers and 15 graduate students is proposed.  The
              particular goal is to achieve a ratio of two-to-one among the new and
              established researchers participating in the conference.  The NSF support will
              be instrumental in achieving this goal.
