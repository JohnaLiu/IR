Abstract    :
              9985653  Sui  The goal of this project is to develop a new conceptual and
              analytical framework to systematically examine the environmental impacts of the
              emerging digital economy.  Key questions to be addressed are: What are the
              environmental consequences, measured in terms of energy/material consumption
              and waste production, of using the Internet (1) to deliver information-based
              products and services? and (2) to facilitate the retailing of tangible goods
              and products?   By extending previous work in industrial ecology, this project
              will develop an informational ecology approach as the guiding analytic
              framework to incorporate both production and consumption elements in the new
              economy.  The approach aims to establish links between industrial metabolism
              and information processing.  Detailed life cycle analyses of electronic
              commerce will be conducted at the company level for selected Internet-based
              businesses. This research will advance our knowledge of the environmental
              consequences and trade-offs of the digital economy.  It will provide insights
              into how the Internet and telecommunications technologies can be used to
              conduct business to minimize material and energy consumption with the goal of
              avoiding environmental harm. This grant is made pursuant to the NSF/EPA
              Partnership solicitation Technologies for a Sustainable Environment.***
