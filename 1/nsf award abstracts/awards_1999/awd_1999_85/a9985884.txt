This research seeks to independently validate
              age determinations of Arctic fish.  It is believed that Arctic marine fish may
              be older than the dates typically assigned from annual growth rings in their
              otoliths (ear-bones).  If fish ages are underestimated in population models,
              the models will overestimate the ability for the regional fisheries to recover
              from existing or planned catch limits.  This may be one reason for drastic
              population declines in other fisheries which were associated with over-fishing.
               To evaluate the accuracy of age assessments based on otolith ring counts,
              otoliths from a variety of Arctic fish species will be tested for otolith age
              and measuring the carbon-14 (C14) content of the otolith rings.  Because
              otolith C-14 content closely matches the C14content in surface waters, and
              because the surface water content of C14 has changed dramatically throughout
              the last 50 years due to bomb testing, this approach provides a unique and
              relatively simple test of the accuracy of the traditional method.  A new
              approach based on measuring the fall-out derived strontium-90 (Sr90) content of
              otoliths will be attempted.  In addition, dating of fish scales will be
              investigated by these methods.
