Abstract    :
              
The indisputable existence of a racial digital divide calls into question the
              democratizing potential of new technologies.  Evidence that access alone will
              not be enough to eliminate the divide suggests a consideration of fundamental
              psychological factors that influence all behavior.  The proposed research is a
              first step in testing a model of computer/Internet use.  Its purpose is to
              develop methods and measures to examine how motivational, affective and
              cognitive factors influence the computer/Internet use of African Americans, and
              how use, in turn, influences motivation, affect and cognition.  African
              American participants will receive home computers, participate in Internet
              interventions during home visits and complete survey instruments needed to test
              a model of computer/Internet use.  Results are expected to be important to
              understanding why people choose to use or not use computers/Internet and the
              impact of use on people.  Results will also be important to developing
              strategies for reducing the racial digital divide.
