This
              project addresses the problem of CO poisoning of fuel-cell electrodes.  To
              enable successful use of fuel cells in vehicular applications, the fuel gas CO
              content must be reduced below 10 ppm.  Novel alumina supported platinum
              catalysts will be used to selectively oxidize CO with oxygen. The goal is to
              reduce the level of CO to 2 ppm using 1% oxygen in the presence of large
              amounts of hydrogen.  Catalysts will be prepared by the sol-gel method in which
              colloidal platinum nanocrystallites are incorporated into an alumina gel as the
              gel is forming.  In addition, as second method of synthesis will permit
              pre-synthesized colloidal platinum crystallites to be incorporated into the
              alumina gel.  To understand the interaction between crystallite size, metal
              loading, and the components of the fuel gas, a Monte Carlo model will be
              developed. By assigning sticking coefficients and reaction rates based on
              surface science results, the PIs will develop a model that predicts the
              experimentally observed phenomena.  The model will also be used to guide
              catalyst design.  This work could lead to improvements in fuel cells for
              reducing emissions in vehicles.
