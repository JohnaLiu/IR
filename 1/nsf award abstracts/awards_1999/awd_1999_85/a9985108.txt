Abstract    :
                  The overall goal of this CAREER project is to establish an integrated
              program of research and education in which improved atmospheric aerosol models
              will be developed and incorporated into engineering classes.  The research
              component of this project is an investigation of the gas/aerosol partitioning
              behavior of secondary organic aerosols, with a focus on temperature effects. 
              Theoretical predictions and available experimental data will be used to define
              appropriate temperature-dependent aerosol partitioning parameters for
              aerosol-producing hydrocarbons in regional air quality models.  Predictions
              using constant yield aerosol production, absorptive partitioning, and
              temperature dependent absorption partitioning will be compared to determine the
              effect of temperature on ambient organic aerosol concentrations.  The approach
              developed in this study will be used in conjunction with EPA's Models3/CMAQ air
              quality modeling system to simulate field conditions encountered in the
              Southeastern United States during the 1999 Southern Oxidant Study.
