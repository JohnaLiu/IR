Abstract    :
              Dr. Karl O. Christe, Chemistry Department, University of Southern  California,
              is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program of the Chemistry Division for studies of covalent fluoride,
              oxyfluoride, and non-metal main group compounds with high coordination and
              oxidation numbers. The project will target the preparation of new homoleptic
              polynitrogen compounds, the synthesis of novel dinitramides, structural studies
              on systems including xenon-oxygen-xenon bridged compounds, hypervalent
              compounds, and examples where theory and experiment are in apparent
              contradiction. Theoretical ab initio calculations will be done along with the  
              experimental work to analyze bonding relationships.
 
This project joins
              theory with exceedingly difficult experimental work and physical
              characterization and aims at a fundamental understanding of   high-energy
              molecules. It has potential significance to the production and understanding of
              high energy density materials for propulsion and energy storage.
