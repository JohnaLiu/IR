Abstract    :
              This CAREER project has a scientific component that is based on the utilization
              of a high-intensity femtosecond laser system to investigate several important
              aspects of laser high-order harmonic generation:  1) the behavior of intrinsic
              atomic phases will be examined by use of a finely-spaced standing intensity
              modulation in the laser focus; 2) counter-propagating light will be used to
              introduce quasi phase matching for increased harmonic production efficiency;
              and 3) the quasi phase matching scheme will be utilized to examine various
              aspects of high harmonic generation.  The educational component of the project
              consists of the development of a student laboratory and curriculum for advanced
              optics that combines laboratory and analytical experience with animations that
              illustrate advanced optical concepts.
