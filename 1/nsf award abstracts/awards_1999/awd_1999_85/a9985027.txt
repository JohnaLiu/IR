Abstract    :
              This CAREER award supports a project that will develop a new laser cooling
              scheme for  atomic calcium and apply this scheme to two emerging research
              topics.  The new scheme enables polarization gradient cooling to 1 microKelvin
              and should allow temperatures 1000 times lower than that currently realized in
              laser cooled calcium.   In collaboration with researchers at NIST-Boulder, the
              ultracold calcium atoms will be used in an improved optical clock frequency
              measurement.   The atoms will also be used in experiments in dense Rydberg
              gases and ultracold, strongly coupled, two-component plasmas.  The educational
              component of the activity, in addition to heavy involvement of undergraduate
              students in the research, will recruit local area secondary school physics
              teachers as summer research associates and involve them as direct participants
              in the research projects.
