The PI
              has proposed to utilize an innovative fluid dynamics process involving the
              unsteady interaction between a primary and a secondary stream, to accomplish
              the required gas phase compression in a novel refrigeration scheme.  This
              proposal is responsive to the Technology for a Sustainable Environment
              objective in that it will accomplish the refrigeration objectives without the
              use of large molecular weight materials.  Such materials, of course, have a
              deleterious effect if released into the environment.  The investigation will
              also build upon current understandings and it will certainly open avenues for
              fundamental fluid mechanics issues related to the interaction of the primary
              and the secondary streams.
