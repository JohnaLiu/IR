              Research Strategies Workshop

The project organizes and runs a Workshop on
              Software Research Strategies in Los Angeles, CA on August 24-25, 1999 and then
              present the outcomes of the deliberations at an open forum at NSF on September
              27, 1999.  The workshop particularly focuses on the role and impact of software
              engineering in research and software practice and contributes to defining
              appropriate research agendas consistent with the recent Presidential
              Information Technology Advisory Committee Report.  About 25 leading software
              engineering researchers from academia and industry form the workshop and
              address issues such as realistic expectations for software engineering practice
              with and without significant further software engineering research.
