The Department of Computer Science at the University of
              Texas will purchase a cluster of high performance, multigranular workstations,
              dedicated to support research in computer and information science and
              engineering.  The equipment will initially be used to support four research
              projects in the department.  

The first project will use the cluster for
              detailed evaluations of future high-performance microprocessor designs.  The
              second project will use the cluster to improve algorithms for reconstructing
              large evolutionary trees, with applications in evolutionary biology,
              pharmaceutical design, and linguistics.  The third project will use the cluster
              to improve I/O -intensive data mining simulations using numerical techniques. 
              The fourth project will develop software support for scientific cluster-based
              computing, including support for effective heterogeneous job scheduling,
              low-overhead application fault-tolerance, and run-time dynamic load balancing. 
              

The cluster will consist of heterogeneous machines, with varied quantities
              of memory, disk, and processors per machine.  We will support several types of
              jobs submitted through a common interface: uniprocessor jobs, shared-memory
              parallel jobs, PVM message-passing jobs, and distributed-shared memory jobs. 
              Our long-term goal is to build a centralized but scalable resource that can
              meet the needs of numerous scientific workloads concurrently.
