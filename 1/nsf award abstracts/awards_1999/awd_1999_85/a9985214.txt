Abstract    :
              This project involves a range of educational activities that will continue to
              build a solid foundation for further contributions to teaching and research. 
              The specific focus of the research component is to develop a novel method to
              improve binding of small organic molecules to their target proteins.  Synthetic
              chemistry is used to construct bifunctional molecules which are capable of
              binding to two different proteins, whereupon additional stabilizing
              interactions may be acquired.  Mechanistic studies are proposed to directly
              examine the trimeric complexes in solution, including high-resolution mass
              spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.

With this CAREER Award the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Dynamics Program supports the
              integrated research and educational activities of Professor Thomas J. Wandless
              of Stanford University.  The proposed research will be used to take an
              observation from Nature (binding of small molecules with proteins to form
              bioactive complexes) to its recapitulation in the laboratory.  This will
              provide biological and medicinal chemists with another tool in the ongoing
              search for biologically active and useful molecules.  Activities are planned
              that contribute to curriculum development and improved student mentoring,
              including an outreach program for beginning organic chemistry students to
              promote improved mentoring and self-directed learning through research.
