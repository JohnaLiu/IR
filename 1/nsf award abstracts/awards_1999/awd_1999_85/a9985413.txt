Abstract    :
              The planetary boundary layer (PBL) is the lowest layer of the atmosphere - the
              layer in immediate contact with the earth's surface - through which heat,
              momentum, moisture, gaseous species, and aerosol particles are transported
              between the free atmosphere and the surface.  It is no surprise that processes
              in the PBL have a bearing not only on local phenomena such as air pollution,
              wind, and precipitation, but also on the climate itself through interactions
              with larger scale processes.  The research component of this CAREER award
              focuses on two questions: (1) How does the PBL interact with the large-scale,
              thermally driven, tropical atmospheric circulation?  (2) How does precipitation
              from clouds that form in the PBL modify the dynamics of this interaction?  The
              approach to each question is through numerical modeling.  For the first, a
              General Circulation Model (GCM) is modified to represent more accurately the
              physical processes in the PBL.  For the second, large eddy simulations (LES)
              are employed to determine how the vertical structure of the PBL is affected by
              precipitation.  The educational component of the work consists of developing an
              upper-level undergraduate course on the interaction of large scale atmospheric
              flow with the PBL and establishing a climate simulation laboratory.  The
              results of the effort will be improved climate simulation and better
              opportunities for students to be trained in the numerical modeling of climate.
