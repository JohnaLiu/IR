Abstract    :
              This is a time-critical small grant for exploratory research for short-term
              support of a small unique collection of Hawaiian fruit flies (Drosophila and
              Scaptomyza) that are maintained currently at the University of Hawaii, Monoa. 
              Support for the project for which these were collected is ending.  Although the
              Drosophila Species Collection has expressed interest in adding these species,
              the large collection is in the process of being moved and cannot accept the
              additions at this time.  This small award will provide short-term support to
              maintain the flies until they potentially can be moved into the living stock
              collection in its new home.
