Soil with highly non-linear water retention or conductivity
              functions may exhibit both rapid and slow soil-water advection processes.  I
              hypothesize that a near-zero threshold pressure head separates a non-linear
              unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function into regions where  constant and
              where  hydraulic conductivity and  soil-water content pressure head).  I
              propose that high intensity bursts of rainfall upon a soil at or near the
              threshold pressure head will produce a subtle but rapidly advancing pressure
              wave through the soil profile.  The pressure wave will cause a large increase
              in K, the release of stored soil-water, and the rapid development of high pore
              pressures.  Such a "pressure wave-release mechanism" may lead to water
              potential conditions favoring flow into non-capillary sized pores (macropores).
               Hence, the "pressure wave-release hypothesis" may describe conditions that
              dictate when soil macropores "switch on".  The combined effects of water
              transported by pressure wave-release and  the initiation of macropore flow may
              lead to the rapid development of high pore pressures and slope instability.  I
              will conduct theoretical, laboratory and field experiments to investigate the
              pressure wave-release hypothesis and its effect on rates of water advection and
              pore pressure development.

The educational initiatives herein directly link
              experimentation with observation, and they create a unique opportunity for
              students to acquire "hand on" hydrology experience in a field laboratory. Easy
              to use instrumentation and analyses will facilitate undergraduate research on
              1) rainfall-runoff processes and 2) subsurface path length effects on buffering
              capacity of an urbanized riparian corridor.  Approximately 20 faculty expressed
              their support for the proposed research-education facility; consequently, the
              field hydrology laboratory can become an integral part of thousands of
              students' education each year.
