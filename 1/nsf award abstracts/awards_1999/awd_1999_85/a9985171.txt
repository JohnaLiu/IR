Abstract    :
              Efficient transmission of visual data over wireless networks is at the heart of
              many evolving communications applications, ranging from wireless offices to
              emergency management, telemedicine, and integration of services in smart
              handheld devices. These applications require unprecedented levels of end-to-end
              performance on hostile channels, e.g. wireless LAN and ad-hoc wireless
              networks, and put severe demands on the performance of compression and error
              control coding.

This research is developing advanced coding and signal
              processing algorithmsfor the transmission of images and video over wireless
              networks. Theinvestigator is studying two dominant approaches to joint
              source-channelcoding, namely, with algebraic codes and with
              multiple-description codes,in order to capture the efficiency of the former and
              the robustness of thelatter with an integrated approach. Concurrent work in
              receiver-sidesignal processing is producing algorithms that will enhance the
              performance underexisting systems and standards.
