Abstract    :
              This research project entitled "Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry of Polymers"
              will be carried out by Dr. David Hercules of Vanderbilt University and is
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities.  The project is  a GOALI collaboration with Dr.
              James Edman of Dupont as a co-PI.  The research focuses on complex copolymer
              systems.  There are three specific goals to the research: (1) to improve the
              technique of limited chemical reaction.  The goal of limited chemical reaction
              is to partially break the polymer chain by chemically degrading the polymer in
              a controlled fashion.   The products obtained will be used for structural
              characterization of the polymer. (2) This research will study the surface
              segregation which occurs in block co-polymers using secondary ion mass
              spectrometry (SIMS).  (3) The research will utilize limited chemical reaction
              and the mass spectrometric techniques of matrix assisted laser desorption
              ionization (MALDI), SIMS and electrospray for the characterization of polyimide
              polymers which are an insoluble and complex polymer system.

This work is of
              fundamental importance both to analytical and polymer chemistry.  The polyimide
              class selected is a particularly difficult polymer system because it is both
              complex and insoluble.  The scope of the project is large and  there is
              considerable risk associated with the work. The success of this research will
              provide a template for the analysis of broader classes of polymers.  It will
              provide important information on branching and structure of polymers.
