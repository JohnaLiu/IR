Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, continues studies of the surface electrochemistry of fuel cell
              electrodes.  Professor Wieckowski and his coworkers at the University of
              Illinois are carrying out studies of the structure and reactivity of islands on
              platinum single crystal electrodes formed by the deposition of ruthenium and
              osmium co-adsorbates.  Ternary island structures are under investigation as
              well.  Scanning probe microscopy coupled with electrochemical methods and
              ultra-high vacuum sample preparation and characterization is used to
              investigate the electrooxidation of methanol on these electrode surfaces. 
              Island edge effects, and the effect of sulfur coadsorption on the dynamics of
              this important fuel cell reaction is studied.  The results of these studies are
              useful in the design of electrocatalysts and electrodes for fuel cell
              applications. 

The structure of binary and ternary metallic islands on
              platinum electrodes used in fuel cell applications is the subject of this
              research project supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. 
              Professor Wieckowski and coworkers at the University of Illinois are using
              scanning probe microscopy and electrochemical methods to examine methanol
              electrooxidation on these model electrode surfaces.  Information from this
              research is useful in the design of improved fuel cell electrodes.
