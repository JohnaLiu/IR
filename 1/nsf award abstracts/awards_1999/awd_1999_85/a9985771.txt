Ions are transported across membranes of living organisms
              using metabolic energy derived from ATP.  The transport proteins are enzymes
              that are imbedded in the membrane and classified as P-type ATPases.  There is
              not a complete understanding of the processes performed by these enzymes due in
              part to a lack of knowledge of their atomic structures.  During the last few
              years, a new group of P-type ATPases (P1-type) has been identified in
              prokaryotes that transport heavy metals such as Cu+1, Cu+2, Zn+2, Cd+2, and
              others into cells. These enzymes have the same mechanistic characteristics as
              other P-type ATPases, but they are smaller in size.  This characteristic makes
              them easier to isolate, purify, crystallize and obtain their atomic structure. 
              The detailed structural information obtained through crystallographic analysis
              of this sub-class of P-type ATPases will provide information on the ion
              selectivity and energy transduction mechanisms of other P-type ATPases and a
              clearer understanding of energy coupled ion transport.  This is especially
              important since this knowledge may also provide a basis for the engineering of
              microorganisms that can be used effectively in bioremediation.
