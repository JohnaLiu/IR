Abstract    :
              This Faculty Early Career Development Program award to Dr. Sarah Tolbert of the
              University of California is supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing
              Program in the Chemistry Division.  The focus of the research will be the
              synthesis of new mesoporous intermetallic Zintl phase clusters, and controlling
              their assembly, order and orientation using surfactants in solvents. The
              ultimate goal of the program will be the synthesis of complex periodic
              structures that contain rigid inorganic nanostructured framework with a wide
              range of metallic and semiconducting phases.  Potential applications of these
              materials will be in size-selective electrochemical sensors and photovoltaic
              cells.  The educational plan will be to design new experiments in Materials
              Chemistry for upper-division undergraduates with interdepartmental activities
              to explore connections between materials and their properties, and to expose
              students to a variety of materials related approaches and
              solutions.

Nanoclusters with controlled structure, pore size and functions
              will be prepared for high performance applications in catalysis,
              electrochemical sensors and electrooptic devices. The teaching part of the
              award will provide excellent training opportunities to undergraduate and
              graduate students in different aspects of Materials Chemistry, including
              synthesis, characterization, study of structure-function relationships and
              fabrication of optical devices such as light emitting diodes.
