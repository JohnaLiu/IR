              Instrumentation:  Adaptive Computing Cluster

The Department of Electrical
              and Computer Engineering at Clemson University will purchase a cluster of
              workstations with reconfigurable computing  to support research in cluster
              computing, reconfigurable computing, bioinformatics, and robotics, science and
              engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research projects
              including in particular "Adaptive Computing Cluster", Fast Sequence Searching
              on an Adaptable Computing Cluster', "Reconfigurable Hardware Support for a
              Parallel File System, and "Performance Validation of Nonlinear Controllers for
              Magnetic Bearings via Dynamic Simulation'.  Each of these projects require the
              unique combination of configurable hardware and cluster computing resources
              requested to obtain experimental results.  The use of the equipment will be
              restricted to use by the faculty and students involved in these projects.
