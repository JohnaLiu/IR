Abstract    :
              Lee Sunderlin of Northern Illinois University  is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to measure the dissociation energies of
              polyhalides and other systems involving hypervalent three-center four-electron
              bonds.  Information is only available for these types of species from condensed
              phase studies where solvent effects are involved.  For this, he will use
              threshold collision-induced dissociation in a flowing afterglow tandem mass
              spectrometer apparatus.  The specific systems that will be investigated are
              mixed linear polyhalide anions, as well as branched hypervalent halides of
              germanium, phosphorus sulfur and iodine, and isoelectronic compounds.  Other
              species, including [(CH3)2Sb]3- and POF4-, will be studied as time permits to
              determine how non-halide terminal groups effect the bonding and to provide an
              anchor for fluoride affinities that are presently available.

These studies
              will lead to a further understanding of hypervalent chemical bonding, in
              particular that involving three-centered bonds containing four electrons.  The
              studies are complimentary to those in solution, where there are extensive
              solvent effects, and will provide a wealth of data on bond strengths.  The
              information is important in fields as diverse as organic superconductors,
              iodine-starch tests, mass spectrometry and atmospheric chemistry.
