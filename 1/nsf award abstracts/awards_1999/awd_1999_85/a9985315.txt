Abstract    :
              
Support is requested through the CAREER program to merge two goals through
              collaborative curricular activities that fully engage undergraduate
              inquiry-based examinations of cell physiology and in the design and execution
              of experiments on the regulatory mechanism in striated muscle.  The proposed
              research addresses two fundamental questions: 1) through what interactions
              within the troponin complex and between the complex and actin-tropomyosin does
              the troponin switch operate and 2) to what extent and by what mechanisms does
              TnI modulate the calcium sensitivity of force development, but also
              calcium-dependent process in general.  The proposed experimentation draws not
              only on molecular, biological, and general techniques but also on thermodynamic
              and kinetic reasoning, quantitative skills and mechanical analysis.
