Abstract    :
              In all vertebrate animals sophisticated brain processes must function to
              recognize and eliminate sensory stimulation that is due to the animal's own
              movements and does not carry any useful information about the outside world. 
              We seek to understand the mechanisms by which this is accomplished by studying
              the electrosensory system in a fish in which they are extremely well developed.
               Using methods for reording the responses of individual nerve cells in the
              skate hindbrain to stimuli which we artificially associate with the fish's
              movements, we call follow the process by which the brain learns to recognize
              and eliminate the effects of these stimuli which are treated  as 'self'. 
              Further physiological studies of single nerve cells during manipulation of the
              inputs to those cells are designed to reveal the cellular mechanisms for
              learning.  Preliminary studies have demonstrated that the learning is based on
              changes in a specialized circuit in the hindbrain termed a paralled fiber
              system.  The same circuit is found in the brains of all vertebrates and so our
              experiments promise to provide insights into how this circuit functions more
              generally.
