Abstract    :
              The World-Wide Web has become a prime vehicle for disseminating information. As
              a result, the number of large Web sites with complex structure and that serve
              information derived from multiple data sources is increasing. Building a web
              site involves the tasks of selecting the data that will be displayed at the
              site, designing the site's structure, and designing the visual presentation of
              pages. In existing Web-site management tools, these three tasks are, for the
              most part, interdependent, and as a result, many maintenance tasks become
              tedious to perform. The goal of this research project is to develop tools for
              flexible construction, maintenance and management of web sites. Two specific
              problems are being studied in detail. The first is the development of policies
              for efficient run-time management of Web sites. As a part of designing such
              policies, novel methods for selecting which views over the underlying data can
              be materialized in order to speed up the performance of the site. In addition,
              methods are being developed for the automatic restructuring of web sites in
              response to user browsing patterns. The second problem under consideration is
              the development of an architecture in which several web-site management tools
              can interoperate. The goal of such an architecture is to be able to support the
              larger scope of tasks involved in the lifecycle of a web site, which
              undoubtedly will require a multitude of tools. This research program is closely
              coordinated with the development of a database curriculum at the University of
              Washington, and is carried out in collaboration with industry that is likely to
              lead to technology transfer with a broad impact.
