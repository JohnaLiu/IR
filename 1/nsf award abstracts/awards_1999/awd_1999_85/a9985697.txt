Abstract    :
              Wei Kong of Oregon State University is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to extend her studies of the
              spectroscopy of field oriented molecules to medium sized organic molecules and
              biologically relevant species using laser induced fluorescence and resonance
              enhanced multiphoton ionization.  Specifically, it is proposed to investigate
              the potental surfaces of nitrobenzene and the nitrotoluene isomers to: (1)
              identify the symmetry of the species involved in the electronic transitions;
              (2) observe the photodissociation dynamics; (3) assess the effects of methyl
              substitution and (4) investigate ortho effects such as intramolecular hydrogen
              abstraction in o-nitrotoluene.  These studies will be followed by observations
              of the excitation probabilities of nucleic acid bases and their methyl
              derivatives to determine the effects of these substitutions.

The studies
              will lead to a deeper fundamental understanding of the details of the
              interaction of organic compounds and biologically relevant species with light
              by selectively orienting the molecules with respect to the polarization of that
              light.  The work has application to biophysics and the methods can potentially
              be applied to study the mechanisms involved in inducing lesions in DNA by
              ultraviolet light and in the use of this light to activate antitumor drugs.
