Abstract    :
              Sintering is an important technological process of powder and porous material
              consolidation used in various fields of manufacturing ranging from electronic
              circuit production to large-scale tooling.  The continuum approach enables
              prediction of shape distortions and density distributions under sintering which
              are critical in modeling net-shape processing of powder materials including
              both conventional powder thermoprocessing and novel areas such as laser,
              microwave, and plasma sintering.  Thereby one of the most important problems of
              powder treatment - dimension control - can be successfully resolved.  A
              considerable amount of research activity is presently taking place in this area
              but there is a lack of effort in the following directions which will be the
              focus of the present research:  (1) modeling at different hierarchical physical
              scales taking into consideration material micro-structure characteristics in
              continuum models of sintering; (2) taking into account additional factors such
              as phase transformations; (3) prediction of sintering stability and 
              development of sintering damage criteria.

The educational part of the career
              program incorporates the development of undergraduate and graduate courses
              including the preparation of a textbook on physics and mechanics of sintering
              which will combine theoretical concepts developed in three major schools (U.S.,
              Eastern and Western European) of science of sintering.
