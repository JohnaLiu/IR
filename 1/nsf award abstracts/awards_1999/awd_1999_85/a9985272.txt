PROJECT ABSTRACT
Mutually beneficial interactions between
              species are very common and of tremendous ecological importance, but are poorly
              understood relative to other interspecific interactions.  Many plant species,
              for example, take up soil phosphorus, an essential soil mineral, through
              mutualistic interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.  However, the
              process that maintains this mutualism is poorly understood, and we are
              therefore unable to predict the response of this mutualism to anthropogenic
              disturbance.  To understand the maintenance of this mutualism, I develop a
              framework that builds on a plant's ability to influence fungal growth rates
              through preferential allocation of carbon.  This model makes specific
              predictions about the response of this mutualism to environmental perturbation.
               I then propose to test this mechanism, as well as its predictions, using a
              laboratory community of mycorrhizal fungi.  These research activities are
              integrated with a multifaceted approach to enhancing ecology education at the
              secondary, undergraduate and graduate levels.  I do this by (i) facilitating
              the development of independent research projects on the dynamics within the
              plant-mycorrhizal fungal interaction, (ii) developing a research-based upper
              level undergraduate/graduate course on the ecology and evolution of mutualisms,
              and (iii) developing a unit on ecological researc
