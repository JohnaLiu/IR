Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to extend previous efforts to desulfurize
              hydrocarbons using alkanes as a source of hydrogen, with reacts directly with
              sulfur.  The use of hydrogen for desulfurization requires expensive and
              energy-intensive steam reforming or partial oxidation of natural gas. 
              Hydrogen-rich alkanes offer alternative hydrogen sources if they can be used
              directly during their processing to remove sulfur as hydrogen sulfide.  In
              previous work the feasibility of this concept was demonstrated using reactions
              of propane-thiophene mixtures on zinc and cobalt exchanged zeolites.  The
              current work extends this chemistry to a broader range of cation-exchanged
              zeolites, to sources of hydrogen that include methane and higher hydrocarbons,
              and to more refractory sulfur and nitrogen compounds.  In addition, the
              mechanism of coupled hydrogenation-dehydrogenation requirements and the
              specific role of cation and acid sites in the chemistry will be studies with
              the aim to develop predictive structure-function rules that will guide the
              synthesis of more effective catalysts.  This technique for sulfur removal may
              form the basis for an efficient and environmentally-benign process.
