This proposed research is devoted to the development of
              streamlined and reliable computational methods for value function
              approximation.  A successful outcome would be approximation algorithms that are
              widely-accessible and effective in the control of complex systems.

Proposed
              approximation methods build on work in the area of neuro-dynamic programming
              which is sometimes called "Approximate Dynamic Programming" or "Reinforcement
              Learning."  Algorithms that will be developed are based on approximate value
              iteration, temporal-difference, learning, and linear programming.  A method for
              "feature selection" involving the use of value functions associated with
              simplified problems will also be explored.

To promote a pragmatic view of
              methods under development, and to provide a testbed for evaluation of ideas,
              two applications have been chosen to play integral roles in the project:
              dynamic risk management and the control of multiclass queuing networks.

The
              educational component of this project includes a new graduate level course on
              neurodynamic programming together with a realignment of current courses to
              incorporate a greater emphasis on computation, to foster an appreciation for
              the use of approximations when system become more complex, and to promote a
              unified view of stochastic control problems across many
              disciplines.
