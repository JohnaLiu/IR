Abstract    :
              This award to Professor David Yaron of Carnegie Mellon University is supported
              by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division and
              the Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research.  The focus
              of the research will be the applications of quantum chemistry to the molecular
              photodynamics and electronic structures of conducting polymers and other
              related materials.  A combination of computational tools and theoretical models
              such as "Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap" (INDO) Hamiltonians with
              periodic boundary conditions, dynamic dielectric screening and effective
              particle methods will be used to determine the structure-property relationships
              and photophysical properties in conjugated polymers.  Polydiacetylenes,
              poly(para-phenylene vinylene), polythiophenes and polyanilines will be studied
              in solution and as thin films. 

Theoretical models and computational tools
              will be used to study the electronic and photophysical properties of conducting
              polymers and other related materials.  The knowledge gained from these studies
              will have applications in the design, synthesis and fabrication of high
              performance and low cost conducting polymers for applications in electronic and
              photonic devices.  These custom designed polymers will be robust and will be
              suitable for environmentally stable applications.
