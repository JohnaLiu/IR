Abstract 

Type-safe language runtime
              systems are being used as mechanisms for evaluating untrusted computations
              within a wide range of applications from Web browsers and proxy servers to
              databases and agent systems.  Most current language-based systems have
              insufficient resource controls for aggregate use of memory, CPU, network
              bandwidth, and so
forth.  This research aims to implement resource management
              support within language-based systems, allowing for widespread use of a
              promising new technology.  This research will design and implement language
              runtime mechanisms within a commercial Java system to accurately and
              efficiently account for memory and CPU use, and to allow for safe termination
              of a computation.  These mechanisms will be
supported by rigorous mathematical
              models allowing their security and efficiency to be formally studied, and their
              applicability to extend to a wide class of language-based systems.  Educational
              activities at Rice University will be integrated with this research, building
              on topics across the traditional computer science curriculum.  Course
              developments will teach techniques for building secure systems, emphasizing
              both formal methods and practical software engineering techniques with an
              understanding of how hackers work in practice.  Additionally, community
              outreach will work to dispel common misconceptions about computer security
              through the popular press and various speaking engagements.
