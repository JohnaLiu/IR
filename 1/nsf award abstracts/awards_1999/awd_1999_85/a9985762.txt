Abstract    :
              The Advanced Research and Education Network Atlas (ARENA) project will create a
              web accessible compendium of information about research and education (R&E)
              networks around the world. By bringing a variety of information about the
              capacity, capabilities and connections of R&E networks together in a single
              place and in a uniform format, the ARENA will facilitate the engineering and
              use of advanced networks by the research and education community. At the core
              of the ARENA will be a repository of maps of high performance backbone networks
              in the US and around the world.
