Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to host a workshop to address the issue of power
              electronics education and new means to develop multi-media based instruction. 
              This workshop will discuss various delivery techniques available and how to
              implement them into power electronics sources.  The workshop will also focus on
              detailed course offerings, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. and
              explores the current industry needs for power electronics engineers.  This
              workshop will also address the issues of hardware laboratory  and computer
              simulation support accompanying course instructions.  Among its expected final
              recommendations is the presentation of comprehensive power electronics
              curricula for both undergraduate and graduate level courses and to include
              specific detailed course and laboratory contents.  The workshop will provide
              the opportunity to make use of the collective experiences of many experts in
              the field and to reach a consensus on global electronics curricula.
