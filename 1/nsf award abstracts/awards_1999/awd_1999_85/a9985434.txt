The turtle brain is uniquely able to endure and function under
              many hours of totally anaerobic conditions. We intend to discover the role of
              neurotransmitters in providing this anoxic tolerance. The work will focus on
              how neurotransmitters modulate the brain electrical  depression that is a key
              to anoxic survival and will investigate the role of the inhibitory
              neurotransmitter GABA in long term anoxic survival.  The turtle brain has
              proven to be a most valuable model for studies on the interaction of energy
              metabolism, neurotransmitter metabolism and nerve cell physiology during
              anoxia. By learning the mechanisms by which the turtle brain reduces energy
              costs, valuable insights will be provided into the processes underlying the
              harmful changes that occur during oxygen lack in human stroke.
