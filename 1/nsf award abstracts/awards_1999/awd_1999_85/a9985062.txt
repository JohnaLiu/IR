The purpose of this proposal is to develop the
              nano-scale self-assembly processes for electronic devices and interconnect. 
              Novel multi-element modules for logic and memory, created by integrating
              advanced CMOS technology and self-assembly processes, will be designed,
              fabricated, characterized and optimized for functionality and performance
              beyond the current lithography limit.  Process development will focus on the
              surface interaction and perturbation that affects the physical mechanism of
              self-assembly and Ostwald ripening.  

Two major components to facilitate
              timely penetration of research to education will be implemented.  This is
              critical for semiconductor research due to the very short life cycle in
              technology development.  First, the open architecture in simulation software
              will enable graduate and undergraduate students to learn new research models
              with full numerical functionality and to exchange modules with other for
              comparison on the same platform.

Second, new research trends will help
              determine core course content and streamline course series to enhance learning
              efficiency.
