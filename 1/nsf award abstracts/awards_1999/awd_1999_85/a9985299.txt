Abstract    :
              This project integrates experimental physical organic chemistry and educational
              activities.  The research aspects of this project deal with the understanding
              of electron-transfer reactivity.  In particular, a unified and self-consistent
              model that can predict both absorption and emission processes has yet to be
              established.  These studies gain in importance since the formation of ion pairs
              for excited charge transfer complexes is considerably more complex than was
              initially thought.  Experiments to accurately determine association constants
              and absorption spectra for weakly bound complexes, together with time-resolved
              linear dichroism measurements, will be used to gain in understanding of the
              initial stages of photoinduced charge separation.

With this CAREER Award,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Dynamics Program
              supports the research and educational activities of Professor Bradley R. Arnold
              of the University of Maryland Baltimore County.  The research being pursued
              deals with the interaction of discrete chemical entities between which
              electrons are being induced by light to move from one molecule to another. 
              This is relevant to such studies as biological photochemistry such as
              photosynthesis and also to molecular devices.  The educational aspects of the
              proposal deal with improving students' understanding of how computers interface
              with laboratory equipment and is being pursued in a hands-on, discovery
              approach.
