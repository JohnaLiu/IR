Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the 1,2-heteroatom functionalization, in water, 
              of olefins, primarily with osmium and tungsten catalysts.  The resulting
              products of olefin oxidation will be converted to "spring-loaded" electrophiles
              that can react with a wide variety of nucleophiles, but not with water, and
              without the need for direction from harsh reagents or complex catalysts. 
              Mechanistic considerations reveal that using water as solvent should improve
              these processes.  

With this award in the Technology for Sustainable
              Environment component of the EPA/NSF Partnership for Environmental Research,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities are supporting the research of Dr. K. Barry
              Sharpless of the Department of Chemistry at the Scripps Research Institute.
              Professor Sharpless will focus his work on developing methodology for olefin
              oxidation reactions in water and on aqueous-phase methods for the use of
              oxidized products to construct useful molecules.  The work has potential impact
              on the pharmaceutical industry wherein highly reliable, aqueous-phase reactions
              should be available for the preparation of complex structures bearing
              biologically relevant functionality.
