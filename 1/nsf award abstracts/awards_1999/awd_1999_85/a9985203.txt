              ABSTRACT:

Gille/9984203
This CAREER award provides funding to examine how
              the Southern Ocean functions in a global oceanic heat balance.  The PI will
              examine both zonal and meridional flow employing both a numerical process study
              to investigate time-variability and wind-forcing around the Antarctic
              continent, and float measurements of southward eddy transport of heat and other
              properties across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC).  In the education
              portion of this proposal, the PI requests funding to develop a computer lab
              course on data analysis and provide research opportunities for undergraduates
              and graduate students.
