Abstract

Randomized computation has become one of the major
              research fields
in Computer Science since its emergence in the late
              1970's.
In spite of its seemingly enhanced power, as far as we
              know,
randomness may not provide any computational advantage 
(by more than a
              polynomial factor) over determinism.
The first objective of this project is to
              investigate the issue of
reducing randomness in computation via explicit
              combinatorial constructions.

Derandomization in space-bounded computation is
              the major subject to
study here, with the focus on pseudorandom generator
              constructions.
In particular, the constructions of pseudorandom generators for
              constant-width
read-once branching programs, and of discrepancy sets for
              combinatorial
rectangles are to be examined.

Derandomizing the well-known
              randomized log-space algorithm for 
undirected graph connectivity problem will
              be investigated further.
In the meantime, a variant of the connectivity
              problem
in the model of directed graphs with tree structures will also be
              examined,
hoping this can provide a better understanding of the relationship
              between 
non-deterministic and deterministic computations.

An advanced
              topic course (graduate or undergraduate) on explicit
combinatorial
              constructions and their applications will be designed.
The goal of the course
              is to enable the students to attain a solid
understanding of the mathematical
              foundation of explicit
constructions as well as their applications to
              algorithm design
and computational complexity.

Mobile computing over
              wireless channels has emerged as a rapidly growing
technology and gained a
              large amount of attention in recent years.
The highly asymmetric nature of the
              communication environment
in this context gives rise to many new challenges
              concerning the
issues of information dissemination and retrieval. Indexed
              data
scheduling is to design data broadcast schemes that
minimize both the
              average waiting time and energy consumption
of the clients in retrieving
              information on air.
Another objective of this project is to investigate 
the
              possibility of applying the ideas from indexed data scheduling
to the design
              of communication protocols for multimedia applications
in wireless mobile
              communication networks.
