Abstract    :
              The Oyate Consortium consists of five Lakota reservation colleges and
              universities (Oglala Lakota College, Sinte Gleske University, Sitting Bull
              College, Sisseton-Wahpeton Community College, and Si Tanka College).   This
              award follows an initial MIE award that provided substantial network
              infrastructure, physical infrastructure, personnel infrastructure, and course
              and curriculum development aimed towards the development of Science,
              Mathematics, Engineering, and Technical Education (SMETE) capacity at Native
              American colleges.  This award will continue these activities building upon
              existing infrastructure to develop new information (Information Technology BS
              and an MS in Environmental Science, articulations with additional
              non-reservation colleges and universities, and additional outreach to Native
              American Schools (at least 10).  Additionally, methods of institutionalization
              of the MIE accomplishments will be pursued including the development of an
              endowment for SMETE capacity and the means for providing housing for faculty
              and, perhaps, for students at the campus sites.
