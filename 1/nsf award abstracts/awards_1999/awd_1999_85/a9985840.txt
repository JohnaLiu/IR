Diapycnal mixing at straits and sills is
              observed to vary significantly from one location to another.  Understanding the
              cause of this variation is important to climate modeling.  The PI hypothesizes
              that planetary rotation is responsible for the observed variability.  Funds are
              provided to characterize the structures and quantify the rates responsible for
              mixing in rotating, hydraulically controlled flows using large eddy simulation
              modeling.  In particular, the dependence of these characteristics on the ratio
              of the channel width to internal Rossby radius of deformation will be
              determined.
