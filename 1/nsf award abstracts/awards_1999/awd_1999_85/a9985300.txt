Abstract    :
              This project has as its goal the integration of research and educational
              activities.  The research activities involve the determination of thermodynamic
              binding parameters for a number of biologically important ion-pairing
              interactions involving ammonium and guanidinium groups.  These determinations
              will be made in aqueous solution using a series of cationic cyclodextrin
              derivatives and appropriate anionic guests.  Methods employed for these studies
              will include titration calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy and molecular
              modeling.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry  Program
              supports the research and educational activities of Professor Paul J. Smith of
              the University of Maryland Baltimore County.  Professor Smith will integrate
              research and education by involving students in the study of chemical problems
              that are at the interface between chemistry and biology.  The research
              exploring the binding of biologically important ions will indeed have important
              ramifications in biochemistry and in molecular design.
