Abstract    :
              This project aims for fundamental understanding of the basic formation and
              evolution of Ga2O3 on GaAs. Collaborators at Motorola have employed
              photoluminescence and capacitance-voltage measurements to show that the
              Ga2O3/GaAs(100) interface is unpinned, but the detailed atomic and electronic
              structure of the interface is unknown. In order to unpin the Fermi level, the
              binding of Ga2O3 to GaAs must be sufficiently strong that the clean surface
              states are pushed into either the conduction or the valence bands and no new
              pinning states are formed. The approach in this project is to use
              cross-sectional and in-plane scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and
              spectroscopy (STS),  to determine chemical bonding and electronic structure at
              the Ga2O3/GaAs interface.  Additionally, the chemistry of the Ga2O3 growth
              process using O, O2 , and O3 oxidation sources will be investigated.

The
              project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science
              having high potential technological relevance. While thermal oxidation of
              silicon forms an excellent oxide
along with an electrically passive
              oxide-semiconductor interface, there is no current commercial
process to form
              gate oxides on GaAs.  This dielectric is highly significant because it could
              underpin a new MOS-like technology based on GaAs with advantages in both
              electronics and photonics. The research will contribute basic materials science
              knowledge at a fundamental level to new capabilities in electronic/photonic
              devices. A variety of fundamental issues are to be addressed in these
              investigations. An important feature of the program is the integration of
              research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and
              technologically significant area.
