Abstract    :
              Teaching ethics across the engineering and science curriculum remains more of an
              aspiration than a reality at many, perhaps most, colleges and universities. The
              Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at Illinois Institute of
              Technology has developed a successful approach to this subject, with a series
              of summer workshops for faculty at IIT and elsewhere.  This project will
              transfer to faculty at science and engineering programs at approximately sixty
              other campuses what IIT has learned about teaching ethics across the
              curriculum. The project includes: a) an intensive seven-day summer faculty
              workshop to develop specific materials to use in class and the skills and
              confidence to use them; b) a required testing of those materials in class at
              the home institution; and c) an evaluation of the results (a faculty
              self-report, student assessment, and follow-up questionnaires). Not only will
              faculty at numerous campuses be taught both to integrate ethics into their own
              technical courses and how to help other faculty do the same, but their efforts
              will be tracked and assessed and their best work disseminated nationally.
