Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to search for radio signals resulting from neutrino initiated
              particle showers from the moon.  The signals would be detected by the NASA DSN
              radio telescope instrumented with appropriate receivers.  The detector volume
              capable of initiating such showers would exceed 10,000 km3.  NASA would provide
              120 hours of telescope time free of charge.  This proposal is being support for
              two years to prove the degree of usefulness of this technique for detecting
              ultra high-energy cosmic rays.
