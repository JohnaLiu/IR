Secretion is n important property of virtually all cells in
              the body, but to certain cell types like neurons and neutoendoctrine cells it
              is one of their primary functions.  For example, chromaffin cells of the
              adrenal medulla secrete catecholamines into the blood stream and comprise a
              large part of the "fight-or-flight response whereby most vertebrates including
              humans prepare themselves for escape or respond to other stresses.  In cells
              highly adapted for secretion the intracellular secretory vesicles recycle many
              times.  This essential function enables the cells to secrete on a continuous
              basis which is critical for communication with other cells.  The first step in
              recycling is the recapture of the vesicular membrane from the cell surface. 
              The mechanism of this endocytotic process has been debated for many years but
              is still unsolved.  We have described a novel rapid endocytotic mechanism in
              chromaffin cells that may be the main mechanism both kinetic and molecular
              experiments will be perform to attain a detailed understanding of the two
              processes.  These studies will contribute to our understanding of vesicle
              recycling in all cells that undergo regulated secretion, including neurons.
