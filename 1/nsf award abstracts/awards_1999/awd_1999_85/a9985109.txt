Title: CAREER: The Long-Term Effects of Technology
              on Microprocessors
PI: Doug Burger, University of Texas at Austin

The
              research funded by this CAREER grant is addressing three of the microprocessor
              design challenges posed by deep submicron technologies: slowing performance
              growth, decreasing reliability, and increasing power dissipation. This research
              is attacking these challenges by proposing new technology-sensitive designs
              across three design categories: individual microarchitectural cores, large
              on-chip memory systems, and chip multiprocessors.

The microarchitecture
              research is organized into two parts: a technology-based scalability analysis
              of current microarchitectures, to determine and quantify future
              microarchitectural bottlenecks, and an evaluation of the grid instruction
              processor--a new microarchitecture, containing two-dimensional arrays of
              functional units, which eliminates many of the microarchitecture bottlenecks
              that will arise from advancing technologies.

The research is also evaluating
              how multi-megabyte on-chip memory systems should be designed in future
              wire-dominated environments. Both the physical design (which will have
              sub-banks numbering in the thousands) and the logical organization (how to map
              data into caches with non-uniform, position-dependent latencies) are being
              explored.

Finally, the funded research is exploring ways of accelerating
              single-thread performance by adding new mechanisms to chips with multiple
              processor/memory tiles each.  These mechanisms include fine-grained computation
              migration, dynamic thread parallelization, redundant computation, and working
              set size-based dynamic allocation and adjustment of on-chip memory.
