Abstract    :
              This CAREER award to Professor Howard Fairbrother of Johns Hopkins University is
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry
              Division. The primary research objective is to study the behavior of self
              assembled monolayers and polyethylene surfaces when they are subjected to x-ray
              irradiation, and ion bombardment under ultra-high vacuum conditions.  A
              molecular level understanding of the surface modification processes will be
              developed. Results from these studies will provide a detailed picture of the
              evolving interface during modification. Such information is important in the
              design of future treatment strategies and to the emerging field of polymer
              surface engineering.  The educational aspect of this program has two main
              components.  One is to use atomic force microscopy as a teaching tool in  the
              University's physical chemistry lab and in outreach programs. The other is to
              develop experimental physical chemistry modules for inclusion on the
              University's web site.   

This project  focuses on how x-rays, ions, and
              particles interact with organic surfaces to effect chemical transformations.
              The resulting knowledge of the changing surface will aid in the design of
              future surface treatment strategies and will be important to the emerging field
              of polymer surface engineering.
