Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to explore novel aspects of the bacterium,
              Acetobacter xylinum, known to produce exocellulose from glucose.  Recent
              findings by the Principal Investigator indicate that cellulose copolymers can
              be synthesized by this organism by feeding glucose and glucose analogs
              simultaneously.  There are four components in the proposed research: (1)
              synthesis of modified cellulose with nonnatural glucose analogs; (2) enzymatic
              conversion of natural polymers as feedstock for cellulose biosynthesis; (3)
              engineering cellulose synthase to alter incorporation profiles; and (4)
              structural characterization of these new polymers.  This research is part of
              the NSF/EPA - Technology for a Sustainable Environment (TSE) initiative.
