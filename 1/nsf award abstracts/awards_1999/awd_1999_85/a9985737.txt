This project plans to establish an integrated,
              distributed, information architecture and biodiversity database for fishes over
              the Internet.  Initially, the prototype system will integrate the fish
              databases of six institutions:  The Smithsonian Institution, the Harvard Museum
              of Comparative Zoology, the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, the
              Florida State Museum, Tulane University and the University of Kansas
              Biodiversity Center.  Information interchange will be effected through the
              ANSI/Z39.50 protocols and distributed servers.  Implementation of the prototype
              system will provide a proof-of-concept activity for the nascent Biodiversity
              Observatory network (BON).  This project will be the first application of the
              internet-based Z39.50 protocols for fish data, and will integrate with he
              developing concerns of an information network as part of the National
              Ecological Observatory network and BON.  This project is supported under the
              guidelines of the small Grants for Exploratory Research
