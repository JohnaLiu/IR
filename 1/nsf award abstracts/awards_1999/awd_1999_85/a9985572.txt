Time-Frequency Analysis of Multilinear Operators
and More
              General Nonlinear Operators

This proposal focusses on the study of
              multilinear singular
integrals. Singular integrals have played an important
              role
in harmonic analysis over the past fifty years and are very
useful in
              other mathematical disciplines such as for example 
partial differential
              equations. The main tool in the subject is 
Littlewood Paley theory, whose
              main message is that functions on 
Euclidean space should be decomposed into
              pieces whose frequency 
content lie in concentric shells around the origin.
              Passing to 
multilinear singular integrals one encounters the new phenomenon
              
that these multilinear singular integrals have translation symmetries 
in
              frequency space. Therefore it doesnt suffice to study concentric 
shells
              around the origin, but one has to study shells around any 
point in frequency
              space. 

Techniques have been develloped recently
to control the interaction
              of shells around different points in
frequency space, and the purpose of this
              project is to exploit and
further devellope these techniques and therefore
              better understand 
multilinear singular integrals. Multilinear singular
              integrals appear
for example in formal Taylor series of nonlinear operators,
              or as
explicit correction terms in an iterative scheme. A particular
emphasis
              of the project will be to investigate possible applications
of this theory to
              partial differential equations and other fields
in mathematics.
