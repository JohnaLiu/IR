RUI: High-precision, Fine-scale Depth Resolution
              Dating of Recently Accumulated Sphagnum Peat: Cross-Corroboration of Techniques
              and Development of a Novel Approach

Boreal and subarctic peatland ecosystems
              contain 1/3 of the world's soil carbon, represent a net sink for atmospheric
              CO2, and are located in regions where future climatic is expected to be
              pronounced.  Predicting the carbon cycling response of peatlands to changing
              climate requires models.  The investigators in this study have developed a
              model that relies on dating of peat cores in 2-cm increments from the surface
              downward.  Dating methods are available for peat younger than 150 years old
              (210Pb-dating) and older than 300 years old (14C-dating).  The researchers have
              proposed a new dating method to cover the present gap between 150 and 300
              years, based on atmospheric deposition of naturally occurring radioisotopes of
              beryllium and aluminum (10Be and 26Al). Before proceeding with this new method,
              it is critical that the immobility of atmospherically deposited 10Be and 26Al
              be demonstrated.  In this research, the investigators will specifically test
              the mobility/immobility question in an experimental, manipulative laboratory
              study.
