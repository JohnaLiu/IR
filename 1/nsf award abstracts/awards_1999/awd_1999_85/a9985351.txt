Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to study biomass pretreatment behavior to develop
              models that describe flow-through processes and explain differences from
              cocurrent approaches.  In particular, a novel mechanism based on dissolution of
              hemicellulose and lignin has been proposed, and models will be developed to
              compare this mechanism to current representations.  Batch solubility and
              kinetic data will be developed and used in the models to predict performance of
              flow-through systems when controlled by conventional kinetic behavior versus
              dissolution and solubility limits in different combinations with reaction and
              mass transfer effects.  Model predictions will then be compared to detailed
              time and position dependent flow-through data to determine which best describes
              experimental results.  The final goal is to provide new data, models, insight,
              and mechanisms that will facilitate the development and commercialization of
              low cost pretreatment technologies.  This research is part of the NSF/EPA -
              Technology for a Sustainable Environment (TSE) initiative.
