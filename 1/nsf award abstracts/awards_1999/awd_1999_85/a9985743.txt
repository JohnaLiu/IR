Abstract    :
              A GAOLI Faculty-in-Residency award supports a six month visit by the PI and the
              TRW facilities in Claifornia and follow-up work by a graduate student at both
              the home institution and the industrial site.  The topic of sutdy is
              development of design guides for surface mount electronic packages based on
              fracture cracks in mode II loading combined with mode I closing closing forces.
               The project will combine the PI's computational modeling skills and the
              experimental and fabrication capabilities and experience of the industrial
              partner.  Initially, a model for life cycle and calculation for interconnect
              solder arrays, based on a power law-governed energy release per cycle and on
              residual stress assumptions for the eutectic solder, will be validated by
              experiments.  It will later be expanded to other architectures.
