Abstract    :
              This research will focus on developing mesoporous materials that can be used as
              oxidation catalysts.  Semi-rigid organic oligomers will be used as
              structure-directing agents in the synthesis of novel mesoporous materials.  The
              oligomeric templates can adopt various regular geometries, and the resultant
              crystalline oxide structures can be analyzed.  From these observations a
              generalized synthesis model that can describe the essential molecular
              characteristics of a sol-gel template will be developed.  The specific
              molecular interactions affecting sieve formation will be studies using
              molecular dynamics as well as quantum mechanical techniques.  The effects of
              advanced sol-gel processing techniques, such as microwave heating,
              supercritical carbon dioxide template extraction, and ultrasonic mixing will
              also be examined.  An educational plan includes the development of an ensemble
              of teaching devices that will enhance low-level cognitive skills.  The
              development of oxidation catalysts is important, as oxidation processing have
              become critical reaction steps in the production of pharmaceuticals, aroma
              chemicals, food additives, polymer precursors, and insecticides.  The novel
              materials molecular modeling, and advanced processing techniques developed
              could expand the number of highly selective mesoporous catalysts available for
              the production of specialty chemicals.
