The purpose of the Biopolymers Gordon Conference, to be
              held June 18-23, 2000, at Salve Regina College in Newport, Rhode Island, is to
              facilitate the dissemination of ideas and information within the community of
              investigators who seek to understand and predict the properties of biological
              macromolecules. This community includes the physicists, mathematicians,
              chemists, and biologists.  This conference will focus on the discussion of
              experimental and theoretical results on nucleic acids, proteins, and their
              interactions. The structure, dynamics, and functions of these biological
              molecules have been the focus of this Gordon Conference since its inception in
              1964, making it a unique forum where these disciplines converge.
