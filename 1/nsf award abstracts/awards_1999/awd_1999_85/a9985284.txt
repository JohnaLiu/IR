Abstract    :
              The research component of this project focuses on two fundamental
distributed
              network problems.  The first problem is that of devising
an efficient method
              for accessing shared information (objects) in a
distributed scenario (Problem
              A); the second problem is probably the
most fundamental problem that arises in
              any communication network,
namely that of devising efficient point-to-point
              routing protocols
(Problem B).

More specifically, the PI proposes to
              accomplish the following
research items:

- to deliver solutions to Problem
              A in fixed-connection networks,
  taking into account several important
              network parameters -- such as
  link congestion, dynamic link costs, and
              multiple representations of
  objects -- and in cellular and ad-hoc wireless
              mobile scenarios.

- to deliver solutions to Problem B in conjunction with
              Problem A,
  with the aim of minimizing the cost of accessing an object.

-
              to deliver solutions to Problem B on its own, in wireless mobile and
 
              fixed-connection scenarios.
 
Not surprisingly, the problem of accessing
              shared objects and the
routing problem in distributed environments are
              strongly related in
many ways. For example, they are directly related in
              dynamic
scenarios. Therefore the PI anticipates that studying these
              two
problems together in mobile scenarios will help devise better
solutions
              for both problems.
