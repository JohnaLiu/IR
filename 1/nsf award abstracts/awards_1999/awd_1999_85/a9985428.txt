Abstract    :
              This Faculty Early Career Development Program award to Dr. David Patrick of
              Western Washington University is supported by the Advanced Materials and
              Processing Program in the Chemistry Division.  The focus of the research will
              be the use of thermotrophic liquid crystal solvents to prepare organic thin
              films with tailored and oriented building blocks.  This liquid crystal
              imprinting will also be used to prepare two component re-writable composite
              films with tailored alignments of building blocks in the films. The technology
              has potential applications in re-writable films controlled by lasers, and
              magnetic and electric fields.  Part of the educational plan is to revise and
              modernize undergraduate analytical chemistry curriculum with active
              participation of selected undergraduate students in part time research during
              the academic year and full time during the summer. Students will have
              opportunity to publish and present their findings.

Thin films with ordered
              and oriented functional groups will be prepared and characterized under this
              research. These materials with electrooptic and thermal properties will have
              applications in re-writable memory and storage devices.  In addition, the
              interdisciplinary approaches of the project will provide knowledge and training
              to undergraduate students from the undergraduate university in materials
              synthesis, processing and applications.
