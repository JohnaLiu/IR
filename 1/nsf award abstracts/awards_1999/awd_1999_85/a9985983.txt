              Abstract
9985983

The central region of Mexico experienced strong earthquakes
              on 15 June (Moment magnitude 7.0) and 21 June 1999 (M = 6.3).  The first
              earthquake resulted in 15 fatalities.  There were no deaths resulting from the
              second earthquake; however thousands of buildings were damaged, some severely. 
              The most notable effects occurred in unreinforced masonry (URM) structures,
              such as churches and small adobe and cane houses.  Site effects were possibly
              important in some of the cases.  A number of strong motion instruments recorded
              the ground motions in the affected area.

A research team of graduate
              students and faculty from the University of California at Berkeley (UC ) and
              the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), made a post-earthquake
              preliminary field investigation of seismic geotechnical issues, sponsored by
              the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER).

This action is to
              support the publication of a report on the key geotechnical aspects of these
              earthquakes.  This report is being made available in hard copy and via the
              World Wide Web, in order to disseminate the key lessons learned.

This action
              follows similar work that was supported following the 1985 Mexico earthquake,
              and is complementary to the support being provided to assist in the maintenance
              and distribution of data from the Guerrero strong motion array along the west
              coast of Mexico.  As with all post-earthquake reconnaissance investigations, it
              is expected that vital records and data will become available as a result of
              these recent earthquakes in Mexico.  From a scientific viewpoint, these large
              earthquakes act as full scale experiments that cannot be duplicated via
              controlled experiments in the laboratory or in the field.  It is through quick
              response reconnaissance efforts that the mostly-ephemeral data from these
              events can be recovered and used to further advances in earthquake hazard
              mitigation.
