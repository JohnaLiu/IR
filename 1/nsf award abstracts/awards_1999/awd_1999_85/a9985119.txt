Abstract    :
              This proposal the question of how an electric power utility can extract
              information about the composition of the instantaneous load without having to
              introduce a multitude of additional measurements is studied.  A statistical
              method to be employed allows to separate individual loads out of the aggregate
              of existing measurements.  These measurements are usually superposition of
              different types of loads and generators, as obtained, for instance, at a
              substation level.  The method called "Blind Source Separation" or "Independent
              Component Analysis" (ICA) requires only minimal assumptions, like independence
              of loads and linear superposition of currents, which can be assumed due to the
              basic properties of load distribution in realistic power networks.  ICA has
              been applied successfully for the solution of technical problems previously,
              and, although it has never been employed for power systems, preliminary  data
              given indicate that the method provides a powerful and reliable way of
              achieving load profile separation and identification.  It is also conjectured
              that this method is suitable for harmonic injection identification.  More
              generally, it is suggested that ICA may become a powerful method to achieve
              dimensionality reduction of data in a multitude of applications in power system
              analysis, operations and control.
