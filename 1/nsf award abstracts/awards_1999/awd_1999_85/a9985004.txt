Photonic microstructures may enable the development of
              high-density
photonic integrated circuits with unprecedented optical
              information
processing capabilities.  Their success critically depends upon
              the
availability of accurate and efficient modeling techniques to
              understand
and exploit the novel effects that emerge as the dimensions of
              optical
devices are reduced to the length-scale of the optical wavelength. 
              The
primary objective of the proposed research plan is to develop
              advanced
first-principles simulation tools based on the
              finite-difference
time-domain method for modeling electromagnetic wave
              propagation in
photonic microstructures.  These tools will be used to
              investigate
dispersive and nonlinear effects in photonic crystals and
              antiguiding
structures in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.  The
              computational
models will be experimentally validated through collaborative
              work at the
University of Wisconsin and at the Hewlett-Packard Laboratories. 
              The
primary objective of the proposed educational plan is to
              enhance
electromagnetics education through the use of innovative
              teaching
approaches in two core undergraduate electromagnetics courses and
              the
development of a graduate-level course on methods in
              computational
electromagnetics.  Web-based lectures will be developed and
              assessed for
student use outside the classroom so that more time in-class may
              be used
for potentially higher value-added experiential activities.  
              Numerical
methods will be incorporated into both undergraduate and
              graduate-level
courses.
