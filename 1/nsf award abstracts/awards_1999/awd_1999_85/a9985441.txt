ABSTRACT
----------------
Software architecture research has yielded
              numerous techniques for
developing complex applications by focusing on the
              composition of
coarse-grain software components.  However, existing
              architecture-based
approaches have typically modeled systems as "one of a
              kind;" additionally,
they have failed to ensure consistent transfer of
              architectural properties
to a system's implementation.  Realizing the full
              potential of software
architectures requires a more realistic approach, in
              which systems are
modeled and implemented as members of an application family.
               This project
focuses on the design, implementation, and empirical evaluation
              of
techniques for supporting architecture-based development of
              software
application families.  Three general issues are studied: (1)
              notations for
modeling application family architectures; (2) mechanisms for
              refining
family architectures into their implementations; and (3) nature of
              software
connectors--services facilitating component interactions--and their
              role in
controlling non-functional properties (e.g., performance, security)
              across
applications in a family.  This research will augment the
              current
model-centric focus on architectures with a system-centric perspective
              and
provide principled support for heterogeneity and reuse, two cornerstones
              of
developing application families.  The research will also serve as a
              vehicle
for modernizing the software engineering curriculum, by exposing
              students to
the impact of architecture-based and application family-based
              development on
fundamental software engineering principles
