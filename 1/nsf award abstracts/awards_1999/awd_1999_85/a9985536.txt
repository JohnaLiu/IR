Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of 4 + 3 cycloadditon chemistry
              and its use in the preparation  of natural products.  The intermediates to be
              prepared are halogenated, principally brominated, cyclic oxyallylic and allylic
              cations.  Cycloadditons followed by quasi-Favorskii rearrangement leading to
              the preparation of synthons for cyclobutadiene 4 + 2 cycloadditon reactions
              will be a key strategy of the project.   Synthetic targets which will be
              approached include poduran, sulcatine G, sterpurene, spatol and isocomene.  The
              research offers a sound project for the training of graduate students. 
              

With this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              is supporting the research of Dr. Michael Harmata of the Department of
              Chemistry of the University of Missouri-Columbia.  Professor Harmata will focus
              his work on the preparation of complex organic compounds using 4 + 3
              cycloaddition chemistry.  The approach could have broad impacts in the
              pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.
