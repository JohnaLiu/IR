Abstract    :
              This NSF/EPA Technology for Sustainable Environment project investigates an
              innovative technique of using an atmospheric pressure plasma for pretreatment
              of metal surfaces before application of protective coatings.  A non-thermal
              atmospheric plasma is a clean source of reactive radicals (H and OH) that can
              modify surface properties and improve the wettability of metals. A novel method
              is used to generate uniform non-thermal plasma in argon/hydrogen/H2O mixtures.
              This technique leaves no toxic residues or waste, unlike conventional methods
              such as sand blasting, alkaline and acidic treatment. A three phase research
              plan will investigate (1) the generation of the appropriate atmospheric
              pressure non-thermal plasma, (2) the nature of chemical and physical changes on
              the surface of steel that take place upon treatment with non-thermal plasma,
              and (3) the effectiveness of anti-corrosive coatings such as adhesion,
              adsorption or chemical reactivity of the coating material to steel
              surface.

At the end of the project period, the viability of the technique
              for pretreatment of metal surfaces for industrial application will be
              demonstrated.  This non-polluting alternative to treating surfaces with
              chemicals also has the advantage of providing better binding of the surface and
              the coating due to the uniform hydroxylation of the surface. This is
              significant to the potential adoption by industry, with both environmental and
              economic impact.
