Abstract    :
              This research project takes as its principal objective the development of a new
              class of macroeconomic models to be used in forecasting and in evaluating
              alternative fiscal and monetary policies. Each of these models will be built
              around an analytic framework that meets the high standards for theoretical
              rigor and internal consistency demanded by academic economists, but will remain
              detailed and flexible enough to be used in the forecasting and simulation
              exercises demanded by policymakers. By combining the power of models currently
              used by academics with the flexibility of models currently used by
              policymakers, the hybrids developed here will exploit the strengths of both
              types of existing macroeconomic models.
