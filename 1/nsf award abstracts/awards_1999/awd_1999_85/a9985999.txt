Abstract    :
              The central goal of this project, the Federal Elections Project, is to mesh the
              2000 United States federal election results at the precinct level with the
              demographic data from the 2000 U.S. census.  The investigators will gather data
              for all federal elections, specifically for president and vice president,
              senator, and representative.  Although the focus is on federal offices, the
              data set will also include results from the eleven states holding gubernatorial
              elections in 2000.  The merging of election and demographic data are especially
              critical now that new techniques of ecological inference allow the study of
              numerous political questions unitizing aggregate data.

The Federal Elections
              Project allows the researcher and other scholars to carry out a number of
              studies on several different topics.  Continuing their current research on
              racial redistricting and realignment, they will use data to estimate and
              explain the level of racial polarization in 2000 around the nation.  In a
              related vein, they will study the evolution of participation and partisanship
              of Latino voters - - the fastest growing segment of the electorate.  They will
              also launch a much more thorough study of the geographical basis of
              partisanship.  And they will develop a measure of the underlying partisanship
              for each precinct, county, congressional district in America.

These data
              will be of immense value to scholars interested in elections and political
              behavior.
