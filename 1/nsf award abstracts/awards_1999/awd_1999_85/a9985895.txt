Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the mechanisms of selected chemical reactions. 
              The focus is on olefins having one or more conjugated double bonds, whereupon a
              detailed understanding of the consequences of rotations about essential single
              bonds in the ground state and double bonds in the excited state will be sought.
               These processs are important in determining natural responses to light. 
              Methods will be developed for the application of single-value decomposition
              with self-modeling to these problems, including the mechanism of the photocycle
              of bacteriorhodopsin.

With this Award the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program (Bimolecular Processes) of the Division of Chemistry
              continues support for the research program of Professor Jack Saltiel of Florida
              State University.  Professor Saltiel's research explores the fundamental nature
              of light-induced chemical reactions and develops new methods for exploring
              these changes.  Some of the applications are related to Vitamin D formation and
              in triggering the visual process and photosynthesis.
