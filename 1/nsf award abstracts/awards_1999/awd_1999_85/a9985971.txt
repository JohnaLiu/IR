              Instrumentation: Prototype Development of the Simultaneous Optical
              Multiprocessor Exchange Bus Computer

The Department of Electrical and
              Computer Engineering at Drexel University will purchase digital design and test
              equipment, optical design and test equipment processor boards, programmable
              logic design equipment, software, and personal computers to support
              programming, designing, testing and debugging activities.  The focus of this
              research is on the Simultaneous Optical Multiprocessor Exchange Bus (SOME-Bus)
              computer network architecture.  Work on the SOME-Bus involves multidisciplinary
              research in computer architecture and networks, optoelectronic devices, fault
              tolerance, performance analysis (mathematical modeling and simulation), and
              VLSI design.  Its purpose is to create an optoelectronic prototype of the
              SOME-Bus, a research platform that will demonstrate the enhanced performance
              necessary to support current and future data processing and scientific
              processing requirements.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects, in particular:

1. Prototype development of the SOME-Bus computer
              network architecture.
2. High-sensitivity high-bandwidth detectors based on
              heterodimensional contacts.
