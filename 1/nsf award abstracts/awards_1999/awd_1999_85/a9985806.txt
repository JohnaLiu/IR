Abstract    :
              This grant supports the work of one of the distinguished practitioners of
              statistical mechanics.   During the last two decades, starting with work in two
              dimensions with applications to surface properties, this PI's work has evolved
              towards a variety of topics, which are centered on a study of defects such as
              domain walls.  This grant supports work in four projects consisting of: (1)
              Novel anisotropic scaling phase boundaries in equilibrium crystal shapes, (2)
              Long range reconstruction order in growing crystal surfaces, (3) Applications
              of dynamic absorbing state phase transitions in crystal surfaces and granular
              materials and (4) Scaling functions for one dimensional stochastic
              processes.
%%%
Steps at growing crystal surfaces are characteristic defects. 
              This grant supports research on a study of steps and other defects at surfaces.
               It continues the highly innovative and insightful research of this group on
              properties of growing crystal surfaces and related equilibrium phase
              transitions.  Specific questions which are addressed here are: the effects of
              anisotropies, possibility of surface reconstruction during growth, problems in
              crystal surface growth which are also shared with the subject of granular
              materials and a search for exact solutions for one dimensional problems.
