This award will provide support for featured
              speakers and graduate students to attend the 2000 Great Lakes Geometry
              Conference.  The objective of the conference is to describe recent advances in
              the areas of geometric analysis, 4-dimensionsal topology, and enumerative
              algebraic geometry.  This will be the second year of the conference, which is a
              collaborative effort of the geometers and topologists at the University of
              Wisconsin and Michigan State University.  An additional goal of the conference
              is to bring together at the conference a large number of graduate students in
              geometry and topology from throughout the midwest.
