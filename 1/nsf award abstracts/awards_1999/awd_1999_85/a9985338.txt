This career project involves the development of an integrated
              research and educational program in cellular mechanics. The central hypothesis
              of the research is that cells possess a specific mechanism to sense the
              compliance of their environment. To test this hypothesis, substrata with
              defined chemical and mechanical properties will be developed, and the responses
              of a variety of cell lines will be evaluated using optical microscopy, image
              processing and data analysis. This work will help advance our understanding of
              the relative importance of chemical and physical properties of the substrata in
              governing cell-substrate interactions. The goal of the education plan is to
              develop an educational thrust in biomaterials science and engineering at both
              the undergraduate and graduate level. Students will gain hands-on laboratory
              experience with the various properties of polymeric materials relevant for
              biomedical applications. Specific education innovations include incorporation
              of interactive teaching methods adapted from Peer Instruction; critical review
              of the literature; and interactions with outside representatives from the
              various aspects of biomedical engineering. Outreach will be achieved via Boston
              University's Pathways Program, which encourages local high school women to
              pursue careers in science and engineering.
