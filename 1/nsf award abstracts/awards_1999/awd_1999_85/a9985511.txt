Abstract    :
              Understanding of complex plasma-chemical processes has enabled many
              technological breakthroughs for thin-film deposition, etching, surface
              cleaning, and surface modification in silicon-based microelectronic systems. 
              The objective of this CAREER effort is to extend plasma processing technology
              to metal oxides, a nonsilicon class of dielectric materials, by elucidating the
              gas-phase and surface reaction mechanisms and the origins of electronic defects
              in metal-oxide thin films and their effects on the conduction mechanisms of
              these films.  Plasma diagnostic and surface analytical techniques are used to
              obtain quantitative information on plasma chemistry, identify reaction
              intermediates, and determine surface reaction-rate coefficients needed to model
              and control deposition and etching processes under real processing conditions. 
              Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to determine local surface electronic
              structure and point defects during initial growth of the ultrathin
              dielectrics.

An undergraduate semiconductor manufacturing option is to be
              established featuring a Semiconductor Manufacturing and Micro-Fabrication
              Laboratory to give chemical engineering students hands-on experience in
              fabricating and testing miniature electronic devices and micro-electrical
              mechanical systems (MEMS).
