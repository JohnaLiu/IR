Abstract    :
              Cyanobacter have evolved efficient metabolic pathways for the fixation of carbon
              dioxide (CO2) and its conversion to various metabolic products.  This
              capability can be exploited in the development of processes for biological CO2
              sequestration in combination with the production of useful products. 
              Polyhydroxyalkonates (PHA) represent such a group of product compounds whose
              biosynthesis, in the case of  photoautotrophic organisms, derives from the CO2
              incorporated into the cells through photosynthesis.  The goals of this project
              are to: (1) establish transformed strains of cyanobacteria with increased PHA
              production levels as well as improved PHA compositions; and (2) carry out basic
              kinetic studies of CO2 fixation and PHA formation in batch as well as
              continuous culture systems for wild type and transformed cyanobacter strains.
