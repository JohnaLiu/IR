Abstract    :
              Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) stimulate pathways consisting of
              sequentially acting protein kinases which regulate growth and development in
              eukaryotic organisms from yeast to mammals.  A lot of work has been done on the
              activation of these pathways, but much less on the inactivation.  This
              investigator is looking at the latter, by examining the protein phosphatases
              that inactivate them.  She has previously found that two protein tyrosine
              phosphatases (PTPs), Ptp2 and Ptp3, inactivate stress activated MAPKs, Hog 1
              and Mpk1 in yeast.  In this research the function of higher order complexes,
              Hog1-Hog1, PTP-PTP and Hog1-Ptp2 in the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) path
              will be examined since protein complexes are important in MAPK signaling.  The
              subunit organization of these complexes will be determined, mutations
              disrupting these complexes will be introduced, and the ability of these mutants
              to signal will be examined.  
 The signaling pathways that sense heat stress
              in eukaryotes are not well understood.  Another objective of this project is to
              identify the mechanism by which heat stress activates Hog 1 and the role of
              PTPs in this process.  The upstream regulators of the HOG pathway which are
              necessary for heat stress activation of Hog 1 will be characterized.  Ptp2 and
              Ptp3 have a protective function, since strains lacking them are heat stress
              sensitive due to Hog 1 hyperactivation.  Experiments outlined here will test
              whether PIPs are necessary for adaptation and if they prevent cross talk with
              the cell wall integrity pathway, which is activated by heat stress.
