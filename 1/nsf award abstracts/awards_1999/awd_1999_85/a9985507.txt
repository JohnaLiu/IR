Abstract    :
              This research aims at developing efficient techniques for modeling and
              simulation of complex systems-on-a-chip with millions of transistors, which
              contain mixed analog and digital circuits, even mixed-technology devices
              (microelectromechnical, optical, microfluid, etc). The focus is to explore
              behavioral modeling, simple-yet-accurate mathematical modeling, of a circuit in
              terms of its behavior. A systematic method based on symbolic network analysis
              is being developed to generate behavioral models from a circuit netlist.
              Application of traditional symbolic network analysis to large circuits is
              hindered by the exponential growth of the number of product terms with the size
              of a circuit, a problem known as term explosion. This project addresses the
              term problem by exploring determinant decision diagram (DDD) technology.  To
              generate efficient simulatable code, this project explores compilation
              techniques to compile behavioral models and to select models of right
              complexity. A new paradigm for parallel and distributed simulation is being
              developed to exploit the maximum currency and latency in mixed analog/digital
              and mixed-technology systems.
