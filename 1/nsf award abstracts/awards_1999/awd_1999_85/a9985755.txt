              Abstract
Gene E. Robinson, Principal Investigator

	The goal of this project
              is to determine whether the biogenic amines octopamine and serotonin influence
              the rate at which honey bees mature from working in the hive to taking on the
              more complex duties of foraging for nectar and pollen.  If biogenic amines do
              function in this way, studies will be undertaken to determine whether they
              interact with endocrine signals to effect this regulation.  The research will
              involve measurements of biogenic amines in the brains of individual bees,
              treatments of biogenic amines and hormones, and detailed behavioral
              analyses.

	Biogenic amines are known to exert short-term modulatory effects
              on a variety of behaviors in animals and humans but it is not known whether
              they also regulate long-term, developmental transitions from one behavioral
              phase to another.
