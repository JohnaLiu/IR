Abstract:  The American Association for the Advancement of Science
              , Directorate for Education and Human Resources Programs is convening a meeting
              of interested life science professional societies and faculty to develop a
              coordinated approach to building and connecting online undergraduate biology
              teaching tools.  The planning process will lead to an electronic "Gateway to
              Undergraduate Biology Education".  This gateway will provide a mechanism for
              collaboration of large societies who are developing specific sites and smaller
              societies that want to dock on the large site.  The meeting will provide an
              opportunity for input from a broad community of potential developers and users
              of the site.  It is planned to develop the site in a manner consistent with
              plans for the Digital Library currently under consideration at NSF.
