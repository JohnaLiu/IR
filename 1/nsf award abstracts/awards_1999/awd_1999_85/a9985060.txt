Abstract    :
              This CAREER project will develop and validate a method to determine linearly and
              nonlinearly viscoelastic properties of time-dependent materials using
              nanoindentation technology. A nanoindenter will be used to determine the load
              or displacement as a function of time of a viscoelastic material for prescribed
              displacement or loading history. Analysis and numerical simulation of the
              material response will be performed to develop a method of analysis for
              extracting the surface local relaxation or creep functions. The method will
              allow the measurements of viscoelastic functions for very small amounts of
              materials such as thin films deposited on substrates used in microelectronics,
              very small structures such as Micro-Electrical-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS),
              gradient materials with material properties varying spatially, and
              heterogeneous materials such as human bones. This method will enable the
              measurements of viscoelastic properties on the sub-micron scale that cannot be
              determined from conventional material testing systems that are designed for
              bulk material samples 

The educational activities are planned to fulfill the
              following objectives: (1) Involving more undergraduate students in research
              activities that allow them to experience the excitement in scientific research
              and discovery, as well as combining and using the knowledge they have acquired
              in different courses. (2) Introduce to the curriculum modern experimental
              techniques in mechanics, including the measurements of material properties on
              the sub-micron scale using nanoindentation. (3) Integrate the approach of
              Computer Aided Engineering into the Mechanical Design and Aerospace Structures
              courses, and introduce experimental content and manufacturing experience in the
              curriculum. (4) Develop graduate level courses that provide knowledge of
              mechanics to graduate students in the Web Handling Research Center, an
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center at Oklahoma State University.
