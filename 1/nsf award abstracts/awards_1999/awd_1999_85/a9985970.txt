Abstract    :
              Dr. Cortlandt Pierpont of the University of Colorado, Boulder is supported by
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Program for research on the
              coordination chemistry of quinonate, semiquinonate and catecholate complexes.
              Catecholate and semiquinonate chemistry of the platinum metals will be
              developed, with an emphasis on redox isomers related by shifts in charge
              distribution between the metal and the quinonate ligands. Polymeric
              ruthenium-quinonate complexes will be investigated. Pthalocyanine ligands with
              quinone functionalities conjugated to the ring will be studied. Novel chemistry
              of molybdenum-catecholate complexes will be considered.

Electrons are highly
              mobile in many quinonate, semiquinonate, and catecholate complexes of
              transition-metal ions, giving rise to unusual and unanticipated chemical,
              physical and electrical properties for those materials. Improved understanding
              and control of the redistribution of electronic charge within such materials is
              highly likely to be important in developing materials for use in microscopic
              electronic devices, as well as in description of critical aspects of the
              functioning of biological catalysts, and in  the invention of improved
              catalysts for non-biological chemical processes.
