This award provides sixty-seven percent partial funding
              support for the acquisition of a helium gas extraction system and mass
              spectrometric analysis facility that will be installed in the Department of
              Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology. The remaining funds necessary for the acquisition is to be provided
              by the Institute.
Recent experimental and empirical studies suggest that the
              radiogenic 4He content of accessory minerals can be used to explore the
              low-temperature thermal evolution of orogenic belts. In particular, U-Th-He
              thermochronometry of apatites allows mapping of near-surface temperature
              structures as a function of time. Because these structures are largely dictated
              by topography, the method is rapidly becoming a valuable tool for
              reconstructing the evolution of topography during the development of mountain
              ranges.
