In all mammalian species, marked daily
              variations in behavioral and physiological function are generated by an
              endogenous clock-like mechanism located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of
              the hypothalamus.  Although this generator of circadian rhythms has been
              profitably conceptualized and studied as a single, integrated clock mechanism,
              considerable research suggests that it is, in fact, comprised of multiple
              oscillators which interact, or couple, to generate coherent daily rhythms.  To
              date, the multi-oscillatory basis of the clock has proven difficult to study
              because separate oscillatory units cannot be temporally resolved in the normal,
              tightly coupled state.  Conditions which facilitate temporal reorganization of
              oscillators into an alternative coupled state in which they can be temporally
              resolved, moreover, are incompatible with the most important circadian
              techniques.  Specifically, previous studies have been unable to a) manipulate
              the timing of oscillators relative to one another to assess their interactions
              or b) probe their responses to light pulses which normally synchronize the
              clock mechanism with environmental day.  The present proposal utilizes a novel
              preparation in which circadian rhythms of hamsters are split into two distinct
              components which may be separately controlled with manipulations of the
              light/dark environment.  The proposed experiments will allow for the first time
              a description of the most informative outputs of component oscillators within
              the SCN.  Additionally, the nature of interactions between oscillators,
              postulated on mathematical grounds, can be tested empirically by manipulations
              of the relative phase relationships between component oscillators. These
              studies will be juxtaposed with manipulations of oscillator relations in the
              normal, unsplit state.  These studies may suggest new avenues for rapid
              manipulation of human circadian rhythms.
