Abstract    :
              These experiments will investigate the conditions and processes by which an
              avian species, the pigeon, learns higher-order  (abstract) concepts.  Such
              concepts are overarching rules and are basic to standard laboratory tasks of
              matching to sample (MTS) and same/different (S/D). In MTS, pigeons learn to
              choose a comparison picture that matches the sample. In S/D, pigeons learn to
              choose a second picture (same response) when it matches the sample or a white
              rectangle (different response) when the two pictures do not match. Concept
              learning is shown by the ability to perform accurately with novel stimuli. 


                  Pigeons are ideally suited for these investigations because concept
              learning and alternatives can be studied in detail not possible with most other
              species.   Evidence indicates that pigeons learn concepts when they respond 20
              or more times to the first stimulus prior to making a choice.   Fewer responses
              result in either configural-pattern learning or a stimulus-response (chaining)
              learning. Neither leads to concept learning.  Special tests reveal which type
              of learning (concept, pattern, S-R chaining) has occurred. Understanding these
              different types of learning is one of the most important goals of the science
              of behavior.   The results from these studies may be applicable to other
              species and learning environments (e.g., education).
