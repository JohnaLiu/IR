Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the bilingual education on the island of Corsica.
              French replaced the indigenous language, Corsican, in schools early in the
              century, but more recently ethnic Corsican nationalism has brought Corsican
              back to the educational system. This bilingualism has been problematic and the
              researcher will document patterns of classroom interaction and the "implicit
              models of language, culture and identity embedded in them." It will focus on
              the kinds of language competencies and attitudes children acquire in the
              bilingual school, as well as on the social consequences of minority language
              skills for the children and community. Overall, the project will analyze
              collective notions about the future of Corsican ethnic identity, and how these
              shape and are shaped by schooling. The research address broad theoretical and
              practical issues related to the schooling of ethnic and linguistic
              minorities.
