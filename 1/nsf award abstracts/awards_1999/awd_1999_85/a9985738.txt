Abstract    :
              9985738

An international conference "Statistics:  Reflections on the Past and
              Visions for the Future" will be held March 16-19, 2000 at the University of
              Texas - San Antonio.  Although the meeting is in honor of the 80th birthday of
              C. R. Rao, the primary focus of the conference will be to provide a forum for
              participants to meet and discuss the changing face of statistical research. The
              topics will include multivariate analysis, environmental and ecological
              statistics, biostatistics, genetics, image processing and other contemporary
              research areas that reflect the enormous contributions of C. R. Rao to the
              field.  The meeting encourages students and young researchers to engage in
              fruitful dialog with senior statisticians. This proposal provides funds to
              ensure that U.S. participants will be able to hear and network with the best
              experts on these topics from this country and from abroad, and to provide
              access to the conference for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, new
              researchers, and members of underrepresented groups
