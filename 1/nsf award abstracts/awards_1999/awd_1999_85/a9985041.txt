Abstract    :
              Chuang-kang Shih (9985041)

This project, a five year CAREER grant, involves
              the training, research and educational activities of a junior PI from the
              University of Illinois. Dr. Shih will receive training an anthropological
              demography at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as in mathematics
              and statistics at UIUC, and will then undertake a research project on the Moso,
              a duolocal matrilineal group in southwest China. The Moso are demographically
              interesting because the live in matrilineal households that do not contain any
              conjugal subunits. The Moso have maintained extremely low fertility rates,
              appearing to contradict the demographic transition theory that contends that
              "traditional" populations experience high fertility, which then declines with
              modernization. The research will serve as a test of that theory and will
              involve a comparative study of family systems and their demographic
              implications of the Moso as well as three other (culturally different) ethnic
              groups that live in the Moso area. During the research component, Dr. Shih will
              train both undergraduate and graduate students in anthropological and
              demographic methods.
