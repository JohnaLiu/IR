Abstract    :
              The program is an integrated research and teaching effort in the field of
              Organic Photonic Materials and Plastic Optoelectronic Technologies. The
              proposed research will focus on the study of charge-transfer in photorefractive
              polymers and light-emission in conjugated molecules and polymers. The research
              will consist of three major tasks that are highly connected. One area is the
              study of electronically engineered photorefractive polymers in which the
              relative energy of the frontier orbitals of the sensitizer, transport molecule,
              and the chromophore are controlled and systematically varied with the goal of
              developing new materials with sub-ms response times. The second area includes
              the development of photorefractive polymers based on two-photon absorption
              sensitizers. The third area includes fabrication, testing, and modeling of
              organic electroluminescent devices based on a new generation of
              photo-addressable molecules and polymers with controlled frontier orbital
              energies and good photochemical stability with emphasis of developing  full
              color displays on plastic substrates.

A broader goal of the program is to
              use the proposed multidisciplinary teaching approach as a vehicle to create
              equivalent curriculums in other universities and educate students for
              cross-disciplinary and knowledge-based career environment for the
              optoelectronics and information technology industry (specifically, low cost,
              light weight, flexible optoelectronic devices).This program will sustain and
              strengthen an existing partnership between scientists from several departments
              including Optical Sciences, the Departments of, Chemistry, Physics, and
              Materials Science and Engineering at The University of Arizona.
