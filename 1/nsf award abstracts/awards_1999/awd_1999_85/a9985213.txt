Abstract    :
              Dr. Steven P. Nolan, Chemistry Department, University of New Orleans, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              of the Chemistry Division for studies to determine   bond strengths in
              organometallic compounds and for the development of ruthenium mediated olefin
              metathesis catalysts. The thermochemistry and reactivity of nucleophilic
              carbene modified complexes will be explored. These investigations will be
              extended to organorhodium systems and to the replacement of cyclooctadiene by
              phosphine ligands in platinum and palladium complexes. In a separate study,
              neutral 16 electron ruthenium carbene complexes will be developed as olefin
              metathesis catalysts. 

Thermodynamic data provides a quantitative basis for
              understanding reactivity in reactions, including catalytic reactions.  The
              feasibility of new reactions can be predicted and design of new catalysts can
              be   optimized.  The available thermodynamic data on organometallic compounds
              is limited.  This research will provide basic information on the enthalpy for
              breaking bonds to metals and the application of this data to the development of
              important catalysts.
