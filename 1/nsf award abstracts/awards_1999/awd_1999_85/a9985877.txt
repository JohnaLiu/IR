Abstract    :
              The Duke University Phytotron - a national facility for controlled environment
              research on plants - was established in 1968 with funds from the National
              Science Foundation (NSF) and Duke University. The Phytotron houses 48
              artificially lighted controlled-environment (CE) growth chambers, six research
              glasshouses, offices, and laboratories for advanced research in environmental
              plant biology. These growth facilities permit precise control over
              environmental conditions, e.g., air temperature, light intensity and day
              length, nutrients, carbon dioxide, etc., which enables researchers to gain
              increased understanding of the complex interactions between plants and their
              environment. The mission of the Phytotron is to provide high-quality CE
              research space, expertise in performing CE research, and routine care of
              experimental plants to researchers from all over the United States.

The
              Phytotron is also an important education resource to the scientific community.
              One-third of all of projects are performed by graduate students as part of
              their thesis research. Postdoctoral researchers account for 29% of all
              projects. The Phytotron conducts educational tours to groups from grade school
              to college age from both on campus and across the region. On average, 500
              visiting scientists, students, and teachers tour the facility annually. 
              Continued support for the Phytotron enhances NSF's investment in ecological
              research and will allow the Phytotron to continue and expand its role as a
              national facility for controlled-environment research and education.
