Abstract    :
              This award was made under Section A. of the program announcement, NSF 98-102.
              The proposal maximizes available telecommunications access combined with
              emerging technologies and applications to enhance K-12 instructional tools. The
              twenty-fold increase in bandwidth to sixteen K-12 schools and library desktops
              in the state of Georgia utilizes a hybrid network of state-deployed satellite
              receiving systems for downlink capability and an already available ground
              Internet network (PeachNet) for uplink capability. Collaborators on the project
              includes EduLinc, Inc., Georgia Public Broadcasting, Georgia Board of Regents,
              and the following departments under the state government: Education, Technical
              and Adult Education, and Administrative Services.
