Abstract    :
              This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102, which covers K-12
              education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
              libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for twenty-four months to
              provide higher speed network connectivity to the Internet for two magnet high
              schools utilizing a unique partnership with the University of Arizona and
              building off the existing fiber backbone, I-Net, provided by the City of
              Tucson. Higher speed connectivity will allow the schools to achieve its
              objectives in utilizing multimedia applications and enabling a proposed
              collaboration with North Carolina schools with similar high speed access
              methods.
