Abstract    :
              The research supported by this proposal addresses all stages of communications
              technology development - from protocol design through implementation --
              identifying hard-wired technical biases and predicting emergent biases. 
              Hypotheses of biases in protocols from the physical to the applications layer
              are based on examinations of the protocols including the relevant regulatory
              regimes, economic distributions, and design processes. Hypotheses are tested
              using the extensive body of data on the use of emerging (e.g., pointcast, the
              web, real time interactive services) and adopted (e.g., telephony, broadcast,
              email, print) communications technologies as well as current conceptualizations
              of security and privacy. Enumeration of the values embedded in popular
              protocols, in addition to alternatives to these proposed protocols as
              appropriate, will be the result. This research will achieve the following
              goals: 1) amelioration of the problem of unwitting design of values by
              publication in technical forums, particularly in quality of service
              technologies; 2) prevention of the adoption of policies via unexamined
              technology by presentation in policy forums; and 3) integration of the methods
              considered, including evaluation of their efficacy in various situations, into
              teaching not only at Harvard but also in the curricula at several European
              universities.
