Abstract    :
              The project will examine the effects on seabird populations from introduction of
              Arctic foxes on some Aleutian Islands.  The hypothesis that the foxes
              introduced onto the islands have restricted the distribution and abundance of
              breeding and roosting seabirds will be tested.  That restriction may have
              reduced or eliminated the role of seabirds from producing the nutrient supply
              that nourishes the plant community.  The study will be conducted in parallel
              with a U.S. Fish and Wildlife program of removing foxes from the islands.  The
              USF&W conservation program provides an opportunity to apply the results of the
              research in a before and after situation so that the role of foxes on community
              structure may be examined more thoroughly.    The research addresses three
              topical areas in ecology: 1) the role of keystone predators in terrestrial
              communities; 2) the interplay between top-down and bottom-up processes in food
              webs; and 30 the importance of subsides between ecosystems.
