Abstract    :
              This CAREER project will focus on the study of physical and chemical processes
              that affect the dynamics of atmospheric aerosols. In particular, the main goal
              of the project is to couple a size and chemically resolved aerosol module into
              a state-of-the-science global chemical  transport model (CTM). Secondly,
              available global measurements of aerosol and gas phase species will be
              organized in order to compare numerical model predictions with field data, such
              as those from the ACE, TARFOX, and INDOEX experiments. This will assess the
              predictive capabilities of the model. 
	The educational objectives of this
              project are: (1) to integrate topics from the PI's research into his classroom
              teaching, (2) to incorporate new technology as an educational tool in the
              classroom, (3) to promote critical thinking and learning through discovery at
              the undergraduate and graduate levels, (4) to promote the participation of high
              school level Hispanic students in science and engineering activities, and (5)
              to assess the effectiveness of classroom innovations.
