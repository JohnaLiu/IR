Abstract    :
              This award will provide partial support of a Gordon Research Conference on
              photosensory receptors and signal transduction.  This is the first
              comprehensive conference organized around this theme in recent years and the
              first on this subject to be sponsored by the Gordon Research Conferences.  The
              conference has been organized in view of the recent breakthrough discoveries of
              new photosensory receptors and rapid progress on their activation and signaling
              mechanisms over approximately the past five years. The focus is on molecular
              mechanisms of receptor phototransduction and brings together investigators who
              study microbial, plant, and animal photoreceptors.  The meeting will provide a
              very much-needed opportunity to exchange information and ideas and for
              investigators to become aware of the diverse and incisive molecular tools
              available. It is expected that the conference will stimulate exciting
              discussion of emerging insights, general principles, and the most engaging
              mysteries on the cutting edge of photosensory signal transduction.  The meeting
              is to be held April 30-May 5 at the Gordon Research Conference site in Barga,
              Italy.   Nine sessions will address the following areas:

Phototransduction:
              insights from atomic structure and dynamics
Archaeal sensory
              rhodopsins
Mammalian visual pigments
New photosensory receptors in eukaryotic
              microbes
Cryptochromes
Phototropin
Phytochromes in lower plants &
              cyanobacteria
Phytochromes in higher plants
Photoactive yellow protein

The
              invited special evening lecturer will be H. Gobind Khorana, Nobel laureate, who
              will speak on rhodopsin structure and function.  Speakers have been chosen to
              represent the field as broadly as possible, and the meeting is designed so that
              wherever possible, young investigators will have an opportunity to present
              their work and ideas.
