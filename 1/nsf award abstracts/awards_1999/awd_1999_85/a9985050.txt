Abstract    :
              Current low power technology focuses on low power hardware designs
and OS-level
              power management. In contrast, compiler support for 
low-power is still in its
              infancy, mainly due to the fact
that most classical optimizations for speed
              and space    
typically reduce a program's overall power consumption as well,
              
making power as a separate optimization objective redundant. 
However,
              recent trends and developments in architecture and OS 
design have made power
              dissipation an optimization objective in its
own right. These recent
              developments are (1) more advanced OS-level 
power management support, (2)
              availability of low-power wireless 
communication, and (3) reconfigurable
              architectures with dynamic 
voltage scaling capabilities. This project
              investigates low-power 
optimizations in the context of the Java programming
              language. Java 
has become the language of choice for portable programming
              across a 
variety of different architectures, including mobile computers,
              
personal digital assistants (PDA), and embedded systems. Such devices 
rely
              on battery power for significant periods of their up-time, if 
not during the
              entire time of their operation, making power savings 
a crucial issue. The new
              low-power optimizations may trade-off 
execution time for power savings. They
              include application-driven 
power management, location-aware method/task
              mapping to remote 
servers, and instruction scheduling for reconfigurable
              architectures 
with dynamic voltage scaling.
