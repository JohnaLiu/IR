Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to demonstrate
              a novel method of very-high-throughput isotropic etching for semiconductor
              manufacturing.  Many steps in semiconductor manufacturing, especially the
              removal of photoresist, employ isotropic etching, often implemented with
              low-pressure plasma.  We have demonstrated that inductive thermal plasmas can
              be used for isotropic etching at atmospheric pressure, achieving very high
              local etch rates while simplifying equipment requirements.  We propose to
              develop a novel extended 'linear' plasma source, which will enable tool
              throughputs of 200-500 wafers/hour, much higher than conventional methods can
              achieve.  Commercialization of the technology will be pursued through licensing
              arrangements with existing manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment,
              who will in their turn be able to achieve compelling cost-of-ownership
              advantages in resist strip, backside etch, wafer thinning, and other isotropic
              etch steps.
