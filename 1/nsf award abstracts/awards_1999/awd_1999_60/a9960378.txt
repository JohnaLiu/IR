Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop
              commercial uses for conjugates capable of exploiting firefly luciferase
              expression in transformed plant cells to control their growth and physiology.
              The synthesis of a series of D-luciferin conjugates of plant regulatory
              substances is researched. In Phase I, we will test these conjugates for the
              ability to ablate specific tissues and cells expressing luciferase (luc)
              activity. Conjugates will be assayed in tissue culture and in whole plants for
              the ability to cause localized cell death in a promoter dependent manner.  Such
              compounds will be of general use for plant research on the control of
              development and gene expression and have the potential to produce
              agriculturally important sterile plant species in a reversible manner, through
              the use of selective application of substrate and choice of luc-fusion
              promoter.
