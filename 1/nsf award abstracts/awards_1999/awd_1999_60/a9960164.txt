Abstract    :
              This Small Technology Transfer Research Phase I project is based on the
              observation that ozonation of the facultative zone in organically overloaded
              hog waste lagoons renders the top waters nearly odor free.  This technique has
              lead to two further technical surprises:  (1) The low dose of ozone used is
              much less than the chemical demand and (2) Decreases in the depth of the
              accumulated sludge are observed. Ozone is suspected to be interacting
              synergistically with the lagoon microorganisms, especially the non-sulfur
              purple bacteria,
to restore balance to the system ecology. Waste volume
              reduction, fertilizer value, and pathogen control have environmental and health
              implications far beyond odor control.  This STTR will confirm the observations
              concerning ecological changes in ozonated lagoons, slurry stabilization, and
              pathogen control.  The U.S. production of hogs in the first quarter of 1999 was
              25.3 million head with an inventory of 59.9 million head. The annual rate of
              hog manure generated 117 million dry tons. There are approximately 70,000 hog
              farms 
and many of these farms use lagoons for waste storage. The ability to
              provide a simple, effective, inexpensive means of improving the stabilization
              potential of swine waste lagoons is a primary focus of the 17 major hog
              producing States.
