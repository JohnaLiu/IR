Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will lead to fast,
              sensitive, and compound-specific analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
              (PAHs) in air, water, soil, and sediment. Risk assessment demands
              chemically-specific analysis because the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential
              varies widely for PAHs with nearly identical chemical structures. The
              traditional chromatographic methods (GC or HPLC, often with mass detection) are
              slow and expensive. Fluorescence is amply sensitive, direct reading, and the
              data are inherently multi-dimensional. Prior research has shown that cooling
              Shpol'skii matrix samples to cryogenic temperature, exciting the fluorescence
              with narrow band tunable laser light, and time-resolved spectroscopy each
              enhance specificity.  However, technical challenges have prevented the routine
              utilization of these strategies individually, let alone in combination. This
              project will demonstrate that benzo[a]pyrene can be quickly analyzed in
              real-world samples by time-resolved excitation emission matrices acquired for
              Shpol'skii matrices at 77 K. Technical innovations central to the project are
              an extremely compact tunable ultraviolet laser, simplification of fluorescence
              lifetime methodology, and delivering the excitation light directly to the
              sample by a fiber optic frozen into the matrix. The new procedures and
              instrumentation will see applications in environmental site characterization
              and remediation, health research, and fundamental laboratory studies.

The
              initial commercial market is expected to be environmental testing and
              analytical laboratories. Once the feasibility of the TREEM direct fluorescence
              analysis is established, expansion to other markets, particularly in the
              pharmaceutical, agricultural and food industries is expected.
