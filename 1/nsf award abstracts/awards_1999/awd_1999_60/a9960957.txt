Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase I Project develop a low-voltage ferroelectric cathode technology
              based on ferroelectric films for application to cold cathodes for accelerators,
              high frequency devices, mass spectrometers and other instruments based on cold
              cathodes.  Ferroelectric materials emit pulses of electrons from their surface
              during rapid polarization reversal. High current density (up to 100 A/cm2) has
              been obtained using cathodes with thick ferroelectric layers, requiring
              excitation voltages in the 3-5 kV range. However, it is desirable to develop
              ferroelectric cathodes which require operating voltages in the hundred's of
              volts range, to make them more energy efficient and less susceptible to high
              voltage-induced breakdown. 

The primary objective of the proposed research
              program will be the development of low-voltage, high-current, reliable,
              film-based ferroelectric cathodes. This will be accomplished by advancing the
              current understanding of the material requirements and electrode configuration
              to maximize the electron emission current. It is expected that the proposed
              technology will provide high current, low voltage ferroelectric cathodes for a
              variety of applications requiring lower power consumption.
