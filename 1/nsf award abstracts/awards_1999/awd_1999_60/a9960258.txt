Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project deals with the
              development of a combinatorial method for the discovery of novel
              electrocatalysts for ozone generation.  Electrochemical ozone generators based
              on lead dioxide as anodic electrocatalyst have a major drawback in that the
              current efficiency for ozone production is only 10-15%.  There is, therefore,
              clearly a need for new, novel anodic electrocatalysts that will lead to the
              development of a new generation of electrochemical ozone generators with ozone
              current
efficiencies of up to 50%, and more preferably, up to 90%.  However,
              synthesis and evaluation of potential anodic electrocatalyst materials by a
              conventional project, a combinatorial thin film libraries of various metal
              alloys will be generated on microporous titanium substrates by vacuum
              deposition techniques using physical shadow masks.  The resulting libraries
              will be screened for ozone production electrochemically.  Our
innovative
              combinatorial screening process for ozone production will involve simple
              dye
bleaching/formation process.

Commercial potential of a new generation
              of electrochemical ozone generators one-compound-at-a-time approach is a
              lengthy process.  In this Phase I with high current efficiencies is enormous. 
              Commercial applications of these new generation ozone generators will be for
              water treatment, food processing, waste treatment, medical sterilization,
              biofouling control, and paper and pulp bleaching.
