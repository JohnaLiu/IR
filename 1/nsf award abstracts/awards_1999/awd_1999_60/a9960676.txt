Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project significantly broadens
              the monitoring capability of the Brims Ness continuous on-line monitor to
              include harmful, water-borne organic contaminants. It combines a new
              technology, molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) which are selective for
              individual organic molecules, with the monitor's quartz crystal microbalance
              (QCM) sensor device. This will expand contamination detection capacity to
              include dioxins, PCBs, furans and other toxic organic contaminants
which
              dominate the Super Fund priorities list.  This advance builds upon the success
              of another recently completed Phase I project which validated the performance
              of a low-cost, continuous on-line monitor to detect the presence of heavy
              metals in an aqueous flow. That project combined two existing, mature
              technologies, ion 
exchange resins to select individual heavy metal and other
              selected ions, and the QCM sensor device to measure the ion selection.  The
              technology will allow full automation of monitoring functions at sites which
              must now use periodic sampling to detect contaminants. The project will lead to
              a broad range of commercial 
applications including (1) municipal water
              utilities, (2) wastewater treatment plants, (3) process industries, (4) food
              processors, and (5) entities reliant on groundwater wells.
