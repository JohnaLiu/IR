Abstract    :
              This SBIR  Phase I project will research and develop multimode step-profile
              fiber resonators for internal reflectance spectrometric applications, both for
              absorption and luminescence.  Attenuated total reflection spectroscopy is used
              to measure the constitutive optical constants of a dielectric, or metal,
              analyte cladding layer replacing lengths of the primary optical cladding.  In
              conventional applications, optical fiber excitation is single-pass, coupled in
              one end and propagated out the other fiber endface.  Alternatively, with the
              proposed development, forms of fiber-optic resonators would store optical power
              increasing the spectral sensitivity for small absorption indices by enhancing
              the analyte cladding interaction.  One particular resonator type is a
              continuous fiber ring, i.e., no endfaces.  The practicable purpose of the
              proposed SBIR Phase I is to
develop the fabrication techniques for the fiber
              optical coupler component appropriate for such a resonator.   A unique fiber
              coupler is described.  This type optical coupler will, by design, couple modal
              power into the resonator selectively, predominately either TE/TM or EH/HE with
              low or high orders depending on the optimal modal distribution associated with
              the fiber sensor application.
