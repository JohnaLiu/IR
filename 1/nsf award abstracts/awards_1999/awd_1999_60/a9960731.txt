Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project concerns with the
              development of
novel nano-structured polymer electrolytes (NSPE) for solid
              state Li-ion batteries, low
cost, 'dye sensitized' solar cells and
              electrochromic devices. The electrolytes feature
high ionic conductivity and
              excellent mechanical strength, resulting from an ordered
structure on the
              manometer scale consisting of an epoxy scaffold and a polymer
              electrolyte
network. The unique structure is obtained by self-assembly during
              curing of the epoxy in
the presence of an immiscible block copolymer
              containing the ion-conducting phase.
