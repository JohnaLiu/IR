Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop magnetic
              tunneling junction (MTJ) sensors, specially designed and optimized for a
              sensitive magnetic microscope.  These miniaturized sensors, by exhibiting giant
              magnetoresistance (GMR) and working at ambient conditions, will enable
              construction of a magnetic microscope for imaging, characterizing, and
              investigating samples that generate minute magnetic fields at microscopic
              levels.  The microscope will "see" local field images resulting from the
              electrical current distribution of a Pentium chip, revealing any operational
              abnormality.  It will map magnetic domain structures of submicron particles. 
              Researchers can also use the microscope to investigate basic material
              properties such as superconductor flux-line structures and dynamics,
              biomagnetism, etc.  MTJ sensors are expected to have properties superior to
              spin-valves and Hall sensors.  Phase I will tackle issues critical to the
              microscopes development: 1) magnetic noise; 2) magnetic couplings; and 3)
              micromagnetics.  Phase II of this project will build a prototype of a new
              generation of magnetic microscope.

MTJ sensors have applications in magnetic
              microscopy for non-invasive characterization of semiconductor chips and
              magnetic films and media.  They can also be applied to read/write heads in data
              storage, remote-sensing, automotive control, electronic navigation and
              compassing, and non-destuctive evaluation.
