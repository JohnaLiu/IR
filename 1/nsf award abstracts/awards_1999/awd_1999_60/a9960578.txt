Abstract    :
              Ultrahard materials (UHM) possess many superior properties, making them highly
              desirable as industrial materials.  Unfortunately, these materials,
              particularly the hardest of all, diamond-like materials, cannot be used in many
              high-volume applications due to their low oxidation resistance, low thermal
              stability, and high cost.  For this reason, new, low-cost UHMs with comparable
              or even superior properties are required.  Calculations based on known
              thermodynamic and structural data predict that cubic carbon nitride,
              alpha-C3N4, will be significantly harder and much more thermally
              oxidation-resistant than diamond.  Despite significant progress made by
              researchers over the last decade, the formation of pure phases of this
              material, as well as others like it, has not as yet been accomplished. In the
              project, Ultramet will generate novel UHMs such as alpha-C3N4, cubic
              carbonazenide (cubic C(HN)), and composite ternary nitrides consisting of metal
              nitride nanocrystals and an amorphous silicon nitride (Si3N4) phase using a
              novel chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-based process.  This new process, which
              is kinetically driven, allows the formation of a large variety of ceramic
              materials at or near room temperature.

Applications: The proposed novel CVD
              processes will yield new UHMs such as alpha-C3N4, cubic C(HN), and composite
              ternary nitride/Si3N4 phases with hardness and oxidation stability equal to or
              exceeding those of cubic boron nitride and diamond.  The new processes will
              allow these new UHMs to be produced at lower cost and used in a much wider
              range of applications than current UHMs.
