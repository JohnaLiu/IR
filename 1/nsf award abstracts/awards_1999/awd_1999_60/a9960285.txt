Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will establish the
              feasibility of developing a greatly improved mass spectrometer based on the
              annihilation of positrons.  The project is based on the latest developments in
              techniques to accumulate positrons from a radioactive source in Penning traps
              using a buffer gas. The Advanced Positron Mass Spectrometer will use positrons
              to control precisely the ionization and fragmentation of complex molecules. The
              technical objectives of Phase I are to: (1) assemble an experiment
to
              investigate positron ionization mass spectrometry of biomolecules; (2) perform
              experiments to compare the performance of positron ionization of these
              molecules with currently used ion sources for mass spectrometry; and (3) carry
              out the conceptual design of a laboratory prototype system for Phase II. The
              Phase I feasibility experiments will be performed on the positron trap at the
              University of California, San Diego. If successful, this project will provide
              the basis for demonstration of a laboratory prototype of the
mass spectrometer
              in Phase II. Phase I and II will provide the foundation for commercializing the
              new technology in Phase III. This project addresses a 1999 critical technology
              of national importance, biotechnology.
