Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Reveo, Inc.
              involves developing the enabling technology for achieving the nearly unbounded
              digital storage capacity demands of the 21st Century--a problem that will
              plague all computer users from individuals to businesses to the government. 
              Rewritable optical storage media have many advantages over magnetic media. 
              Despite the advantages, such as greater density, capacity, and stability,
              rewritable optical storage media have not have not caught on because of high
              cost and slow, bulky read/write technologies.  A paradigm shift to
              three-dimensional (3D) optical storage media would allow for phenomenal storage
              density.  Reveo, Inc. has invented a variable-focal-length liquid crystal
              microlens array that could function as the enabling technology for a fast,
              simple, inexpensive read/write device for 3D optical media.  Coupled with
              active-matrix LCD technology, Reveo's microlens array could revolutionize
              digital storage, supplanting magnetic media with ultra-high-density 3D optical
              media.  This  Phase I project is a feasibility study in which Reveo firm will
              compare three designs of LC microlenses and fabricate a prototype microlens of
              the optimal structure.  In Phase II, the firm will fabricate the full array and
              develop a read/write device for 3D optical media, paving the way for full
              commercialization in Phase III.
In order to set the magnitude of the problem
              in perspective, consider that over 90 million computers were sold worldwide in
              1998 alone, and that figure is increasing rapidly.  Reveo proffers a variable
              microlens technology that will enable a commercially and technically viable 3D
              optical storage device  It is difficult to overestimate how keenly computer
              users will demand prodgious storage capacity in the future.  The commercial
              potential of a 3D optical storage device that holds almost 1 Tbyte/cm3 is vast
              in that it offers a viable long-term solution to multitudinous computers
              users.
