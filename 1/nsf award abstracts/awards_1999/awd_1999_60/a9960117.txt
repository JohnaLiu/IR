Abstract    :
              This  Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will develop integral
              resistors for high performance applications. Arkansas Microelectronics
              Development Corporation (AMDC) and the University of Arkansas . A novel
              fabrication technique involving amorphous silicon deposition followed by
              aluminum assisted crystallization and doping at low temperature will be used in
              order to achieve resistances ranging from 1 - 10 ohm-cm, an important range in
              high performance applications. Since this poly-microsilicon deposition process
              was developed at the University of Arkansas'Photovoltaics Center, the
              University of Arkansas (U of A) will act as the research institution. This
              patent pending deposition process will allow AMDC and the U of A to design and
              fabricate 0.1- 0.5 MW integral resistors which will, in turn, result in
              smaller, more reliable electronic packaging operating with greater overall
              substrate efficiency. Electrical substrates with integral passive components
              will not only provide a reduction in size, weight, power, and cost, but they
              will also improve electrical performance. Phase II will incorporate integral
              resistors with AMDC's proven integral capacitors. Space Electronics Inc (SEi),
              of San Diego, CA, will participate as a subcontractor in order to provide
              product demonstrations applicable to the current market. Matching funds from
              the Arkansas Science and Technology Authority (ASTA) will also be
              pursued.

Potential commercial applications are in the wireless industries
              (pagers and cell phones) where product miniaturization and weight reduction are
              essential.
