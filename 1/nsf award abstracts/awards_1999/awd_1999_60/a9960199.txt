Abstract    :
                      This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project aims to develop
              the automatic setup and control procedures necessary to commercialize its
              ultra-wide bandwidth transient digitizer product. The innovative use of
              superconductive properties, together with a novel error-correcting circuit
              architecture, results in the potential for the highest performance of any
              digitizer based on analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The HYPRES transient
              digitizer already provides bandwidth performance unsurpassed by any other
              ADC-based digitizer. However, perhaps the most important component for
              commercialization still needs to be implemented: the setup and control
              electronics that transform the digitizer from a laboratory tool to a commercial
              instrument. During Phase I, HYPRES will fabricate and measure digitizer chips.
              The necessary procedures and algorithms for setting up and optimizing chip
              performance will be determined and codified. A control unit will be designed,
              to be implemented in Phase II using VXI-standard electronics and a LabViewTM
              interface.
         The transient digitizer is useful for measuring the bunch
              profile of accelerator beams such as the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
              (RHIC). This instrument is also useful for both laser and target diagnostic
              work at the National Ignition Facility (NIF).
