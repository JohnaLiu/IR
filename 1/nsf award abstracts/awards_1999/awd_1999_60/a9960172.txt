Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I is aimed at developing a
              multi-dimensional Monte Carlo model to simulate micro-scale heat transfer in
              thin films. The proposed study will develop a multi-dimensional Monte Carlo
              model for the solution of the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) with the
              inclusion of all possible phonon scattering mechanisms and appropriate
              nonlinear dispersion relationships for frequency-dependent group velocity for
              phonon density of states.  As part of the study, simulations will be performed
              for single crystal materials with known dispersion relationships.  The model
              will be validated in part against available experimental data and in part
              against experiments conducted at the University of California at Berkeley (UCB)
              under a sub-contract. The Phase II study will extend the model to study single
              crystal superlattice structures and will focus on integrating the micro-scale
              models into an existing commercial software, CFD-ACE+, to enable simulation of
              heat transfer in microelectronic and MEMS devices.

The proposed study will
              result in a computational tool to aid in the design and fabrication of IC and
              MEMS devices that use thin films of dielectric and semiconductor materials. 
              The simulation tool will enable the design of devices with optimal thermal
              performance (and increased reliability) and thus reduce potential device/system
              failures resulting from poor heat transfer.
