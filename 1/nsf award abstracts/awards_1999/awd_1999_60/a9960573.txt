Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will utilize a
              novel carbon nanotube material to develop an innovative electrode structure for
              a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC).  The innovation in this work
              targets both performance and cost issues of PEM fuel cells by investigating
              novel catalyst support structures.  This effort capitalizes on the technical
              expertise of research groups at Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) and the Martin
              Group at University of Florida (UF).  The Martin Group, in the role of a
              subcontractor, will be responsible for nanotube synthesis.  Catalyzing the
              nanotubes is a task that will be shared by both groups; each bringing unique
              expertise to this project.  The catalyzed membranes will then be integrated
              into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) by PSI and tested for single cell
              performance.  The development of these support structures will also pave the
              way to a new single component MEA system, eliminating the expensive solid
              polymer electrolyte currently employed.

Successful development of the
              technology will substantially improve the performance and cost effectiveness of
              PEM fuel cells for vehicular applications.
