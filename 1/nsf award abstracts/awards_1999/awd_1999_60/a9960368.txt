Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phae I project will create tough, very
              high strength cermets from alumina, silicon carbide, and titanium carbide
              ceramics in cobalt and/or nicket matrices, using a new nanoengineered particle
              manufacturing technique.  Ceramic materials such as diamond, titanium carbide,
              silicon carbide, alumina, and others have superior hardness and wear resistance
              compared to tool steel and cemented carbide tool and die materials.  However,
              due to poor toughness and relatively poor thermal shock resistance and
              strenght, the use of these materials on metal cutting and forming applications
              is limited.  Through controlled chemistry and thickness, Phase I will apply
              interfacial coatings to the ceramic particles to provide superior bonding and
              load transfer to the particles in the resultant tool material.  This is
              expected to make cermet tools with mechanical properties approaching those of
              cemented carbides and tool steels, but with wear resistance approaching that of
              ceramics.

Cermet/ceramic tools with higher strength, toughness, and impact
              resistance will enable the application of high wear resistance ceramics to
              operations such as milling, roughing, forming, and other fabrication functions
              requiring impact toughness and strength.
