Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new
              ion-conducting polymer (ICP) for use in microcomposite polymer electrolyte
              membranes (PEM).  The project will build on previous work in which the
              viability of the composite approach to PEM for high temperature H2/O2 fuel
              cells was demonstrated.  In conjunction with Virginia Polytechnic Institute,
              new ICPs, with enhanced chemical stability will be developed. These novel ICPs
              will be combined with poly (p-phenylene bisbenoxazole) (PBO) substrates to
              produce PEMs that out perform the current state of the art fuel cell membranes,
              while retaining significant cost savings.  A well-known fuel cell developer,
              will evaluate the microcomposite membranes for key mechanical / physical
              properties to demonstrate feasibility of this technology.  The low-cost, high
              temperature, microporous PEM will address the serious problems (excessive cost,
              limited power / energy density, and water management issues) which are limiting
              the use of current PEM fuel cells in all electric based vehicles.  The primary
              objective of the proposed effort is to demonstrate feasibility of a composite
              PEM with chemical/mechanical stability to survive fuel cell operating
              conditions for 5,000 hours or more.

The development of high performance,
              solid polymer electrolyte fuel cells is essential for the success of next
              generation vehicles, providing power free of emissions (SOx and NOx).  Other
              applications include stationary power generation as well as low power (1 to
              50w), mobile fuel cells for battery replacements.
