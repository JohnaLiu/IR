Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new low-cost rapid prototyping method, based on inexpensive computer printing
              technology.  A variety of rapid prototyping technologies have been developed
              with equipment costing in the range of $30,000 to $200,000.  Costs like this
              and machine complexity have limited production to a few thousands of machines. 
               The printing technology, by lowering entry costs to the simple purchase of
              specialty paper and toner, could lead to a new manufacturing paradigm favoring
              small, just-in-time manufacturing.  Phase I will make sheets from simple hand
              sheet equipment and provide proof of concept.  

The business potential is
              estimated to extend to an initial 2,000 users of rapid prototyping equipments. 
              Applications are expected across a broad spectrum of engineering and
              manufacturing operations in industry.
