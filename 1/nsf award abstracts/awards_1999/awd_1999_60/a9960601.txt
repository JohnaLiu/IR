Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will investigate the
              spinning performance of melt spun fibers containing microencapsulated phase
              change materials (microPCMs).  MicroPCMs have been successfully incorporated
              into solution-spun acrylic fibers, significantly increasing their thermal
              energy storage capability.  However, of the billions of pounds of
              non-cellulosic fibers produced worldwide, melt-spun fiber production far
              exceeds the amount produced of acrylics.  With demand for acrylics expected to
              continue to decline over the long term, the opportunity for technological
              innovation in synthetic fibers clearly lies with melt-spun fibers.  The overall
              objective of Phase I is to acquire a fundamental understanding of the
              relationship between the spinning process, the polymer matrix containing
              microPCM, and the resulting product.  To achieve this the limits of
              spinnability of microPCM filled polyester and/or polypropylene will be
              determined.  This includes determining the maximum concentration of microPCMs
              for spinning continuity at 2000 m/min. and higher.  Anticipated benefits to the
              nation include (1) the commercial potential of melt-spun fibers and resulting
              fabrics with enhanced thermal energy storage capabilities, and (2) an
              enhancement to national security offered by the use of this technology to
              extend the endurance and survivability of members of the military services who
              operate in extreme environments.

Commercial potential
The commercial
              potential of melt-spun fibers and fabrics with enhanced thermal energy storage
              capabilities is enormous for the apparel (e.g., socks, gloves, jackets) and
              industrial insulation markets, where hot or cold thermal control is
              required.
