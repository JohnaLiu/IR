Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the
              concentration of aqueous process streams that is common in the food and
              pharmaceutical industry.  When the product activity is sensitive to
              temperatures above room temperature, process such as freeze-drying are
              employed.  Osmotic Distillation (OD) is a candidate for a lower cost method for
              concentration of a higher quality product, but has not been developed for the
              application partly because of potential failure due to penetration of the
              microporous membrane structure by the solution to be concentrated. The
              suitability of a new porous/nonporous membrane will be demonstrated for use of
              OD in fruit juice concentration.  The nonporous nature will avoid the failure
              mode described above.  The membrane is based on novel high water permeability
              polymers.  The high chemical and thermal resistance of this polymer will allow
              common sterilization methods to be used. This study will produce suitable
              modules of nonporous and porous membranes, investigate the relative efficiency
              of each in concentrating a model solution, and demonstrate their relative
              tendencies to 'wet out', or fail due to fouling of the membrane by process
              streams.

This lower cost process, if successful, can have an immediate
              impact in the preparation of fruit juice concentrate and pharmaceutical
              products without activity loss.
