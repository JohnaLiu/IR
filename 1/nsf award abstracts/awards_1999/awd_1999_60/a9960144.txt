Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the
              development of electrochemically regenerable ion-exchange resins. 
              Electrochemical regeneration offers significant advantages in reduction of the
              volume of secondary waste generated during target ion recovery.  The technology
              targets the recovery of bichromate from industrial process waste and hazardous
              waste sites.  The proposed technology will dramatically decrease disposal costs
              for chromium waste in the targeted industries. In this phase, synthesis and
              characterization of the proposed ion-exchange materials will be carried out
              utilizing established techniques. Preliminary evaluation of the proposed
              materials in the removal of bichromate will be performed for a variety of waste
              simulate compositions to establish selectivity, efficiency, and stability. 
              Electrochemical activation and regeneration of the proposed material will also
              be demonstrated prior to Phase II scale up and optimization.

The proposed
              ion-exchange resin will reduce raw materials and disposal costs for a number of
              industries currently using bichromate.  These industries include leather
              tanning, pigment production, wood preservatives production and metal treatment.
              The proposed technology is aimed toward waste reduction, resource recovery and
              toxic waste cleanup with a potential market of $60 million.
