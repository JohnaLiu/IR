Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a  novel
              electrochemical method of purification of "tail" gas, also known as vent or
              sniff gas.  About half of the chlorine produced in the chlor-alkali industry is
              liquefied, stored, and shipped.  The tail gas from the liquefaction process
              contains chlorine (Cl2) with oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide (CO2),
              and hyrogen (H2) as impurities.  Phase I involves reduction of Cl2 from the
              impure chlorine stream at a gas diffusion or porous flow-through type cathode. 
              The product HCl is anodically oxidized to generate chemically pure Cl2.  The
              other impurities in the impure Cl2 gas stream, e.g., N2, CO2, are either not
              reducible at the cathode or their reduction is too low to be significant.  The
              objective of Phase I is high current density.operation, delineating the effects
              of impurities in the chlorine on cathode performance, and minimizing the
              contribution of parasitic reactions at the anode.

Commercially relevant
              benefits include: material conservation (Cl2 is not wasted), reduction in
              energy consumption relative to other technologies, elimination of waste gas
              streams, and generation of pure Cl2.
