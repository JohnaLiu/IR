Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop processes
              and
products that effectively prevent corrosion of steel-reinforced concrete,
              and enhance the
interface and mechanical properties between the reinforcing
              steel and the concrete. A
tough and easily applied reinforcement coating would
              be relatively insensitive to damage
during transit and placement. Also, the
              improved mechanical interface with the cement
matrix would reduce the ability
              of moisture to migrate along the reinforcement, which
would increase the life
              cycle of the reinforced structures.                                            
                                                      This technology is expected to be
              robust and inexpensive and have potential commercial applications throughout
              the construction industries.
