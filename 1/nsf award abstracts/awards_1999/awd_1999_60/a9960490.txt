Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I Project will explore,
              demonstrate, and develop cost-effective designs and production technologies for
              semiconductor monolithic photovoltaic/photoelectrochemical (PV-PEC) devices for
              hydrogen production.  This work is motivated by the recent report of a 12.5%
              efficient laboratory device made by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition on a
              single-crystal GaAs substrate.  It is estimated that an order of magnitude cost
              reduction is necessary to make this technology economic.  This  approach is
              based on selective epitaxial growth of III-V compound semiconductors by simple
              closed-spaced vapor transport and solution growth processes on a large-grain
              polycrystalline silicon sheet material.   Cells based on heteroepitaxy of GaAs,
              InP, InGaP and GaN on polycrystalline silicon will be evaluated.  The simple
              structure of PV-PEC cells relative to other semiconductor devices such as
              transistors, photodiodes, lasers, and LEDs, makes the proposed selective
              epitaxy process especially advantageous in achieving high material quality at
              low cost with high-throughput processing.   This approach will yield the needed
              cost reductions without significantly sacrificing performance.

This is a
              moderate- to high-risk payoff project that seeks an economically viable, clean,
              renewable process for hydrogen generation.
