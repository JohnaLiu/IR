Abstract    :
              This project will explore a unique and ingenious use of solder to
              'self-assemble' two-dimensional surface micromachined Micro-Electro-Mechanical
              Systems (MEMS) structures into useful three-dimensional structures.  With this
              combined joining and assembly approach, surface tension forces in molten solder
              serve to assemble 3D MEMS structures.  A number of promising commercial
              applications have been identified. Most promising of these applications
              involves MEMS corner cube reflectors for communication and identification. 
              Current work on MEMS solder self-assembly has yet to provide the level of
              understanding needed to fully define the capabilities and limitations of the
              process.  Further studies of the fundamental issues are needed to understand
              these capabilities and limitations so that the process can be made commercially
              viable.  Key research personnel from industry and education and
              state-of-the-art equipment are in place. This project will develop the solder
              self-assembly process and contribute to engineering knowledge by answering the
              following questions:
 What are the performance limits of MEMS solder
              self-assembly?
 What are the commercial applications within these limits?
