Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I program will investigate the use
              of germanium tetrafluoride (GeF4) as an agent to fluorinate organic molecules.
              Preliminary experiments show that GeF4 possesses unique fluorinating properties
              as a direct fluorinating agent or in indirect use as a component of a catalyst
              system. The fluorinating ability of GeF4 can be employed, for example, in the
              manufacture of specialty chemicals, fluorocarbons from chlorinated
              intermediates, and fluorinated coatings for a variety of surfaces. 

When the
              full potential of GeF4 as a fluorinating agent is realized industries will gain
              significant economic benefits and an environmentally more benign fluorination
              process.
