Abstract    :
                  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project derives, designs,
              evaluates, tests, and produces forward error correcting codec chip sets. By
              introducing a modified BCH code into the Internet TCP structure without
              changing the TCP/IP format, it is feasible to achieve simultaneously: 95%
              throughput enhancement, 4-order bit error rate improvement, 80% effective delay
              reduction, transmission speed up to 10 Gbps, and channel utilization approaches
              unity Erlang.  Two decoding algorithms are to be investigated for large
              quantity production in terms of speed, correcting capability beyond theoretical
              limit, and complexity.  Computer programs will be generated and simulations
              will be performed.  Next, a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device will be
              selected, designed, evaluated, 'burned', and tested before VLSI implementation.
               The result meets the international standards for Asynchronous Transfer Mode,
              Internet, and satellite communications.

The proposed product is simple, low
              cost, and in need.  The applications range from ATM, Internet, and satellite
              communications.  The market share of ATMco for Internet alone is estimated at
              $750 Million over more than 5 years for a device to be priced at $25 per
              unit.
