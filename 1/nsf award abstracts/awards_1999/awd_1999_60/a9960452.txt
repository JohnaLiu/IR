Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will investigate the use
              of polymer surface engineering to enhance the adhesion and durability of hard
              coatings, such as TiN.  Hard coatings have the potential to improve a bulk
              polymer's biocompatibility as well as its wear and durability characteristics. 
              However, the severe requirements of the interface between the hard coating and
              the polymer caused by the dissimilar nature of the coating and the substrate
              promote coating delamination and flaking, especially when
coupled with
              exposure to aggressive external conditions.  The generally poor adhesion at the
              polymer/hard coating interface limits the long-term use of such structures and
              components in a number of applications, including biomedical implants. 
              Accordingly, DACCO SCI, INC., and The Johns Hopkins University propose to
              engineer the surface of the polymer and the deposited coating using several
              proce-dures (Ar+ plasma / sputter deposition, NH3+/N2+ plasma/sputter
              deposition, and Ti evaporation / N2+ ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD)).  By
              characterizing the surface/interface and measuring adhesion before and after
              accelerated durability tests, the mechanisms of adhesion can be established and
              the process improved to enhance adhesion and durability, tailored for specific
              applications.
