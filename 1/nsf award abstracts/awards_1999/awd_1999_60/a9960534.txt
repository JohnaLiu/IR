Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project involves the development
              of a catalyst to control NOx emissions from combined cycle power plants using
              natural gas fired turbines (natural gas fired power plants).   Guild Associates
              has developed an environmental catalyst for the control of nitrogen-containing
              compound emissions.  The catalyst is unique in that it is able to destroy this
              class of compounds, which includes NH3, without generating NOx.  The catalyst
              was recently investigated for its ability to reduce NOx in the presence of NH3
              in humid air.  Operating in the presence of excess NH3, the catalyst was able
              to completely reduce NOx without NH3 slip.  NH3 slip is prevented because the
              catalyst is able to directly reduce the excess NH3 to N2 and H2O.  The
              objective of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to evaluate this catalyst under
              conditions consistent with the natural gas fired power plant application and to
              modify the catalyst to address possible shortcomings.  Successful completion of
              this effort will lead to a simple, low cost technology for control of NOx
              emissions from natural gas fired power plants without NH3 slip.

Current
              technologies are not capable of reducing NOx emissions to greater than 90%
              without significant levels of NH3 slip.  Should the novel catalyst developed
              under this effort prove successful, power plants will be provided with low
              cost, simple technology to meet increasingly tighter NOx emissions levels.
