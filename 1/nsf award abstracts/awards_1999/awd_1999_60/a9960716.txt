Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop instrument
              control interfaces such as knobs and sliders with force feedback to create
              input-output devices capable of displaying feel to human operators. Flat-screen
              displays have significantly advanced the visual display of information in
              aircraft, automobile, and equipment interfaces. Similar advances for the sense
              of touch have not occurred - interfaces still use the same inflexible types of
              instrument controls (knobs, sliders, buttons, etc.) available decades ago.
              Exploration by the company suggests the potential for human factors benefits
              from advancing the state of the art in instrument controls by giving them
              programmable feels. Performance will benefit through the provision of
              meaningful, intuitive information to the underutilized sense of touch. These
              systems also could simplify interfaces by reducing the number of separate
              controls. One control could operate two or more carefully chosen functions,
              each function having a distinctly separate 'feel'. Instrument controls with
              programmable feels have the potential to revolutionize operator interfaces for
              all types of equipment and vehicles.

The proposed work will leverage
              technologies proven in the company's other touch display products. Further
              development will create cost-effective, manufacturable instrument controls with
              feel display. A huge potential market exists for vehicle interfaces,
              professional equipment, and consumer electronics.
