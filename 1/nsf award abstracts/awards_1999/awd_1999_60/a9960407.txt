Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase I program will test a novel physico/chemico method for preparing
              quality carbon products from unconventional resources.  The method consists of
              a preparation step in which particles are simultaneously treated to enhance
              separation which is carried out in the second step of the process.  A bench
              scale test reactor will be built for separation experiments and testing 
              ultra-fine particles.  The products will be characterized for major and minor
              metals and trace elements. The objective of this phase is to prepare feedstocks
              with impurity contents less than 1%.  The objective of Phase II will be to
              combine the two steps of the process into one and will prepare sufficient
              amounts of the material to test its potential as a substitute for petroleum
              coke and coal tar pitch in manufacture of carbon electrodes for use in electric
              furnaces.

The technology has the potential to prepare cost-effective
              alternative feedstocks for manufacture of carbon anodes and cathodes in
              electric furnace applications. The technology can also be applied other areas
              including production of refined titanium dioxide and graphite.
