Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I Project will develop a
              time-resolved high resolution scanning infrared microscope for applications in
              cellular biochemistry.  The microscope will be able to obtain images at
              sub-micrometer resolution in the mid-infrared with sub-picosecond time
              resolution and will offer capabilities not currently available from existing
              optical imaging techniques. Red blood cells will be used as a model system to
              demonstrate the ability of the new instrument to obtain infrared images at a
              resolution 200 nanometers at a wavelength of 5 micrometers over a variety of
              timescales.  The ability to study chemical and physical events in cells, with
              sub-cellular resolution, is important in understanding the molecular aspects of
              diseases and to the development of biomedical diagnostics and treatments. This
              instrument also has applications in semiconductor and polymer materials
              science.  Applications for advanced optical imaging techniques are 
growing in
              the biological and material sciences. Examples of commercial applications of
              this technique are imaging of chemical and structural events in cells and
              organs that are of interest to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,
              time-resolved imaging of carrier dynamics in semiconductors and photoconductive
              polymers, and imaging of chemically active nanostructures for advanced material
              design.
