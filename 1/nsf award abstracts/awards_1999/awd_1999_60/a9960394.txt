Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Cytel Software will
              develop a web-based 'Urn Sampler' that allows students to solve problems via
              the familiar probability mechanisms of drawing balls from an urn, throwing
              dice, drawing numbers from a list, and shuffling a deck of cards.  The Urn
              Sampler will present a low learning hurdle by using familiar symbols and
              standard tools: icons for sampling operations and a spreadsheet interface for
              data entry and calculations.  It will be embedded in and serve as the key
              component of a web-based authoring environment in which statistics teachers
              create, share and deliver lab exercises based on the Urn Sampler, as well as
              hyperlinked text, short video clips, self-assessment exams and frequently asked
              questions (FAQ's).  The intent is to create a statistics curriculum development
              'community' in much the same way that the open availability of the Linux
              operating system has created a community that contributes to further
              development of that system.  The Urn Sampler will address a diverse audience,
              including undergraduate and graduate students taking a required course in
              quantitative reasoning or statistics, students taking an undergraduate major or
              minor in statistics, graduate students studying statistics, and continuing
              education students.

Introductory statistics education has always been a
              problem area:  many students learn little from their required course and take a
              disliking to the subject.  By the same token, it is a commercial opportunity
              for a better product to target the market of statistics students-there are
              estimated 1,000,000 undergraduate statistics students per year with per student
              expenditures of $50 to $100 for books, software and other materials and thus a
              total market of over $50 million annually.  Cytel Software's
              resampling/simulation approach embodied in the Urn Sampler has a successful
              track record as a teaching strategy, and the web-based authoring and learning
              environment will allow sharing of the best and most innovative curricular
              materials.
