Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project applies novel 3D weaving
              and
cellular matrix technologies to develop a thin, lightweight composite
              structure for impact
absorption and body protection in sports. The first
              application will be to design and
fabricate a soccer shin guard which
              significantly decreases the risk of bone fracture due
to impact. The primary
              strategy for constructing superstrong fabric preforms will employ
a patented
              3D weaving technology in which fibers are interlaced in three axes without
              the
crimping or bending that occurs with traditional weaves or braids. The
              second strategy is
to significantly increase the strength and stiffness
              properties of the material per unit
weight by intentionally creating defined
              air voids throughout the composite structure
using a patented cellular matrix
              technology. In Aim 1, we will optimize the stiffness and
weight of different
              composite materials by varying the fiber, resin, total void fraction,
and
              fabric thickness. In Aim 2, we will use these novel, lightweight composite
              materials
to fabricate a variety of prototype soccer shin guards for
              maximization of player safety
and comfort. In Aim 3, the protective abilities
              of the newly designed shin guards will be
quantified and optimized via
              biomechanical impact testing.
