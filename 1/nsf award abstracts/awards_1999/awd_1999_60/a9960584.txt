Abstract    :
                        This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research Phase I aims to
              develop a near-infrared, laser-based spectroscopy instrument for detecting
              carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane in the Arctic as indicators of
              pollution transport. This instrument will be the first low-cost, remotely
              operated,
high-sensitivity, high-accuracy sensor capable of continuously
              obtaining, storing, and transmitting data without the need for on-site
              calibration. It will achieve a significant advance in the accuracy of CO
              measurements, thereby enhancing studies of pollution transport into the Arctic
              by allowing multi-year studies and comparisons between distant field sites. It
              will enable the atmospheric chemistry and Arctic climate scientific communities
              to generate accurate and reliable models of global pollution
              generation,
chemistry, and transport. 
          This instrument can be used
              as a medical diagnostic for pulmonary distress detection. It will also enable
              power plants and other industrial operations to improve the efficiency of their
              stacks, thereby decreasing emissions and increasing productivity.
