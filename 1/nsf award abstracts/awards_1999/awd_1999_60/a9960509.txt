This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
              project tests the feasibility of using polarized light scattering for
              characterization of nano-sized powder size and shape.  Nanostructures are a
              novel family of materials that allow customized structural, electrochemical,
              electrical, electronic, optical, magnetic, and chemical properties.  The
              development of nanomaterials into useful devices and products depends in large
              part on the ability to characterize these materials during synthesis,
              processing, and device  production.  Current characterization techniques are
              off-line, slow, expensive, and unreliable. Synergetic Technologies, Inc. (STI)
              will develop an innovative on-line, reliable, information-rich and real-time
              device.  A precursor of the proposed system has been successfully used to
              characterize agglomerates of nano-sized soot monomers from combustion
              processes.  Tasks include accuracy assessment and characterizing a variety of
              individual nanopowders and their agglomerates.   STI has consulted with two
              leading commercial innovators in the nanomaterials area: Triton Systems and
              Nanomaterials Research Corporation.  These companies have great interest in
              STI's technology and are eager to assist them in developing a system for
              on-line commercial use.

Phase I efforts will focus on proof-of-concept, with
              special emphasis directed at
characterizing the structure of nano-powder
              agglomerates.

Phase II will involve building and integrating a prototype
              unit
for on-line testing at a production facility.
