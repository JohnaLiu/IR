Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a
              revolutionary catalytic system for the production of Maleic Anhydride using
              shaped reticulated ceramic substrates.  Butane oxidation to Maleic Anhydride is
              a fast, exothermic reaction. Conventional extrudate catalysts suffer from
              severe diffusional limitations and poor bed heat-transfer leading to low
              product yields.  The major objective of Phase I research is to demonstrate the
              benefits of oxidation catalyst synthesized using this new substrate over
              conventional extrudate catalyst.  Other objectives of the Phase I research
              include quantifying the transport properties of the new substrate over
              packed-beds.  Catalysts for both conventional and novel systems will be
              synthesized and performance data obtained for a range of operating conditions.
              A combination of ultra-low pressure drop, high inter-phase transport rates and
              an extremely high effectiveness factor will allow this novel catalytic system
              to enhance catalyst activity and product selectivity over traditional
              packed-bed catalysts.  This will
lead to lower operating temperature and
              reduction in CO and CO2 formation.

Potential Commercial Applications:  It is
              expected that this new class of catalyst substrate will also enhance
              performance of other gas-phase selective oxidation reactions to produce
              important intermediates such as
Ethylene Oxide, Phthalic Anhydride and
              Acrylonitrile.
