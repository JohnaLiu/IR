Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I program will
              expand the types of thin film
ferroelectric materials for electrically tunable
              microwave device applications including resonators, filters, and phase
              shifters. Phase shifters play an essential role in phased array antennas, for
              example. As opposed to the conventional ferrite-based devices, which rely on
              magnetic fields to vary the magnetic permeability of the material,
              ferroelectric devices possess an electric permittivity or, correspondingly the
              dielectric constant, that is varied by an applied electric field. Electrical
              rather than magnetic tunability allows more compact and power-efficient
              devices. Thin film ferroelectrics have further advantages over bulk
              ferroelectrics in that they operate at lower voltages.  In this Phase I STTR
              project, F&S/Luna innovations and their university research partners will
              develop a new class of materials for electrically tunable microwave device
              applications that are based on organic polymers rather than ceramic
              ferroelectric materials. The advantages of polymers include low cost, easy
              processability, low dielectric constant and loss tangent, and the versatility
              of a wide range of potential materials that can be optimized for a given device
              through organic synthesis.

This technology would revolutionize the
              fabrication of microwave switching and phase shifting components by reducing
              size, cost and power requirements while improving performance compared to
              existing component technologies.
