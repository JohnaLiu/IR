Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an enabling
              technology for computer-directed high throughput screening of proteins for
              improved properties. By combining a fast computer screen with experimental
              methods, the capabilities of random library screening can be greatly extended.
              This technology will be tested on Bacillus circulans xylanase with the goal of
              improving its activity at high temperature and pH. Starting from the enzyme
              crystal structure, Xencor's proprietary protein design automation (PDA)
              technology will be used to computationally prescreen the possible sequences
              resulting from varying selected residue positions, thereby eliminating
              unfavorable sequences and thus enormously reducing the number to be screened
              experimentally. The result of the computer screen is an amino acid
              probability
distribution for the selected residue positions. A method will be
              developed to transform these probabilities into a DNA library that will be
              synthesized and experimentally screened for improved enzymatic activity. The
              computational prescreening will allow screening of ~10^80 sequences compared to
              10^10 to 10^15 with conventional in vitro evolution techniques. The proposed
              research will result in a generally applicable
procedure that allows
              optimization of far more residue positions and results in the more efficient
              development of improved proteins by coupling rational and random methods.
