Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
              fundamental computational improvement in Density Functional Theory that
              significantly extends the range of applicability of this method by removing the
              current computational bottleneck.  There is a significant opportunity for
              considerable advancement beyond current technology in the evaluation of density
              functional integrals.  Development of an improved technique for the treatment
              of the exchange-correlation terms, that significantly improves the computation
              time for molecules of all sizes, is the subject of this project.  The
              innovation is in creating a new formulation of density functional theory with
              auxiliary basis sets that is on a rigorous theoretical foundation, reducing the
              exchange-correlation cost by considerably more than an order of magnitude while
              also overcoming the drawbacks from which other treatments suffer.  These are
              attributes that no approach has been able to achieve simultaneously.

The
              potential applications of this new technology are broad-based.  QSI's primary
              intention is to incorporate this improved method into its educational software
              product, as an engine for a virtual chemistry laboratory.
