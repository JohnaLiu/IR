Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will develop
              nano-composite thin film materials and deposition methods for wear resistant
              coating applications.  Nano-composites have been reported with hardnesses
              exceeding that of diamond and are expected to be easier to produce than
              superlattices and other recent generations of tribological coatings.  The
              hardness and thermal stability of systems such as
molybdenum/titanium nitride
              will be modeled.  We will use reactive co-sputtering to synthesize these
              composites and their physical properties will be compared to calculated values.
              Cylindrical magnetron sputtering has been chosen for this work because of the
              ease of assembling targets with various material compositions and because of
              the advantages cylindrical magnetron sputtering offers for depositing onto the
              complex shapes that often require wear resistand coatings.  Wear resistant
              coatings are widely used on cutting and forming tools as well as in biomedical,
              aerospace, automotive and other applications.  The value of coatings on cutting
              tools presently exceeds $1billion annually and other uses are expected to reach
              $3 billion to $5 billion annually within a few years. Customers have readily
              adopted several new generations of materials and that trend suggests that
              nano-composites could capture a significant share of the market quickly.
