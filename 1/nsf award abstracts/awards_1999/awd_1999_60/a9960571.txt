Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research NSF Phase I project will demonstrate the
              potential of an 'On Demand Cocktail Creation System' that will significantly
              improve the MOCVD of complex thin film oxides, such as BaSrXTi1-XO3 (BST), PbZr
              XTi1-XO3 (PZT), SrBa2Ti2O9 (SBT), and Yba2Cu3O7-X (YBCO).  These films
              represent a rapidly maturing material technology for memory, sensor,
              electronic, and other important state of the art commercial and military
              product applications.  They are applied in the form of dielectrics,
              ferroelectrics, GMRs, pyroelectrics, piezoelectric, and superconductors, among
              others.  Presently, sputtering is used to manufacture such films; however, it
              is well accepted that MOCVD is the needed deposition technology for thin,
              conformal defect/damage free films.  MOCVD for complex oxides is limited by
              source chemistry and generally requires flash evaporation of chemical solutions
              (cocktails). COVA is presently leading the development of flash evaporation
              technologies with patented and developing designs.  We have found that the
              greatest limitation to application of cocktail chemistry for manufacturers is
              that of stable, repeatable 'cocktails'.  The individual chemicals are generally
              more stable than the created cocktails. We propose to make an 'On Demand
              Cocktail Creation System' operating in a controlled environment that will solve
              these and other problems.  We will do this in an oxide-CVD lab of a commercial
              systems vendor.
