Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase I project investigates the feasibility of a novel strain gauge
              sensing residual strains in composites formed during the manufacturing process.
              Many factors lead to these residual strains such as poor mold designs,
              inappropriate temperature and pressure settings, unbalanced ply lay-up, uneven
              shrinkage of matrix and/or expansion of the fibers and differences in
              coefficient of thermal expansion between tooling and composite. Residual
              strains hamper the quality of composites products; the measurement of these
              strains will yield improved process and quality control.  Quantum Magnetics is
              proposing a novel nondestructive strain sensor based on the principle of
              Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR). 1-5 wt% of crystalline additives is blended
              into the resin during fabrication of the composite structure. Composites will
              be manufactured with low and high residual strains via changes in manufacturing
              parameters and raw material variations. For measuring residual strains, the
              composite is irradiated with radio frequencies to evoke an NQR response from
              the embedded crystals, which is a function of strain.

The Phase I objectives
              are:  (1) determine relevant NQR characteristics of additive in composite, (2)
              investigate shift of the NQR frequency as a function of residual strain and (3)
              develop a preliminary design for a Phase II prototype.
