Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigates techniques
              and supporting mechanisms for visualizing enterprises. Understanding how
              enterprises operate is no simple endeavor. Many people who operate small
              businesses do so without the benefit of a formal education in information
              systems, organizational or process design. Similarly, people often lack the
              know-how needed to identify, diagnose and rectify problems in workflow,
              resource allocation, or business-to-business relationships. A survey, conducted
              by the firm, of related research indicates that little attention has been
              directed at understanding how to best visualize or visually represent
              organizational operations, structures, or processes. Thus, the basic problem
              for this research effort is, what constitutes an effective approach to visually
              represent the operations, structures and processes within an enterprise, or
              between interacting enterprises.  The project will investigate, prototype and
              demonstrate a new approach and supporting mechanisms for visualizing
              enterprises, starting with a computer game environment, through a two phase
              research effort. This is to be followed by a third phase of full-scale product
              development and commercialization.
