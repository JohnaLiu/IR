Abstract    :
              

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study the
              feasibility of building WEAVE (Workflows to Enable Agile Virtual Enterprises),
              an on-line service that allows any business to create and manage virtual
              enterprises using only an XML-enabled Web browser. WEAVE provides automated
              support to locate participating entities, negotiate for their services, plug
              them into an enterprise workflow using a graphical tool, and analyze the
              workflow for possible flaws. WEAVE manages these virtual enterprise workflows
              by dynamically choosing appropriate task schedules and supporting data
              interchange using XML document formats.  Thus, WEAVE enables businesses to
              easily set up virtual enterprises with little infrastructure and minimal
              start-up and maintenance costs.  This Phase 1 project will determine the
              operational specifications of WEAVE and ascertain its feasibility by
              prototyping its critical components.  Phase 2 will then produce a fully
              functional WEAVE system based on results from Phase 1. Finally, Phase 3 will
              make WEAVE commercially available to enterprises --- large and small ---
              thereby significantly lowering the barrier for participation in virtual
              enterprises.
