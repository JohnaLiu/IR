Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes the technical
              strategy of Blue Sky Batteries, Inc. for the development of unique
              nanocomposite cathodes for rechargeable lithium batteries.  These cathodes will
              enable commercialization of lithium ion cells which weigh forty times less than
              conventional lead acid and nickel-metal hydride cells, and three times less
              than the best lithium-ion cells now on the market.  Additionally, these cells
              will possess theoretical energy densities of 1500 Wh/kg and
capacities of 500
              Ah/kg.  This significant weight reduction and increased storage capacity will
              result in more compact energy supplies that will compliment, rather than
              burden, the current trends in electronics miniaturization.
