Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new
              interface paradigm, Digital Jigs, that makes 3D precision modeling in an
              immersive environment practical.  While immersive modeling has proven effective
              for freeform surface design, precision design has remained elusive to date.  In
              the proposed Digital Machine Shop, freeform tools such as cutting blades will
              be snapped to Digital Jigs to constrain their paths much as a carpenter's jigs
              guide physical tools. This paradigm supports familiar construction strategies
              rooted in the real world, thus encouraging traditionally non-technical experts
              to take advantage of digital methods.  To measure the practicality of this
              approach, test users will be asked to perform a series of precision tasks such
              as duplicating a variety of precision objects. Results will be evaluated and
              the system will be enhanced to make it more effective and complete at which
              time the software will be re-tested.  The results of this research will be a
              fully integrated freeform and precision modeling environment that is quick to
              learn and productive in its use. Target application areas are Industrial Design
              and Automotive Design.

Potential commercial Applications of the Research
              include Industrial Design, Automotive Design, Visual Design for Entertainment
              and the Fine Arts
