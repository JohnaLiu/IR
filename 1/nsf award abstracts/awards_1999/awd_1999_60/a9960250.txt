Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is designed to utilize
              the ferroelectric (FE) properties of alpha helical polypeptides for development
              of materials for use in tissue repair, especially nerve fiber outgrowths in
              vitro and in vivo. Esters of poly-L-glutamic acids (PRLG's) are known to
              display piezoelectric (PE) properties when aligned in magnetic or electric
              fields. The molecular conformation of the aligned dipoles suggested that the
              direction of the dipole vector in aligned films may be reversed by application
              of an electric field, thus giving rise to FE properties. Given our discovery of
              the FE behavior of poly-methyl-L-glutamic acid, this Phase I project will focus
              on establishing the feasibility of this biocompatible material to enhance
              tissue repair in vivo for potential clinical application to peripheral nerve
              regeneration.  Ferroelectrics find a number of applications: pyroelectric
              detectors, ultrasonic and electroacoustic transducers, and ultrasonic light
              modulators. The ease with which PRLG can be ordered in an externally applied
              electric field to create a film with strong dipole alignment suggests that it
              and other self-organizing and alignable biopolymers may also be suitable
              materials for development of FE materials for tissue regeneration.
