Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project describes the synthesis
              and consolidation of nanocrystalline yttrium iron garnet (YIG).  YIG is an
              important material for many high-technology devices.  YIG has been used
              extensively in the polycrystalline, single crystal, and thin film forms.  Its
              crystal structure is that of the garnet mineral Mn3Al2Si3O12.  Si and Mn are
              substituted by Y and Fe to obtain Y3Fe5O13.  YIG has the lowest resonance
              linewidth ever observed, and this property makes it commercially significant. 
              The presence of pores, nonmagnetic impurities and microstructural
              inhomogeneities broaden the resonance linewidth and deteriorate the properties.
               Nanoparticles have high coercive force and high saturation magnetization. 
              They also offer the ability to be consolidated into higher densities than
              micron sized powders.  Materials Modification, Inc. (MMI) proposes to
              synthesize nanosized powders of YIG and rapidly consolidate them using a Plasma
              Pressure Consolidation (P2C) technique into fully dense shapes.

YIG is
              applicable to high frequency microwave applications such as filters,
              oscillators, multipliers, detectors, resonance isolators and gyrators.
