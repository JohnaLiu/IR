Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Project will be directed toward
              assessing the performance of a new a front-end-of-line (FEOL) photoresist
              stripping process for electronic device manufacturing.  A Sulfuric acid and
              oxidant mixture (SOM) continues to be used for stripping photoresist from
              semiconductor wafers.  Recently, several groups of researchers have
              investigated the use of ozone dissolved in DI water (DIO) for photoresist
              stripping.  The use of ozone dissolved in water in lieu of SOM offers a number
              of advantages including:  1) decreased chemical disposal cost, 2) decreased
              rinse DI water consumption, 3) increased user safety, 4) decreased chemical
              cost.
Phifer Smith Corporation has developed a new process which has achieved
              an etch rate that is two to four times faster than the fastest DIO process.  We
              have defined four goals for phase I:  1) modify our existing wet processing
              test apparatus, 2) measure the etch rate for positive and negative I-line and
              DUV photoresist,
3) measure the etch rate for positive I-line and positive DUV
              photoresist ion implanted at dose levels of 1E13, 1E14, and 1E15, 4) develop a
              preliminary design for a (FEOL) wafer cleaning process for evaluation in phase
              II.
This process can be applied to high-speed photoresist stripping and post
              ash residue removal.  It may also find application in post-etch residue removal
              for front-end-of-line semiconductor manufacturing processes.  Finally, it may
              also find application in other industries as a residue free, environmentally
              benign, cleaning process.
