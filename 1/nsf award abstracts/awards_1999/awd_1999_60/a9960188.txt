Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will extend the photon
              energy range over which one performs ellipsometry to 9 eV, well beyond the
              current 'deep UV' systems which are limited to roughly 6.5 eV.  Specifically,
              an instrument operating over the entire 3 eV to 9 eV photon energy range using
              conventional laboratory light sources is envisioned.  This instrument would be
              used for material studies, at these higher energies, upon the wide band gap
              materials SiC and GaN, as well as some alternative dielectrics currently being
              developed.  In both cases, many of the critical points characterizing the band
              structure are inaccessible to conventional equipment.  We shall also emphasize
              studies of organic electronic materials, including issues such as void
              fraction, substrate dielectric dependence, and layer-dependent energy levels. 
              Furthermore, this project provides a potential instrumental solution to
              critical issues facing the semiconductor device industry.  It clearly meets the
              requirements identified in the National Technology Roadmap for gate dielectric
              metrology as being necessary but having no known solution.  It is also required
              by 157 nm excimer laser lithography programs, one of the candidate technologies
              for Next Generation Lithography.
