This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will assess the feasibility of producing glass colored by holographic
              elements.  There are very few colors currently used in construction glass
              because there is no method to color glass without distorting the color of the
              view through it.  A new method for producing aesthetically pleasing colors of
              glass is expected to foster a multi-million dollar industry.  To reach this
              end, a new holographic method to make images of a uniform field of color will
              be developed.  This property will differentiate the holographic product from
              most other current applications.  The color-producing holograms will be
              fragmented into small pieces, which can be mixed into liquid laminating resins.
               Resin will be used to laminate sheets of glass.  The color of the hologram
              will be visible when looking at the glass, however when looking through the
              glass, the view will not be colored.  Using standard holographic techniques,
              Phase I will optimize the appearance of the color and produce a small piece of
              laminated glass colored using this method.

The product will be a glass
              colorant with commercial applications in the construction/glazing industry,
              decorative trades, and automotive glass manufacture.  It also has potential
              applications in surface coatings for safety signs.
