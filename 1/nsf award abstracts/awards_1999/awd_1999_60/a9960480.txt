Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop
              methods for generating alignment of short but highly graphitic and inexpensive
              nanofibers in polymer matrix composites.  These efforts, carried out by Applied
              Sciences, in collaboration with its subcontractor, Ohio University, are
              expected to result in excellent mechanical reinforcement of the matrix, and
              effectively achieve the elusive goal of simultaneously attaining high modulus,
              high strength, and low cost from a carbon fiber reinforcement.  Carbon
              nanofibers will be made to align in thin, extruded strands of thermoplastic
              polymer that can then be laid up and molded into composites by conventional
              textile handling techniques.  The formation and lamination of papers from the
              short fibers will also be explored.  Composites will be tested for mechanical
              properties and evaluated for the degree of fiber alignment actually
              obtained.

A wide variety of military and commercial applications would
              benefit from carbon fiber reinforced composites.  Any application that
              currently uses chopped glass fiber reinforcement could be replaced by a carbon
              fiber reinforced component with improved mechanical properties.  Application
              that can benefit from added electrical conductivity in composites panels, such
              as low observable materials for aircraft, EMI control enclosures, and
              automotive panels that need electrostatic painting techniques.
