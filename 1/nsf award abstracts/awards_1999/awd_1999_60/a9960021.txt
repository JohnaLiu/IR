Abstract    :
              Cryopreservation permits the storage of larvae of the clam Mercenaria mercenaria
              for extended periods with negligible losses. The objectives of this Phase I
              research are: (1) To determine the efficacy of selected cryoprotectants in
              preserving trochophore and veliger larvae, and (2) to assess effective freezing
              and thawing rates of cryopreserved clam larvae. Techniques previously employed
              in cryopreservation of oyster spermatozoa, larvae of marine mussels, nematodes,
              and sea urchins will be screened.  Selected cryoprotectants and procedures will
              be applied to test survival and development competency of clam larvae.
              Effective cryopreservation methods will be further tested for applicability in
              commercial scale culture facilities.
