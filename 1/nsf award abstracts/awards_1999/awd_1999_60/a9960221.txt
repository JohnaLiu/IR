Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop improved
              dyes and dye-attached polymers for use in 193nm anti-reflective coatings
              (ARCs).  The recently revised National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors
              calls for the introduction of 193nm optical lithography as early as 2000-2001,
              with the initial goal being 0.15-micron resolution.  Due to high substrate
              reflectivity at this wavelength, there will be a definite need for an ARC
              underneath the 193nm resist.  Present generation 193nm ARCs exhibit poor plasma
              etch selectivity to photoresists leading to etch bias problems during
              fabrication.  The etch rate problems result from the high aromatic carbocyclic
              ring content and low heteroatom content of the dye-attached polymer component
              of the ARC.

In Phase I, prototype 193nm ARCs will be prepared from new
              dye-attached polymers that are enriched with electronegative heteroatoms, e.g.,
              oxygen and nitrogen, to enhance etch selectivity.  The resulting ARCs will be
              carefully characterized, including cured film optical density, plasma etch
              rate, and lithographic performance.  The objective of this NSF program (Phases
              I and II) is to develop at least one outstanding 193nm ARC meeting all industry
              requirements.  The ARC products to be developed in Phase II will fulfill a
              critical manufacturing need by enabling high yield production of integrated
              circuits operating at sub-0.15 micron design rules by optical lithography.
