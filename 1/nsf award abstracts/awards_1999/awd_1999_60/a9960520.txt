Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a
              novel, low-cost, infrared video camera.  Infrared imaging is a rapidly growing
              market valued at roughly $500 Million.  The proposed infrared camera is capable
              of meeting the requirements of commercial, military, and the R&D markets.  It
              has the potential to make infrared imaging as affordable as imaging in the
              visible.  Successful completion of this SBIR project is expected to lead to a
              $5,000 IR camera whereas the present cost of a similar system is close to
              $70,000.  The proposer's IR camera boasts ruggedness, high pixel count, and
              good temperature sensitivity. The goal is to demonstrate an 'uncooled', 1024 X
              1024 pixel camera with a temperature sensitivity of 0.2 K in a hand-held
              format.
        The proposed IR camera will find applications in the areas of
              process control, agriculture, machine vision, quality control, military, and
              R&D.
