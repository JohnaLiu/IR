Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project addresses the
              need for an instrumentation amplifier operating at high temperature for control
              applications. We propose to demonstrate an amplifier operating at temperatures
              above 400 degrees C by using transistors fabricated from a new wide bandgap
              semiconductor composed of Aluminum Gallium Nitride (AlGaN). SVT Associates has
              already demonstrated operation of transistors in this material system at 425
              degrees C. The Phase I effort seeks to demonstrate the key components of the
              integrated amplifier, namely the transistor, the resistor, and the capacitor.
              These components would be characterized as a function of temperature and used
              to fabricate a hybrid version of the first stage of the amplifier (a
              differential pair amplifier). The Phase II effort will involve the design,
              fabrication and testing of an instrumentation amplifier operating at 400
              degrees C. 
       The proposed amplifier could be combined with sensors
              operating in harsh, high temperature locations such as geothermal/oil wells,
              turbine engine control, avionics, industrial process control, nuclear reactor
              control, boiler combustion control systems, automotive underhood electronics
              and space based power systems.
