Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
              improved micro x-ray fluorescence instrument for thin film measurements. A new
              technique, monochromatic micro x-ray fluorescence (MMXRF) analysis using doubly
              curved crystal optics, can meet this significant market need. A toroidal
              crystal can focus characteristic x-rays from a microfocus x-ray source based
              upon diffraction. The focused beam is monochromatic and the beam size is
              expected to be significantly smaller than that of current MXRF systems. In this
              Phase I project, toroidal crystals for focusing Cu Ka1 and Mo Ka1 photons will
              be designed and fabricated using silicon and mica crystals. The reflection and
              focusing properties of the optics will be investigated and the feasibility of
              the MMXRF technique for critical semiconductor applications will be
              evaluated.
            This technique will provide high sensitivity and
              enhance excitation of low Z elements with the selection of beam energy. In
              addition, this technique will significantly increase the speed of high energy
              x-ray measurements. An MMXRF instrument is expected to provide process control
              in the metallization process of silicon wafers and chip packaging.
