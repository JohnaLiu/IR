Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will establish a novel
              diesel engine concept in combination with catalyst technology.  This will
              dramatically reduce diesel engine emissions while maintaining the enhanced fuel
              efficiency.  In this program we will demonstrate that the best features of
              spark engines (low emissions) and diesel engines (enhanced fuel efficiency) can
              be combined to produce a high fuel efficiency, low emissions diesel engine
              consistent with the 80 mpg goals of the Partnership For Next Generation Vehicle
              Program (PNGV).  The key to this program is the use of modest levels of oxygen
              enriched air (22-25% oxygen) to a diesel engine in combination with other after
              treatment procedures.  In Phase I we will demonstrate the needed enhancements
              from oxygen enriched air (OEA) and simulate overall system performance based on
              our after treatment model.  These results should demonstrate the engines
              ability to meet the PNGV mileage and emissions objective for passenger cars
              (hybrid vehicle) and/or meet the 2002 diesel engine emissions goal.  In Phase
              II we will integrate both OEA and after treatment systems into overall engine
              package for full scale demonstration.
