Abstract    :
                    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to building a
              very small form factor radio frequency antenna for radio frequency
              identification (RFID) applications in smart tags. HiPoint has invented and
              patented a high performance, low cost, small size silicon chip antenna using
              wafer batch processing that will be combined with a standard, passive
              (batteryless) RFID chip to form a low cost, high performance RFID tag with
              small dimensions. The antenna and the RFID chip are stacked directly on top of
              each other. Passive RFID systems are used in applications such as object
              tagging, asset management, hazardous materials tracking and tracking of
              important documents. The existing RFID technology is limited by the need for
              large transponder antennas (~ 1' x 2' minimum) and costly multi- component
              assembly. In Phase I proof-of-principle will be demonstrated by building an
              antenna chip and connecting and characterizing it with a standard RFID chip. 

                    Success in Phase I will lead to a Phase II effort where HiPoint will
              integrate the antenna and the RFID chip using a wafer stacking technology
              accessible to the company. The product will be commercialized in Phase III in
              collaboration with manufacturing and marketing partners.
