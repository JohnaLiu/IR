Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
              cost-effective technology to prepare full-length single-walled carbon nanotubes
              (s-l-SWNTs).  These SWNTs will be soluble in common organic solvents by the
              exfoliation and noncovalent functionalization of SWNT ropes.  We expect to
              develop a dissolution process that can be scaled up at low cost, thereby
              enabling commercial production of soluble full-length single-walled carbon
              nanotubes.  All of the currently known full-length SWNTs are insoluble in
              organic solvents.  While single-walled carbon nanotubes are recognized as the
              ultimate carbon fiber, the development of soluble full-length single-walled
              carbon nanotubes can provide the necessary processability for the preparation
              of homogeneous nanotube-based copolymers and polymer composites in the form of
              monoliths, fibers, films and coatings.  The development of these nanostructured
              materials is expected to enable applications in high temperature, high strength
              and light-weight structural materials for aircraft and space vehicles;
              electromagnetic radiation shielding coatings for military aircraft and ships;
              antistatic coatings for automobile; organic thin film devices for
              micro-electronics and -optoelectronics; thin film lithium batteries for space. 
              Soluble individual single-walled carbon nanotubes are versatile building blocks
              for functional nanostructures which may find important application in molecular
              electronics.
