Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the issue of
              fire as a major cause of injury, death and property loss estimated in the
              billions of dollars.  More than 85% of injuries are caused by smoke inhalation
              and mobility impairment caused by poor visibility  Many fire retardant (FR)
              additives reduce flammability, but do little to affect smoke generation.  Water
              releasing inorganic fillers can reduce smoke, but they must constitute 40% or
              more of the material to be effective.  This high inorganic content may be used
              in some plastics and rubbers, but it is unacceptably high for flexible foams,
              where the thin cellular structure cannot support or maintain such a high
              loading.  Unfortunately, flexible foams make up a major component of our
              household and office furnishings, and they are among the first items to ignite
              and propagate a fire.  TDA Research has developed a low-cost hybrid
              organic/inorganic nanocomposite FR agent for polyurethane foam; the hybrid
              additive provides fire resistance, and more importantly, reduces smoke
              generated during a fire.

Potential Commercial Applications of the
              Research
Applications for the hybrid FR agent include flexible foams for
              furniture cushions, beds, carpet backing, wall acoustic insulation and
              disposable packaging. Other uses include sporting goods, automotive padding and
              safety products.

Key Words
hybrid, nanocomposite, fire-resistant,
              smoke-suppressant, flexible foam.
