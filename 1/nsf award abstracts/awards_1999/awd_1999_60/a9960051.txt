Abstract    :
              The mission of BioLife Technologies (BLT) is to develop improved hypothermic
              (Cold storage at 4 - 10 degree C) and cryopreservation (-196 degree C)
              solutions designed to maintain human cells, tissues and organs in a near state
              of suspended animation. Data presented herein demonstrate that BLT's solutions,
              the HypoThermosol (HTS) series, are better at protecting kidney, heart and skin
              cells than is ViaSpan- a product produced by DuPont. BLT has launched an
              aggressive program to determine the molecular basis of cell death
              during
extended cryopreservation and hypothermic storage so that knowledge of
              these events can lead to a new generation of cryopreservation solutions. The
              Specific Aims of this Phase I project are designed to determine (1) which
              apoptotic inhibitors are best at protecting the engineered human epidermis,
              EpiDerm, during cryopreservation and hypothermic storage, (2) if upregulation
              of the cell death inhibiting protein bcl-2 can protect cells from
              cryopreservation and hypothermia-induced cell death, and (3) if cytochrome c,
              an apoptosis trigger, is released from mitochondria in human skin cells that
              have been preserved.  A higher risk Specific Aim is proposed to make
              cold-tolerant mutants from an E67-tranfected human keratinocyte cell line that
              can withstand hypothermia and/or cryopreservation regimes better than parental
              progenitors. Completion of the studies will allow BLT to establish itself as
              the leader in the preservation of engineered human cells and tissues.
