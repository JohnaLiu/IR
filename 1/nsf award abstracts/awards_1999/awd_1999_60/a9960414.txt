Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project aims to develop
              flexible, magnetic polymer composite coatings and free-standing forms having
              induced magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy using thermal spray technology. 
              There exists a need for a cost-effective method for efficiently making
              anisotropic magnetic structures less than 1mm in thickness as well as complex,
              geometric shapes, which cannot be achieved by an extrusion process. 
              Furthermore, there is a need to deposit flexible magnetic coatings onto a
              surface without the use of adhesives for sensor applications.  Poly Therm
              proposes to develop magnetic polymer powders using a mechanofusion process. 
              The powders will be injected through a combustion flame whereby the binder
              melts and the composite impacts a substrate to produce coatings or a release
              surface to produce free-standing forms.  The magnetic phase will also be
              dispersed in solution and injected externally into the flame during deposition
              for maximum magnetic phase content.  A magnetic field will orient the magnetic
              particles during deposition to create oriented magnetic structures.  The
              development of flexible magnetic thin films and complex 3D structures will open
              new markets for flexible magnets.  Coatings will be used for magnetic sensors
              and proprietary fasteners.  Automotive components, aerospace components,
              electromechanical devices, motors, actuators, magnetic fasteners, and magnetic
              recording devices will benefit from the development of such magnetic
              materials.
