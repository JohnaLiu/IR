Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study the spray
              atomization and mixing performance of effervescent (or aerated-liquid, or
              barbotage) atomizer in a subsonic crossflow environment, both experimentally
              and numerically.  The investigation of phenomena associated with the
              atomization of aerated-liquid jets injected into a subsonic crossflow poses
              significant challenges due to the complexity  involved among liquid, barbotage
              gas, and cross-stream air.  The research objectives are: 1) to identify the
              near-field spray breakup mechanisms, 2) to characterize the far-field spray
              structures, and 3) to explore the flow control capability of aerated-liquid
              injectors.  Extensive experimentation will be accomplished, allowing for
              complete characterization of atomization processes, including pulsed
              shadowgraph (for the global spray structure visualization and penetration
              height measurements), holography (for the near-field column structure studies),
              and PDPA (for the far-field spray structure measurements).  Flow control 
              capability of the aerated-liquid injectors in subsonic crossflows will be
              investigated in terms of the  discharge coefficients.  Numerical simulations
              will be performed using the KIVA computer code to predict the far-field  spray
              structures.  The application of aerated-liquid atomizers in subsonic crossflows
              is anticipated to offer  enhanced atomization and superior fuel-air mixing in a
              wide array of engines, such as gas turbine engines, rocket engines, and
              high-speed air-breathing engines.
