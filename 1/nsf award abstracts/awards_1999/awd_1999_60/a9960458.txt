Abstract    :
                    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project examines the
              potential for in situ characterization of fine particulate matter of combustion
              products using an innovative elliptically polarized light scattering method.
              Particle size, size distribution, and morphology are key factors that control
              the inhalation of air borne particulates. Synergetic Technologies, Inc. can
              determine these parameters via a unique approach based on customization of
              polarization settings for fine particulates. Unlike current on-line particle
              measuring techniques, structures of fibers and irregular shaped particles (such
              as particle agglomerates) can be determined with reasonable accuracy. The
              ability to discern such shapes will have a great impact on reliability of
              source and ambient monitoring efforts. This investigation will assess the
              feasibility of using the system to monitor particulate exhaust from small
              engines.  Fundamental research is proposed to closely examine the accuracy of
              the instrument (comparing results with electron micrographs) for a range of
              engine test conditions. Phase I will focus on evaluating system capability and
              accuracy. 
      In Phase II, a prototype system will be designed and
              constructed for measuring motor vehicle exhaust at the New York State
              Department of Environmental Conservation laboratories.
