Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will facilitate the
              development of gasoline and diesel fuel biodesulfurization (BDS). Recent
              domestic and international targets have been set to reduce the leads in fuel to
              less than 100 ppm (present regulations are over 300 ppm). Conventional
              hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is costly and works poorly at these low
              concentrations of sulfur. In this program we will develop stable non-wetting
              membrane contactors to provide bubbleless oxygen delivery to grow bacteria for
              BDS of gasoline and other fuels. Providing non-flammable oxygen delivery is
              major obstacle to commercial development of gasoline based BDS. Present oxygen
              delivery technologies introduce oxygen bubbles to fuel, but our membrane is
              hypothesized to dissolve oxygen directly into liquid. Also, unlike conventional
              microporous membranes,
our membranes should not wet out over time. This new
              technology, if successful, should help make BDS viable commercial alternative
              to HDS allowing gasoline producers to further reduce sulfur levels with low
              cost high quality process. In Phase I, we will demonstrate process using
              dibenzothiophene as surrogate fuel. We will measure rate of oxygen transfer and
              sulfur conversion. Economic analysis and durability testing will verify
              potential of process.
