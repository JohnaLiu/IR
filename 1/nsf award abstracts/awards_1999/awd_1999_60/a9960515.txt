Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will merge two recent
              breakthroughs in nanomaterials research to develop composites with an
              extraordinarily fine scale and unsurpassed homogeneity.  By combining the two
              technologies of melt forming of metastable nanoceramic solid solutions and
              Transformation Assisted Consolidation (TAC) of the resulting powders, we will
              be able to produce a new generation of nanocomposite materials.  These
              materials will be bulk samples that are fully dense and still retain the
              nanoscale grain size.  More importantly, the composite will consist of a
              homogeneous network of two ceramic phases, each of which retards the grain
              coarsening of the other and provides mechanical reinforcement.  The result will
              be a material that combines the advantages of composite structures with those
              of nanomaterials.

Materials developed in this project will be used for
              cutting and wear resistant applications such as tools and bearing components. 
              Many other applications exist such as engine components, seals, sensors,
              mirrors and situations requiring toughness and wear resistance.
