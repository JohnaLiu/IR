Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will establish the
              feasibility of a unique class of hydroxide-conducting, polymer solid
              electrolyte compositions.  These materials are referred to as Hydroxide
              Exchange Membranes (HEM), which exhibit high OH- conductivity (> 10-2 S/cm)
              while retaining good film forming properties and mechanical strength.  This
              material would be the first known hydroxide-conducting solid electrolyte.  In a
              preliminary study, Reveo has identified two possible means of synthesizing
              HEMs.   The focus of this study will be on evaluating these HEMs for their
              hydroxide conductivity, mechanical strength, and film-forming ability, as well
              as, optimizing the relationships between these parameters.

Cost-effective
              fabrication methods will be identified, and the effect of temperature on
              performance will be demonstarted.  Preliminary results indicate that these HEMs
              have great potential to fill a tremendous market need in the alkaline battery
              industry.  Since a competing hydroxide-conducting membrane technology does not
              currently exist, this material will have immediate applications in the alkaline
              battery industry.  It will further have applications and uses in the Reveo
              zinc-air Fuel Cell Battery and a hybrid class of hydrogen fuel cells.  This
              will remove the need for protection against corrosion or leakage of the liquid
              electrolyte and increasing the battery energy and power densities.  In
              particular, this material could dramatically reduce alkaline battery material
              and manufacturing costs while imparting environmentally-safe
              disposability.
