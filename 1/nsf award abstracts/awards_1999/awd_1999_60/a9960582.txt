Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from 3GCOM proposes
              specific algorithms suitable for application in Third Generation Code Division
              Multiple Access (CDMA) Networks, which couple the technique of re-transmission
              RAKE with power control in order to achieve high performance gains.  The R-RAKE
              protocol (which gets its name from the fact that it rakes-in energy from
              previous failed packet transmissions in decoding the current one) provides an
              increased received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).  3GCOM proposes specific
              methods for simulation, in order to optimize the algorithm's design and show
              the benefits of the proposed approach.  In addition, specific protocols are
              proposed to be studied, in order to provide a tradeoff analysis on the
              algorithm's implementation in the protocol layer of Third Generation systems,
              allowing for fast software product development during Phase II.  The firm will
              offer products that allow for optimized 3rd generation operation.  The products
              pertain to implementing algorithms in software to achieve this optimized system
              operation.

In the next so-called Third Generation of wireless cellular
              communications, high-speed, high-quality data services are dominant, but these
              services place very strong demands on the required power, and the network
              resources (capacity).  Therefore, protocols and algorithms to allow for more
              efficient high-speed data are necessary.  3GCOM proffers a technology with
              important potential to enhance data service quality in the US-based wireless
              industry.
