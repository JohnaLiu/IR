Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              fiber sensor system to be embedded in Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) during
              their fabrication. During use of the CMC component, a fiber failure could be
              unambiguously detected. The status of all CMC components could then be examined
              in real time by a system control hierarchy so that the applied load to the
              component can be reduced, or if that is not possible, the component could be
              replaced. Phase I will utilize electrically conductive elements of the load
              bearing fibers and sense the electrical continuity of these conductive elements
              to establish the mechanical integrity of the fiber. The sensing technology
              provides a clear, digital, on/off signal regarding the integrity of each and
              every fiber or strand. Because the concept is simple and direct, the method is
              expected to be highly reliable and sensitive.

Specific military and
              commercial use will potentially be found in: commercial engines for air and
              space, land-based radiant burners and heat exchangers, power generation and
              industrial gas turbine systems, hot gas filters for environmental applications,
              and high temperature industrial processing equipment and fixtures.
