Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will establish the
              feasibility to manufacture ultralarge thin sheets of ultraviolet (UV) polarizer
              films possessing excellent resistance to high operating temperatures and
              high-intensity UV radiation.  Although polarization of high-intensity UV light
              is a key component of several important industrial processes, currently
              available polarizing systems do not meet industrial requirements. Reveo's
              inorganic films will be manufactured in large thin sheets at low cost.  These
              films will operate at wavelengths as short as 110 nm, far shorter than standard
              polarizer films, and with adjustable bandwidth.
The technology may even enable
              polarization in the currently inaccessible far UV (85 - 125
nm) and extreme UV
              (50 - 90 nm) spectral ranges.  The films are based on Reveo's newly
invented
              polarizer fabrication technology that involves stacking of nano-structured
              layers
obtained by oblique vacuum deposition.  Previous research performed at
              Reveo has already demonstrated the viability of a similar technology in the
              visible region.  The superior material properties, achieved through
              understanding and control of the film nanostructure, will ensure that the
              proposed UV polarizers find immediate and wide applications in material
              processing, chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis, and microlithography.  As
              the first low-cost large-sheet polarizers with high efficiency, high damage
              threshold and high operating temperature, Reveo's inorganic UV polarizer films
              will be absolutely unique and find wide commercial application. The major
              markets for UV sheet polarizers are currently the liquid crystal display and
              optical components industries, but in future Reveo's UV polarizers could be the
              key enabling technology for low-cost chiral drug development, a huge and
              rapidly expanding market.
