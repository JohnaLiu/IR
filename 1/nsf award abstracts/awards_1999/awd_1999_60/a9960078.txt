This SBIR Phase I program
              will demonstrate the feasibility of prototyping and fabricating multilayer
              electronic components by the data driven microjet spray printing of
              multifunctional electrostatically self-assembled thin films.  The electrostatic
              self-assembly (ESA) process, licensed from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute,
              involves the consecutive formation of alternating, oppositely charged
              monolayers of metal and metal oxide nanoclusters, polymers and other molecules,
              at room temperature and pressure.  The electronic, optical, magnetic and
              mechanical properties of the multilayer films are determined by the nature of
              the molecules in each monolayer and the long-range order of the monolayers.  In
              this prototyping system, the operator inputs computer code and chemicals, and
              retrieves completed test articles for analysis.  During the Phase I program
              this work will be extended to demonstrate the feasibility of forming similar
              multilayer, multifunctional components by microjet spraying, and would analyze
              the molecular-level and macroscopic properties of the fabricated
              microcomponents. 
Data driven microjet spray ESA processing would allow the
              rapid design, synthesis and analysis of prototype electronic devices for
              communication, display, instrumentation and other electronics applications. 
              Microjet ESA-formed electronic devices with many-micron resolution would allow
              the low-cost, rapidly reconfigurable fabrication of electronic interconnects,
              circuit components, simple displays and sensors.
