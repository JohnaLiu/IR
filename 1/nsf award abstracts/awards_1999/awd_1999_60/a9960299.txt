Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes the
              development of an efficient, fast, and cost-effective photoreactor to supply
              pyrogen-free water on-line in hemodialysis systems. Several risks and hazards
              identified for hemodialysis are associated with water quality, including
              pyrogenic contamination. Current practices in hemodialysis systems do not
              guaranty pyrogen-free water. Furthermore, several drawbacks exist in current
              techniques: addition of chemicals, which have to be monitored and destroyed
              before
water contacts the dialysis membrane; formation of toxic by-products;
              no on-line supply of pyrogen-free water, and cost. In the proposed system, the
              disinfecting agents are produced in situ, consumed inside the photoreactor, and
              capable of complete mineralization of organic matter. Short treatment times
              will be achieved by incorporating an effective photocatalyst (inorganic,
              non-toxic, and chemically and biologically inert material) in an efficient
              reactor design. The aim of this Phase I is to evaluate the technical
              feasibility
of the novel photoreactor for on-line production of pyrogen-free
              water based on the construction and evaluation of a laboratory scale system.
              During the Phase II, an automatic system will be developed and integrated in a
              hemodialysis system.
     The proposed system will find immediate application
              in many sectors of the industry.  Pyrogen-free water is required in all
              hemodialysis systems. In addition, large quantities of pyrogen-free water are
              used by the medical industry such as in intravenous infusion fluids, fluids for
              infection and for irrigation in operating rooms. Also, sterile water is needed
              in the hydroponics industry.
