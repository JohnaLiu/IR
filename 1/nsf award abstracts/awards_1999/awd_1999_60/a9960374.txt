Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new material that combines good electronic and optical properties with
              excellent flexibility and elongation as an alternative to indium-tin oxide
              (ITO).  Current flat panel displays contain an optically transparent electrode
              usually made from ITO, which has acceptable conductivity and good transparency
              in the visible region, but has poor flexibility and durability and can not be
              processed in large films.  The new material contains both an elastomeric and a
              conducting component.  The conducting component is based on an intrinsically
              conducting transparent polymer.  Phase I will synthesize and characterize the
              new material, and then optimize its structure and formulation.  Phase I will
              also spin cast this polymeric material from water dispersion and characterize
              the properties of the resulting thin film.

Phase II is expected to cover the
              synthesis, development, and application of the new transparent conducting
              flexible material, which could replace ITO in displays and other electronic
              devices.  Transparent conducting materials with good mechanical properties
              could also be used as antistatic packaging materials for electronic components,
              and as electrostatic charge dissipation coatings for clean rooms.
