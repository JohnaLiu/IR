Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project poses an engineering
              solution to reduce workers compensation claims related to lifting. Back
              injuries account for approximately 20 percent of almost 2 million industrial
              injuries and illnesses each year, and 76 percent of injured workers have had no
              mechanical assistance in performing the damaging lift. Even when mechanical
              assistance devices are provided, workers are reluctant to use them because they
              are awkward, provide no feedback to the operator and reduce human dexterity and
              speed (i.e. commercially available lift devices slow the workers down). This
              project develops a human power amplifier module; an integrated system of
              pneumatic valves, an end-effector, and an embedded electronic adaptive
              controller, which can be fitted to a variety of commercially available
              pneumatic material handling devices. This intelligent module senses the
              worker's motions, while following the human motion exactly, it will amplify the
              human force for lifting objects without intermediary devices. This module
              preserves human hand-eye coordination while exerting high forces to maneuver
              heavy objects. If successful, it is expected that material handling devices
              equipped with the proposed module, when used by workers to maneuver loads, will
              greatly reduce the risk of injuries and the associated health care
              expenditures.
