Abstract    :
                          This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to
              develop the theoretical and practical bases for constructing a real-time,
              multiple camera, vision-based measurement system capable of providing accurate,
              three-dimensional measurements: (a) for verification of advanced modeling and
              simulation tools; and, (b) for remote, in-situ, non-destructive evaluation of
              both large and small structural components. The proposed research will focus on
              construction of a virtual test bed (VTB) for the vision-based measurement
              system. The VTB will include the processes of digital imaging, system
              calibration, image analysis for object measurement, and data synthesis for
              feature identification. We anticipate that results from the VTB development
              will identify promising concepts in each of these areas, which will be the
              focus of a Phase II program. 
            Potential applications of the
              proposed measurement system technology include: (a) remote non-destructive
              evaluation (NDE) of civilian infrastructure; and, (b) validation of advanced
              computational models for a wide range of complex systems (i.e., full-scale
              bridge systems, tank cars, aerospace vehicles) under quasi-static and impact
              loading. In addition, the measurement technology is readily integrated with
              other measurement devices (i.e., temperature, pressure, ultrasound, acoustic)
              for development of a multi-level evaluation system.
