Abstract    :
              The gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is the second most
              prevalent contaminant in groundwater in the United States, and there are
              currently no economical technologies for its removal from the water supply. 
              Envirogen scientists have recently isolated a novel bacterium (ENV 735) that
              utilizes MTBE as a growth substrate.  This is only the second report of a pure
              culture that is capable of growing on MTBE.  The objective of this Phase I
              Proposal is to evaluate the potential application of strain ENV 735 for in situ
              bioremediation of MTBE.  Aquifer microcosms will be used to measure the
              kinetics of MTBE degradation by ENV 735 under different microbiological and
              geochemical conditions.  In addition, the pathway of MTBE degradation by ENV
              735 will be studied, and experiments will be conducted to determine whether the
              metabolic capacity to degrade MTBE is shared among other bacteria of the same
              class as ENV 735.  The data from this study will be used to assess the
              feasibility of using ENV 735 and similar microorganisms for in situ remediation
              of MTBE in contaminated aquifers.

The commercial potential for a remediation
              technology that allows rapid, efficient, and cost effective destruction of MTBE
              in groundwater is tremendous.  This potential derives from the following
              factors:  (1) MTBE is the second most prevalent groundwater contaminant in the
              United States (e.g., 79 % of wells in urban Denver were recently found to be
              contaminated); (2) traditional technologies are ineffective at removing this
              contaminant from groundwater, and (3) MTBE has been shown to cause cancer in
              laboratory animals, thus regulatory concern is high.  Based on these factors,
              ENVIROGEN analysts expect MTBE to be one of the most active remediation markets
              over the next decade.
