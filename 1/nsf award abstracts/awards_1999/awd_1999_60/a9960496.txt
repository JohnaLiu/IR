Abstract    :
              This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project aims to research,
              develop, and demonstrate experimentally a novel cross-correlator chip and a
              high-speed multi-chip module package, the basic building blocks of an
              expandable cross-correlator system, with a frequency bandwidths of 2 GHz and
              priced at one tenth of the cost of existing cross-correlator systems with the
              same bandwidth. To achieve the stated goal, no single conventional technical
              approach could provide a cross-correlator chip operating at such high frequency
              bandwidth and at such a low cost -- only by synergistically combining
              innovative parallel architecture, bit-systolic arrays, novel digital circuit
              techniques, and deep sub-micron CMOS fabrication technologies can this
              unprecedented level of performance-to-cost ratio be obtained.  The correlator
              chip and the high-speed multi-chip module to be developed in this project, if
              successfully realized, will have the advantage of enabling the implementation
              of expandable cross-correlator systems that cost 10 to 20 times less than
              comparable systems envisioned for large interferometer arrays operating at
              millimeter and
sub-millimeter wavelengths.

The family of state of the art
              cross-correlator chips and multi-chip modules produced in this project will
              have applications in radio astronomy, earth science, geodesy and surveillance.
