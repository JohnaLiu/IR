Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is based on the
              development and
commercialization of Chiropticenes, a novel class of
              single-molecule chiroptical dipole switches.  Chiropticene molecular switches
              are triggered by a combination of light and electric field, which cause both
              the chirality and dipole direction to be reversed.  Information stored in the
              Chiropticenes is read nondestructively with circularly polarized light, which
              ensures erase-read-write capability.  The Chiropticene molecular switch is the
              fundamental component in CALMEC's nanotechnology-based optical data storage
              technology.
The objective of the Phase I research is to demonstrate the
              feasibility of the unique
Chiropticene switch.  Various organic Chiropticenes
              will be synthesized, characterized and
then 'switched' using a combination of
              electric field and light.  The completion of Phase
I will verify the switch
              mechanism and lead directly into Phase II, which is the
fabrication of a
              two-dimensional optical data storage device.
