Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project is designed to develop a
              biooxidation process module for low grade rhenium-bearing molybdenum ores and
              concentrates. Molybdenite (MoS2) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) are sulfides of
              molybdenum and copper, respectively. Rhenium (Re) is a rare metal that can
              substitute for molybdenum in the molybdenite crystal lattice and for which
              molybdenite is the only significant mineral source. These minerals frequently
              coexist in a given porphyry copper ore-body.
Currently, rhenium, of high value
              and with current and potential industrial applications, cannot be recovered
              unless the molybdenite is roasted. This process in itself is extremely capital
              intensive and results in SO2 production and other environmental impacts. Here,
              a novel process is proposed which is highly selective for sequential metal
              release. We describe a process module for biooxidizing copper sulfide
              contaminated molybdenite concentrates and selectively mobilizing copper or
              molybdenum and rhenium.

This process is designed to be integrated into a
              pre-existing chalcopyrite leach circuit  or as an independent biooxidation
              facility and will utilize molybdenite originating from  porphyry copper
              deposits. Variability in the grade of feed stocks should not be problematic. 
              The total annual domestic market is estimated at $60-200 million.
