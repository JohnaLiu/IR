Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project involves a systematic
              investigation of processing techniques to obtain high performance silicon
              nitride/silicon carbide nanocomposites ceramics.  It is expected that the
              innovative method of polymer precursor pyrolosis will allow lower consolidation
              temperatures and will consume less energy than conventional processes. 
              Additional benefits are expected to dramatically
increase the performance of
              the nanocomposites produced.  Expected process system benefits include broader
              commercial engineering applications due to lower processing costs and higher
              component reliabilities.

If processing costs can be reduced and high
              temperature performance can be enhanced potential commercial applications
              should be widespread.  At present, the following applications are envisioned:
              high temperature gas turbine components, continuous casting nozzle parts,
              cutting tools, high temperature welding and cutting tools, and high temperature
              nuclear fusion reactor parts.
