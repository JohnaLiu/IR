Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate major
              improvement in suction retention for transtibial (TT) prostheses.  True TT
              suction retention (i.e., intrasocket pressure below ambient) is rare because of
              sealing difficulty.  Fitting is arduous and expensive; stump volume changes
              diurnally, during illness and menstruation.  A TT socket that holds suction on
              donning, may lose it during the day.  The advent of Synergy's Smart Variable
              Geometry Socket (SVGS), now makes possible maintaining, automatically, a
              suction seal on the TT stump.  SVGS is simple, robust and relatively
              inexpensive; it enhances blood circulation and automatically prevents ischemia,
              protecting a stump with dysfunctional nerves from necrosis.  Project outcomes
              include greatly improved comfort, stability, sense of security and tissue
              health.  This project is necessary because TT body weight support is different
              from TF support, and a proximal, circumferential socket seal is needed. 
              Dynamic intrasocket pressures, ambulation work, endurance, speed and stability,
              and the amputee's sense of security will be measured.  Phase II will include
              broad clinical trials.  There are approximately 165,000 U.S. transtibial (TT)
              amputees, with 45,000 TT amputations annually.  Suction retention of TT
              prostheses should become popular with success of this project.  We project $10s
              millions/year worldwide sales of SVGS/TT socket-liners kits.
