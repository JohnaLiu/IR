Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will design and test a
              hybrid Raman spectrometer suitable for 'on-demand' or continuous process
              monitoring.  This will be accomplished by employing an innovative design that
              overcomes the limitations traditionally associated with Raman spectroscopy: 
              (1) long-term instrument stability, (2) fluorescence interference, (3)
              wavelength reproducibility, and (4) sensitivity.  A unique combination of
              components and internal diagnostics will allow greater than 1000 hours of
              unattended operation.  The instrument will be rugged, compact, low-maintenance,
              require minimum power, and as such, suitable for numerous industrial
              applications.  Phase I will demonstrate the ability of the proposed instrument
              to overcome all of the listed limitations.  The Phase I results will be used to
              build a prototype during Phase II suitable for customer testing in Phase
              III.

Raman spectroscopy is a very general technique and fiber optic probes
              will allow integration into a broad range of applications.  The long-term
              stability of the proposed Raman system would make it ideal for process
              monitoring and control in the following industries: chemical, petrochemical,
              polymer, composites, pharmaceutical, food processing, environmental and
              semiconductor industries.  It would also be ideal for health monitoring and
              fieldwork.
