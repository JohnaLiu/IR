Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
              multilayered ceramic impedance sensors for NOx monitoring in chemical and
              environmental applications.  Competitive sensors have several performance gaps
              that the proposed sensors may help overcome, namely - high costs, poor response
              times, poor stability, poor selectivity, poor reversibility, poor sensitivity,
              and fragility. During Phase I, Nanomaterials Research Corporation will
              establish the proof-of-concept that commercially desired, nano-engineered
              impedance sensors can be prepared and that the sensors offer significant
              performance
advantages. Phase II will optimize and produce packaged
              prototypes, while Phase III will commercialize the technology.  This effort may
              also help launch a whole family of sensors for low-cost chemical composition
              monitoring.
