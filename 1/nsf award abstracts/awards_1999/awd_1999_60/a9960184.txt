Abstract    :
              This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project is designed to improve
              the efficiency of low-cost multi-crystalline Silicon solar cells by enhancing
              their light absorption and improving their efficiency. Conventional geometrical
              texturing schemes are not applicable to multi-crystalline Silicon. We propose a
              maskless random nanoscale texturing technique using reactive ion etching
              techniques. This technique has been demonstrated to reduce absolute spectral
              reflection to less than one percent from the 350-1000 nm spectral region over ~
              130 cm2 areas. The nanoscale texture consists of 20-50-nm linewidth features,
              and enhanced absorption is based on a physical optics mechanism. 

The
              proposed research is aimed at optimization of nanoscale texture and surface
              passivation for optimized solar cell performance. Solar cells from these
              surfaces are expected to improve multi-crystalline Silicon efficiency.
              Potential applications also include Light Emitting Devices and field emission
              devices.
