Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project outlines a strategy to
              develop a family of photosensing polymers with low energy band gaps.  Such
              polymers will find application in the area of polymer image sensors and polymer
              photovoltaic cells.  Products that will utilize these polymers include large
              area flexible sensors for scanning.  The use of these sensors for office
              automation, industrial production controls and home electronics are a vast,
              untapped commercial market.
