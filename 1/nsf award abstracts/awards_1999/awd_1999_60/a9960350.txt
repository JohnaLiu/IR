Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed toward the
              development of a table-top x-ray microscope capable of 1 micron resolution at
              an x-ray energy of 30 keV. This resolution is approximately a factor of ten
              better than presently available devices using microfocus x-ray sources with
              magnification radiography. The proposed system is based on a novel x-ray
              detector capable of better resolution and higher Detector Quantum Efficiency
              than previously tried scintillators, such as particulate screens, dendritic
              Cesium Iodide, and fiber-optic-scintillator plates. If successful, the new
              device will be useful as a general purpose tool for nondestructive testing of
              materials, as well as biological and medical research
