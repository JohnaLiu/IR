Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel
              computational tool that totally avoids the generation of a discretization mesh
              in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations.  CFD is currently in use by
              a large number of industries to study fluid flow and heat transfer issues of a
              diverse number of process equipment. As computers keep becoming cheaper and
              powerful, the general trend in design will increasingly be towards simulation
              and away from experiments. The most time consuming step in the use of
              computational fluid dynamics for complex geometries is the generation of the
              grid on which the governing equations are to be discretized and solved. The
              grid generation step requires considerable human time in order to produce grids
              of acceptable quality from the viewpoint of solution accuracy and convergence. 
              This effort, will develop a novel computational tool that totally avoids the
              generation of a discretization mesh. Instead, the governing equations are
              satisfied at a large number of scattered points whose positions are generated
              either by a random number generator or adaptively as the flow field evolves
              during the computation. The scattered points are not connected to each other as
              in the finite-element and finite-volume methods, but are organized as "clouds."
              
If successful, the approach and software will considerably reduce the grid
              generation effort required for computation of industrial fluid flows.
