Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to design a new type
              of industrial continuous wave electron linear accelerator for electron-based
              irradiation in industrial, environmental, and medical applications. Our
              modular, cost effective, high-power accelerator is modular and can be made to
              produce an electron beam with energy between 0.6-6.0 MeV in 600 keV increments
              each with currents variable from 0 to 50 mA. In Phase I we will design,
              construct, and test our second section which will allow us to make 1.2 MeV/50
              mA/60 kW output electron beams. The product of this work will be an optimized
              design that will be summarized in engineering drawings from which we can
              construct a prototype 4.8 MeV/50 mA/240 kW industrial CW electron LINAC in a
              Phase II follow-on grant for the cold pasteurization of red meat.
