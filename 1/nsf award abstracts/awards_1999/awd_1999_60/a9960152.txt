Abstract    :
              

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              investigate the inventory allocation of revenue management (RM) systems.  As a
              new way of approaching the supply/demand concept, RM can be best understood as
              the set of actions leading to revenue maximization by efficiently utilizing the
              available perishable resources.  Phase I will: (i) devise a highly optimized
              dynamic inventory allocation algorithm that can be easily integrated in a more
              general RM framework; and (ii) build a prototype of decision making software
              implementing the algorithm.  The experimental policy will be based on a general
              RM model that encompasses the dynamic, stochastic, and network characteristics
              of the problem.  Phase I will use state-of-the-art mathematical (approximate
              dynamic programming and stochastic mathematical programming) and database
              tools.

Potential commercial applications of the work are expected in a
              diverse set of industries, ranging from the transportation and hospitality
              industries to telecommunications, health care, legal services, entertainment,
              and government organizations.  The new approach is expected to lead to 2%-3%
              improvements over state-of-the-art RM systems, and this will translate to
              considerable increases in revenue especially in highly competitive and highly
              constrained arenas.
