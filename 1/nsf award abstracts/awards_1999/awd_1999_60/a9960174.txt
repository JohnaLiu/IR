Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide the
              necessary precursor chemical kinetic and morphology optimization to produce
              thin films of yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) via an innovative, low-cost
              process called Pulsed-MOCVD.  The Pulsed-MOCVD system utilizes liquid injection
              of metalorganic precursor into a low pressure chemical vapor deposition
              reactor.  The problem is that deposition methods currently available to produce
              YSZ coatings with the required microstructure and properties are extremely
              expensive, highly polluting and energy intensive.  The objective of the
              research is to determine the best precursor and optimal deposition conditions
              to produce the desired YSZ film on the target substrates with via Pulsed-MOCVD.
               The research will utilize an existing experimental system to measure the
              growth rate and efficiency over the entire deposition range for three promising
              types of precursors.  The microstructure and crystallography of films grown
              under high-efficiency deposition conditions will be analyzed.  The experimental
              data together with kinetic modeling and analysis of the morphology will result
              in the design criteria for a commercial application of the innovative
              technology.

Potential applications of the results include the manufacture of
              corrosion resistant coatings, catalytic surfaces, solid oxide fuel cells
              (SOFCs) and thermal barrier coatings (TBCs).
