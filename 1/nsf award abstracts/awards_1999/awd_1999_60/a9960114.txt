Abstract    :
              Biogel Technology has been active in developing methods to modify the surface
              of
biodegradable microparticles and nanoparticles since 1993.  These
              nanoparticles, based on
poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLAGA) can be used to
              target drug delivery to specific
cell types in vivo.  While many techniques
              have been developed for larger scale production
on PLAGA microparticles, the
              preparation of submicron PLAGA particles containing an active agent poses
              serious challenges that are not necessarily present when preparing larger
              diameter microparticles.  No commercial-scale processes currently exist for
              preparation of biodegradable nanoparticles.  The scientific literature contains
              references to a number of preparation techniques, but almost all are on a very
              small laboratory scale.
This Phase I NSF SBIR Proposal describes our research
              plan for scaling up nanoparticle
preparation techniques.  We plan to expand
              our current processing techniques, which yield approximately 100 mg per batch,
              to a process that will yield 100 g of nanoparticles per batch.  These targeted
              delivery formulations are being studied for treatment of various types of
              cancers, as well as, acute blood clots.
Potential Commercial Applications of
              the Research
If successful, this technology will form the basis for commercial
              production of
biodegradable nanoparticles. No such techniques currently exist
              and are necessary before
products using targeted nanoparticles may be
              produced. The results of this project will
form the scientific and commercial
              basis to further develop a wide range of products,
including those to treat
              cancer and acute blood clots.
