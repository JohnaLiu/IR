Abstract    :
              The Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on development of
              platinum-transition metal binary catalysts supported on high area carbon for
              oxygen cathodes in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.  In order to reduce the
              bulk amount of platinum in the catalyst without losing activity and improve
              durability under fuel cell operating conditions, different combinations of
              platinum-iron/platinum-cobalt supported on nitrogen enriched carbon black will
              be prepared, characterized, and evaluated at T/J Technologies, Inc. 
              Performance evaluation of these materials as the oxygen reduction catalyst for
              fuel cells will be undertaken in parallel with thorough spectroscopic
              characterization to obtain structural and compositional parameters. 
              Correlation between activity and structural properties of the binary composite
              catalysts obtained in this research will be used for combining high catalytic
              activity with good stability in Phase II efforts.
