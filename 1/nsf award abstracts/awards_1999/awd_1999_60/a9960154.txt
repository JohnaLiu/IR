Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a
              sensitive, high throughput reporter gene assay by combining gel microdrop
              encapsulation technology and fluorescence activated cell sorting with a
              secreted enzyme capture and detection format.  Reporter gene assays are used to
              study eukaryotic gene expression essential for the development of higher
              organisms.  Although there have been significant developments in reporter gene
              assays, an assay which provides high sensitivity, high throughput and single
              cell resolution is still needed.  Frequently, gene products may be difficult to
              detect due to low abundance or instability.  In addition, many potential
              therapeutic molecules that modulate transcription, exhibit weak target binding
              affinities, resulting in low reporter gene expression.  The proposed assay will
              permit detection of a wide range of signal intensities from single, transfected
              cells which can be isolated for subsequent cloning.  Phase I studies will use a
              model system to identify agonists to nuclear hormone receptors, which are
              regulatory switches that control diverse cellular processes in higher
              eukaryotes.  The proposed assay will facilitate drug discovery by permitting
              rapid screening of combinatorial chemistry or natural product libraries against
              nuclear hormone receptors.

The proposed assay will provide a rapid, high
              throughput method for screening large libraries of compounds for potential
              therapeutic molecules.  Therapeutics is estimated to be a $100 billion market
              worldwide.
