Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes the design of a
              computer monitor that provides true three-dimensional (T3D) views of a scene. 
              T3D presents information over a volumetric space.   Such a system does not
              suffer from the loss of depth information, because of the projection of 3-D
              information onto a 2-D screen.  Since such a system is not available
              commercially, people often use stereo image-based pseudo 3-D display systems to
              satisfy the demand for visualizing information with increased realism.  The
              research objective for Phase I is to provide T3D views by distributing the
              contents of a 3-D scene over several planes-of-views, and optically projecting
              these planes-of-views onto a movable projection screen.  A novel scheme is used
              to synchronize the movement of the projection screen with plane-by-plane
              information generated on the CRT screen so that T3D views can be generated
              without flickers.  The use of these innovative concepts is anticipated to
              contribute effectively in designing a commercial quality T3D display system at
              a reasonable cost.  Thus, the proposed system is expected to find applications
              in the fields ranging from scientific visualization to entertainment.
