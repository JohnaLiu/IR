Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
              novel technique for the growth of CdGeAs2 single crystals based on Horizontal
              Zone Melting (HZM). CdGeAs2 has outstanding optical nonlinear properties,
              making it the best material for laser harmonic generation and tunable sources
              in the infrared.  However, CdGeAs2 crystals grown by Horizontal Gradient Freeze
              have substantial optically non-uniform areas, which limits their use. The
              smaller volume of the melt and the axial symmetry of the thermal field of the
              HZM technique are expected to produce crystals of improved compositional
              uniformity.

This project proposes to develop a growth technique based on HZM
              and apply it to the growth of CdGeAs2. CdGeAs2 single crystals will be grown
              and their optical transmission will be improved by irradiation with fast
              electrons.  The crystal uniformity will be characterized using x-ray,
              electrical and optical measurements.  Finally, HZM grown CdGeAs2 crystals of
              uniform composition and quality will be evaluated in an optical parametric
              oscillator to demonstrate tunable infrared radiation from 4 to 11 um.
