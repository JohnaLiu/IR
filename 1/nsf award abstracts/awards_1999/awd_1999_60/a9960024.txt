Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Naftware, Inc.
              addresses the need for better information search methods.  Recent advances in
              computational linguistics (event semantics) present opportunities for major
              productivity enhancements for American knowledge workers by enabling the
              development of ScenarioNet, which automatically learns to extract deep event
              information from text.  A major deficiency in current information extraction
              (IE) systems is that training examples must be painstakingly annotated by human
              experts.  In ScenarioNet, examples are automatically extracted, ranked, and
              kept or discarded in rapid user-feedback cycles, dramatically streamlining
              training the system for new or revised domains.  To enable a 'deeper' level of
              event information extraction, ScenarioNet incorporates a statistical full
              parser, event models, event builder (with sub-event merging), relationship
              models (extracting multiple relationships from a single phrase or sentence),
              scenario models, and scenario builder (with event merging algorithms).  For
              deep IE, events themselves must be placed in context of related events:
              ScenarioNet's hierarchical event and scenario models include representations of
              causal, temporal, and structural relationships.  Event merging algorithms
              utilize coreference resolution techniques, including discourse-level and
              cross-document coreference, to recognize multiple elements of events and how
              events combine into scenarios.  ScenarioNet eases cross-domain portability and
              enables deep event, relationship, and scenario information extraction.

A
              robust, easily customizable event, relationship, and scenario information
              extraction system has strong commercial potential in such industries as
              defense, intelligence, insurance (review of applications and claims),
              healthcare, financial services, legal services, business intelligence
              gathering, all levels of government (review of applications and reports) and
              engineering (to keep up with new developments). Naftware's proffered
              technology, ScenarioNet, removes the barriers to wide commercialization of IE
              by cutting the customization effort (cross-domain portability) and by
              incorporating deeper semantics into its object-oriented extraction models and
              templates.
