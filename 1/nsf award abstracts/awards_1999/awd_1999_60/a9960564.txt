Abstract    :
              Despite significant advances in materials in the past 30 years, breakthroughs in
              cutting tool materials for ferrous metals have been limited since the
              introduction of tuingsten-carbide cobalt (WC-Co) materials early in this
              century.  WC-Co is a compositional compromise between the hardness of the
              carbide phase, and the ductility of the (Co) Cobalt.  This compromise becomes a
              burden as industry continues to seek improved efficiencies, push the bounds on
              alloy properties, and develop new manufacturing practices.  In particular, the
              Co phase limits the usefulness of the tool due to loss of hardness at high
              temperatures.  Ceramic composites should technically provide the appropriate
              properties for improved cutting tools, and in fact, are used already in
              specific applications.  However, the available materials are either unreliable
              due to poor damage tolerance, or limited due to reactivity of with ferrous
              alloys.  A new ceramic material has been identified that exhibits significantly
              improved damage and corrosion tolerance.  We propose that a composite of this
              material with a hard carbide phase represents a revolutionary new concept for
              an essentially all-ceramic cutting tool.  The Phase I program will support
              composite preparation, characterization, and comparative machining evaluation
              alongside commercial WC-Co materials.  Phase II will support composite
              refinement, properties evaluation, and application development.
