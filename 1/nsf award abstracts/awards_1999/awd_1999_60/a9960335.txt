Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop catalysts
              to improve indoor air quality by the room temperature catalytic oxidation of
              pollutants. Initial focus will concentrate on the oxidation of formaldehyde. 
              Formaldehyde is classified as a probable human carcinogen and studies have
              shown it is present in many homes and businesses at levels exceeding
              recommendation levels.  Formaldehyde sources include many materials used in
              construction and furnishings, environmental tobacco smoke, and both indoor and
              outdoor combustion sources.  The ideal solution to indoor formaldehyde would be
              catalytic, room temperature aerobic oxidation to carbon dioxide and water.  TDA
              Research, Inc., in collaboration with the research group of Prof. Craig Hill at
              Emory University, proposes to develop polyoxometalate (POM) catalysts for
              formaldehyde oxidation.  The catalysts will be supported on fabrics, and could
              be included in draperies, upholstered furniture, and panels used in office
              cubicles.  Previous work has shown that fabric-supported POMs can catalyze the
              oxidation of several related compounds by O2 at ambient temperature.  The Phase
              I research to evaluate these catalysts will be aided by use of a
              high-throughput test apparatus, previously developed at TDA, which will allow
              us to test a large number of catalyst systems.

Because polyoxometalates are
              inexpensive and because room temperature catalysis requires no energy input, a
              successful project will lead to an simple system to improve indoor air quality.
              This system should find ready acceptance by manufacturers of many products used
              in both homes and businesses.
