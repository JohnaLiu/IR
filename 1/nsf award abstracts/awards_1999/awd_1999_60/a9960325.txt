Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is designed to discover
              improved transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) utilizing the combinatorial
              approach, and to develop an instrument capable of rapidly characterizing the
              TCO libraries.  TCO thin films simultaneously display the properties of high
              optical transparency (>90%) and near metallic conductivity that are important
              to many opto-electronic applications from photovoltaics to flat panel displays.
              Our three-phase plan is to use the combinatorial approach to identify the most
              promising combination of metal oxides, to determine the optimal oxygen doping
              of this compound, and then to develop a commercial-scale deposition process
              that can be used to manufacture millions of square feet of TCOs per month.
              

The research described in this proposal will have a significant impact on
              the productivity and efficiency of TCO manufacturers by providing materials of
              superior performance and an instrument capable of screening large libraries of
              opto-electronic materials and devices that will be commercialized for the
              testing of wafers, films, and devices on the production-scale.
