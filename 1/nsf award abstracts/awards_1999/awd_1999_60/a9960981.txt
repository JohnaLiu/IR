Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to perfect a method
              using
peptide aptamers expressed in plants that appears to work to control
              certain bacterial
plant pathogens in the genus Xanthomonas. The aptamers block
              function of critical
pathogenicity (Pth) proteins that are literally injected
              by the pathogens into plant
cells. The objectives are to 1) select better
              aptamers for capacity to block disease
development by screening for binding to
              predicted critical regions on the Pth protein and
2) create transgenic citrus
              plants that express the aptamers for later testing for
resistance to citrus
              canker disease. Phase II funding will be sought to produce and test
transgenic
              rice and common bean plants genetically engineered to produce the
              aptamers.
Three diseases of economic importance to the U.S. are likely to be
              controlled by this
novel genetic mechanism: citrus canker, common bean blight
              and rice blight. There are no
cures, no stable genetic resistance, nor even
              satisfactory controls for these diseases.
The citrus industry and state
              regulators consider canker control methods to be a top
priority. Localized
              losses of citrus, bean and rice due to these three diseases can be up
to 50%,
              20% and 100%, respectively. Applications to other diseases are likely by this
              new
gene engineering technology.
