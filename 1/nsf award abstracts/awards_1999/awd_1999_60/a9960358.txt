Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop particle
              measurement and control technologies for the thermal spray industry.  Thermal
              spray is a rapidly growing element of the metals processing industry, which
              needs process control.  Currently, there are no direct particle condition
              controls for lack of a sensor to provide real-time measurement of particle
              temperature and velocity.  A short-exposure imaging spectrometer will be
              developed for measuring and controlling the particle temperature and velocity
              in thermal sprays.  The innovation combines the technologies of imaging
              and
spectroscopy to capture particle data, critical to the coating quality. 
              The imaging field of view provides spatially resolved measurements in the
              direction across the particle stream.  With the development of the sensor, the
              system to control the particle stream conditions in a thermal spray will then
              be developed.  When particles are sprayed at optimized conditions over long
              production cycles, the coatings will be of the highest
quality and exhibit
              excellent bond integrity, strength and density.  Critical elements of the
              sensor will be modeled in a design study.  Prototype hardware and software will
              be constructed and an experiment to examine feasibility of the particle
              measurement and control will be performed in an industrial thermal spray
              facility.

Commercial Application The technology for measurement and control
              of particle conditions in thermal sprays has direct application to a wide range
              of manufacturing industries, autos, aerospace, energy and heavy equipment. Its
              use in the long production cycles, typical of these industries, will provide
              significant improvements in their productivity and competitiveness. Key Words
