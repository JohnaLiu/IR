Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves the development
              of a novel process for the low-temperature partial oxidation of hydrocarbons.
              The selectivity in a hydrocarbon partial oxidation reaction is determined by
              the balance between partial oxidation to the desired product, and complete
              oxidation to carbon dioxide and water.  The selectivity also decreases due to
              secondary oxidation of the partial oxidation product.  In this proposal, a
              novel process is described which simultaneously addresses these two issues. 
              During this Phase I program, ethylene epoxidation to ethylene oxide will be
              studied to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed process. 
              Silver catalysts will be prepared, characterized and tested for ethylene
              epoxidation in both fixed bed and novel bench-scale reactors. The main
              objective will be to demonstrate equivalent or better activity and selectivity
              for ethylene oxide formation in the novel reactor, relative to that of the
              fixed bed reactor.

The primary commercial application of the novel process
              to be developed is low temperature, hydrocarbon partial oxidation, where even
              incremental improvements in selectivity can translate into significant economic
              credits. It is anticipated that the process will be widely applicable within
              the specialty and diversified chemical industries.
