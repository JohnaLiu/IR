Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at developing a
              key technology-high conductivity, transparent anode electrode for high
              information density, large size, emissive polymer displays.  Flat-panel, liquid
              crystal displays are currently used for portable displays such as laptop
              computers, Personal Digital Assistants or Navigation Guiding Systems.  There
              are several drawbacks and limitations with LCDs (including limited view angle,
              limited contrast and relatively slow response speed).  Backlight is needed for
              LCDs to be used under weak light conditions.   Polymer emissive displays have
              emerged as promising technology for next generation displays with many novel
              features. Their processing advantages also allow them to be used for
              fabricating large area, light weight, emissive displays on flat, non-flat, or
              even flexible substrates.  This technology is currently limited for finite size
              and the limited number of pixels due to low surface conductivity of Indium Tin
              Oxide anode.

Success in developing a high conductivity, high effective
              transparency anode will allow the polymer Light Emitting Diodes to be used for
              large size, high information density displays.   Single pixel and model display
              devices will also be fabricated and characterized during Phase I.   Large area
              (3'-4'), high information density (1/4 VGA or higher), graphic displays will be
              developed in the Phase II based on the demands from market feedback.
