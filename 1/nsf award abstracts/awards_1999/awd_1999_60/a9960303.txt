Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project, if completed through
              Phase II, will result in a single integral motion sensor that will
              simultaneously measure velocities (or accelerations) along three orthogonal
              axes. These sensors will be a ground-breaking application of the proven
              molecular electronic technology (MET) employing a novel geometry, improved
              response properties, and a unique feedback system based charge and mass
              transfer phenomena. They will be low in power consumption, com-pact and
              extremely robust, have no moving parts, and, as a result of their total
              symmetry, will operate in any orientation.

These sensors should find
              immediate applications in: seismology, especially ocean bottom and borehole
              seismology; earthquake engineering; inertial navigation; industrial processing;
              and any application requiring measurement of velocity or acceleration. Their
              small size, robustness, and insensitivity to orientation make them especially
              attractive for field use.
