Stable isotope ratios can provide important constraints on the
              origins of the magmatic and volatile sources of igneous rocks and the
              differentiation processes by which they evolve.  However, traditional
              whole-rock isotopic measurements of glassy volcanic rocks may not reflect
              magmatic values because of modification during eruptive and post-eruptive
              degassing and alteration.  In contrast, analyses of phenocrysts provides an
              accurate and precise means of determining isotopic variations resulting from
              magmatic processes.  This Career research will examine variations in stable
              isotope compositions (18O/16O and D/H) of phenocrysts from subduction-related
              volcanic rocks, emphasizing (but not restricted to) intermediate lavas that
              provide information on the petrologic mass balance and shallow crustal
              degassing processes at calc-alkaline stratovolcanoes.  The proposed Research
              Plan involves two parts: (1) detailed study of oxygen isotope variations for
              magmatic products erupted at the Lassen volcanic center during individual
              eruptive cycles and over the prolonged magmatic history of the center and (2)
              study of hydrogen isotope compositions of hydrous phenocrysts in rocks from
              Lassen and Mount St. Helens.  The Education Plan involves three levels of
              instruction: 1) new course development; 2) traditional graduate student
              training, and 3) specialized undergraduate research training.  The new courses
              created will be a lower-division, service-learning course focusing on volcanic
              hazards in southwest Montana, and an upper-division course in isotope
              geochemistry.  The purpose of the undergraduate training program is to provide
              talented students, especially those planning on a research-oriented career,
              with one-on-one training in field, laboratory, and dissemination skills.
