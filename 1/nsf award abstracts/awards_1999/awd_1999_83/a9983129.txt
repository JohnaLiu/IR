Abstract

This research employs a
              genomics-based strategy to identify new transcription factors that help
              regulate the complex choice of blood-cell precursors that develop into T
              lymphocytes. The method allows candidate regulatory genes to be characterized
              even when classical genetic screens are impossible and the important regulatory
              target genes are unknown. The basic resources for the project are arrayed cDNA
              libraries from cells in the process of making this choice, prepared from the
              developmentally-arrested lymphocytes of mutant mice. These libraries are
              initially screened to identify clones likely to encode transcription factors. A
              broad screening method is then used that detects the presence of domains
              conserved in various transcription factor families, enabling members of over a
              score of different factor classes to be identified. The whole ensemble of
              putative transcription factor clones will then be characterized to determine
              their expression in the early choice points in T lymphocyte development. A
              subset of the clones with particularly interesting expression patterns will
              then be analyzed in detail for structure and for developmental regulation at a
              fine scale. Important tools used for this project will be the rich array of
              cell population markers for mouse lymphocytes and the availability of mutants
              that block the process at known points, allowing a stage-by- stage dissection
              of the T-cell developmental pathway. This system is a richly informative model
              for studying how the generation of particular cell types from multipotent
              precursors can be regulated.
