Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will demonstrate the
              technical and economic feasibility of the Slurry Carbonization process in
              generating an improved fuel product from low grade Municipal Sewage Sludge
              (MSS). Approximately 7.8 million dry tons of MSS are generated each year in the
              U.S. as a byproduct of municipal waste water treatment. MSS management is a
              growing concern due to the increase in generated volumes of sludge, demand for
              lower pollutant discharges, and rise in disposal costs. Slurry Carbonization is
              a moderate temperature and pressure treatment, which removes oxygen functional
              groups from the MSS and produces a homogeneous, carbon-hydrogen enriched char
              product for co-combustion or reburning in suspension-fired coal boilers.

The
              overall objective of Phase II research is to develop the scientific and
              engineering data necessary to design, build and operate a demonstration
              facility in Phase III scale-up. Phase II research will focus on bench-scale
              optimization using EnerTech's 2.2 gal/hr PDU and pilot-scale engineering
              studies using HTI's 510 lb/hr PDU. Pilot-scale combustion and reburning
              experiments then will be conducted in EER's 1.0 MM Btu/hr BSF. It is
              anticipated that Phase II research will establish Slurry Carbonization as an
              economically and environmentally desirable method of MSS utilization. In
              addition to treatment of MSS, other applications of EnerTech's Slurry
              Carbonization process technology include clean coal combustion and the
              production of homogeneous slurry fuels from industrial sludge, pulp and paper
              mill wastes, Kraft mill black liquor, MSW, RDF, wood wastes and other sources
              of renewable biomass.
