Abstract    :
              Brian Wladkowski of Western Maryland College, an RUI institution, is supported
              by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the Molecular
              Biophysics Program to explore enzyme-catalyzed reaction mechanisms using ab
              initio quantum chemical approaches.  The first goal of this research is to
              develop a comprehensive picture of the complete microscopic mechanism by which
              RNase functions to catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphodiesters.  The second goal
              is to develop, through comparison with available kinetic and structural data on
              RNase A, a generalized methodology for characterizing other enzyme mechanisms
              using this approach.  Once established, other related enzyme systems can be
              probed to make a priori quantitative predictions regarding site
              mutations.

Characterization of the microscopic mechanisms by which enzymes
              carry out their designed catalytic role is a central focus in modern
              enzymology.  Obtaining such detailed information is critical in predicting the
              behavior of enzymes and is essential for the design of new enzymes or
              modification of existing enzymes for specific catalytic tasks.  In recent
              times, computational techniques have played an increasingly important role in
              this endeavor.
