Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of alkenyl(aryl)iodanes as
              synthetic reagents.  The generation of high-energy primary vinyl cations and
              the use of alkenyl(aryl)iodonium and alkynyl(aryl)iodonium salts in
              nucleophilic substitution reactions will be explored.  New cyclic (benziodoxole
              or benziodoxolone) alkenyliodanes will also be prepared and the scope of
              utility for the reagents will be examined.  Revamping of the undergraduate
              laboratories and introduction of computer-based molecular modeling are two
              areas that will be enhanced by the award.

With this CAREER award,the Organic
              and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
              activities of Dr. Robert J. Hinkle of the Department of Chemistry at the
              College of William & Mary.   Professor Hinkle will focus his research on
              various aspects of hypervalent iodine chemistry with the goal of developing new
              synthetic reagents.  The educational foci of the project involve course
              development and undergraduate research.
