Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a high
              through-put drug screening technology based on the successful Phase I
              feasibility demonstration.  High throughput methods in parallel and
              combinatorial organic synthesis are revolutionizing the field of drug discovery
              and biological screening. However, progress is seriously impeded by lack of
              reliable methods for conducting high throughput chemical analysis (HTCA) for
              composition and purity assessment. Current approaches rely on liquid
              chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). With a cycle time of about 5 min, an
              LC/MS instrument can analyze about 300 samples in a 24 hr period.  We propose
              an innovative MS concept that reduces cycle time to about 10 sec, raising the
              potential analysis rate to >5,000 samples/day.  The innovation is based on a
              novel ionization source that achieves (1) near-universal and efficient
              ionization of drug compounds, (2) minimal fragmentation molecular ion spectra
              for accurate analysis, (3) minimal interference from air constituents and
              commonly used solvents, and (4) suppression of competition-for-charge and ion
              suppression effects experienced by conventional methods.  The proposed
              technology advances analytical and research capabilities to improve fundamental
              understanding of drug molecules and to build a knowledge base for implementing
              more rational approaches to lead drug optimization.

Market research
              indicates the potential for exponential growth on the basis of quick
              penetration of the chemical analysis niche of the rapidly growing field of
              combinatorial and parallel synthesis methods for drug discovery.  The proposed
              high throughput chemical analysis system has the potential to dominate the
              market for combinatorial library analysis, which is a rapidly growing field of
              drug discovery.  Our real-time, complex mixture analyzers will also be marketed
              for applications in drug testing, environmental monitoring, and on-line process
              monitoring.
