This
              project will work within the domain of maritime navigation, in partnership
              primarily with the Coast Guard, but with contacts to NOAA, NIMA, and the Navy. 
              The ontology developed will include such representations as shorelines,
              hazards, aids to navigation, tide tables, sea lanes, etc. and a related markup
              language.  This will be of benefit as these agencies begin to deploy web-based
              Q&A systems and automated mission planning, intelligent navigation aids, and
              route planning tools.  The research challenges in this work revolve around
              representing a domain that is highly dynamic, time-critical and rich in factors
              and entities.
