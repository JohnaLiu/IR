Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue the
              development of inherently low cost, mass-producable conductive composite
              materials and novel manufacturing processes for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane
              (PEM, also called Proton Exchange Membrane) fuel cells.  Current PEM fuel cell
              bipolar plates often achieve good overall technical performance, but have some
              combination of high materials, manufacturing and assembly cost.  This high cost
              is a barrier to market penetration of fuel cells.  In order to develop a fuel
              cellbipolar plate which has acceptable technical performance, as well as, low
              cost, novel composite materials amenable to low cost manufacture will be
              developed.  Three novel manufacturing processes identified during Phase I will
              be used to fabricate small and large format bipolar plates from composite
              materials identified in Phase I.  These bipolar plates will be tested for
              electrical conductivity and will be operated in both short-term,
              performance-oriented testing and longer-term, lifetime testing.  Additionally,
              the materials development work of Phase I will be continued in order to further
              optimize the novel composite materials for performance and cost. 

Successful
              completion of the project will lead to low cost, mass-manufacturable fuel cell
              stacks, thereby enhancing U.S. competitiveness in the emerging markets for fuel
              cells.  This will further lead to a greatly accelerated market penetration of
              fuel cells especially in low cost applications such as light duty vehicles.
