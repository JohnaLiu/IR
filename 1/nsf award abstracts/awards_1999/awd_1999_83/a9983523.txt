Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds upon the
              concepts developed in the Phase I grant to develop a clinical prototype of an
              optical mammography device that could be used for breast cancer screening or
              diagnosis.  The major technical obstacles to the development of an optical
              mammography device have been the need for imaging algorithms that are fast and
              accurate in the presence of scattered light, and for
developing measurement
              techniques that can collect enough photons in a safe and timely way to develop
              an accurate image.  Phase I demonstrated the technical feasibility of a new
              approach to the algorithms and hardware.  

The software objectives of this
              project involve testing an approach to compute inclusion absorption
              coefficients, modifying the software to directly locate inclusions without
              transformation and developing a 3-D and GUI interface.  Hardware objectives
              include developing a clinical prototype that would be safe and appropriate for
              imaging human subjects and calibrating and testing the hardware/software device
              on experimental data.
