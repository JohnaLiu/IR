Digital Government:
              Heterogeneous Reasoning Tools for Design Support

This is a planning grant
              proposal to explore the development and usefulness of software to support the
              solution of problems involving heterogeneous goals, representations, and
              rationales.  Such problems arise frequently in all information processing
              areas.  In this grant, the work will be focused on the design and
              administration of complex government statistical survey instruments.  The
              government partners are the Bureau of Census and the Bureau of Labor
              Statistics.  The work is expected to result in a larger and more encompassing
              proposal later.  The funding will support exchange of information relative to
              the agencies' missions. Exploration of the feasibility of deploying tools based
              on the Openproof framework, and identification of other government agencies and
              industrial partners who may be interested in collaboration
