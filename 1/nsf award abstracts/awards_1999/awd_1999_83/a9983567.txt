Abstract    :
              This project aims to better understand the relationship between
the response of
              the earliest nerve cells in the ear and the way that we
hear sounds.  The
              responses of these nerve cells can now be described
rather completely using
              computer models.  Therefore, we can ask whether
the absolute limits of how
              well we can hear the differences between two
slightly different sounds is a)
              limited by these nerve cells, or b)
limited by the way the brain processes
              their responses. We will then go on
to study the responses of the second level
              of nerve cells in the brain.
The responses of these cells tell us how the
              brain takes the first step
towards processing, and ultimately understanding,
              complex sounds. All of
our experiments start with simple sounds in a quiet
              background, but then
we go on to test our ideas with sounds that are presented
              in a noisy
background. Hearing sounds in a noisy environment is the most
              difficult
problem for the hard of hearing. A better understanding of exactly
              how the
brain extracts information from sounds and 'makes sense' of it will
              aid us
in the development of better hearing aids.
