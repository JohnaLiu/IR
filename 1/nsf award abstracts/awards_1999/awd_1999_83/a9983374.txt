Abstract    :
              This project deals with a new method of PVC smoke suppression and fire
              retardance, which involves the reductive coupling of the polymer chains by
              zero- or low-valent metals that are formed from metal compounds within the
              polymer matrix.  Specific objectives of the proposed research include a
              furtherance of the mechanistic understanding of reductive coupling chemistry as
              it applies to chlorinated polymers.  In addition, the synthesis of potential
              smoke suppressants will be undertaken and additives screened.  Ultimately,
              extension of the technologies developed herein to other commercial polymers
              will be pursued.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program supports the research of Professors William H. Starnes, Jr. and Robert
              D. Pike of the College of William and Mary.  Professor Starnes and Pike will
              apply their respective knowledge of polymer and organometallic chemistry to the
              problem of smoke and fire retardance in PVC plastics.  This is undertaken
              through the use of metal catalysts that will cause the coalescence of small,
              volatile molecules into larger, sooty particles under the conditions
              encountered during combustion.
