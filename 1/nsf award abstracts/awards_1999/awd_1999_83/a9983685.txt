Abstract    :
              This CAREER award provides funding to characterize the subtidal exchange
              hydrodynamics between estuaries and adjacent waters based upon the scale of the
              estuary opening and its bathymetry.  Results from this and other funded
              research will ultimately result in proposing a dynamical classification of
              estuary/ocean subtidal exchange processes.  In the educational portion of this
              proposal, the PI requests funding to develop and implement educational programs
              that integrate hands-on experiences into science courses geared toward
              undergraduate and high school students, and to integrate multimedia techniques
              into programs for high school students, teachers, and the general public.
