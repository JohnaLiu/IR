Digital Government: 
              Database Middleware for Distributed Ontologies in State and Federal Family and
              Social Services

One of the key problems in government at all levels is data
              interoperability.  The problem arises from the distributed nature of government
              agencies, the lack of top down leadership, and the remnants of  "silo"
              architectures seen in legacy mainframe agency information systems.  The
              explosive growth of the web has exposed this inability to integrate data and
              the consequent inability to ask sensible questions which cross agency lines;
              e.g., "what benefits can I expect from various government agencies when I
              retire."  Moving this distributed data to one place is not an option.  Rather,
              technology must be developed to access the data where it is held, using common
              data definitions, or ontologies and an interface.

This grant will support
              work on this problem in the areas of query infrastructure, middleware for the
              web,  and dynamic inter-ontology support.  The government collaborators are the
              Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, the Indiana Dept. of
              Workforce Development, and the US Dept. of Health and Human Services.
