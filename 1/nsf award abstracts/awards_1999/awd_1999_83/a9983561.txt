Abstract    :
              The research project  examines how female swordtail fishes assess multiple male
              traits when choosing a mate.  Female swordtail fish prefer vertical-bar pigment
              patterns that are symmetrical with many dark bars.  The various components of
              this pigment pattern on males can be manipulated to determine if females from
              different species (1) have different preferences for the bars that could
              explain differences in the bar pattern across species, (2) prefer males with
              symmetrical bars because they are in better condition, and (3) have stronger
              preferences for components that provide better information about male
              condition.  The educational plan is to develop an interactive Web page for
              Introduction to Zoology, increase opportunities for students to gain hands-on
              research experience, and expand collaborative interactions with Mexican
              colleagues where these fish are found.

One of the more important decisions
              any animal makes is deciding with whom it will mate.  Researchers are finding
              that, for a diverse group of organisms including humans, mate-choice decisions
              are based on multiple male traits, and yet we currently know very little about
              how multiple preferences interact.  This research project will provide a more
              realistic view of the process of mate choice, while the educational plan will
              increase the interest of students from Ohio and Mexico in research.
