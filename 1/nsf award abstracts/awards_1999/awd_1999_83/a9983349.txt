Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will test a
              novel sensor for real-time detection of trace impurities important in
              micoelectronics manufacturing.  Gas feedstock quality is an important
              measurement for any process control strategy because contamination at the
              part-per-billion (ppb) level may limit product yield.  This project's
              technique, called wavelength modulated photo-acoustic spectroscopy, has the
              potential to achieve these detection levels at a significantly lower cost than
              is possible with current technology.  This technology is compatible with both
              corrosive and non-corrosive gases. The Phase II will construct and field test a
              prototype trace moisture sensor that is expected to achieve 10-ppb detection
              limits in corrosive gases such as hydrogen chloride and ammonia.

Potential
              commercial applications are expected in on-line removal of trace impurities
              important in micoelectronics manufacturing.
