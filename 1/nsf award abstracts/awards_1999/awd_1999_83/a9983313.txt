Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a highly
              versatile fiber optics-based confocal system for biomedical applications. The
              proposed confocal fiber optics systems utilizes optical fiber technology to
              offer extreme compactness, multiple wavelength light excitation/detection (N X
              N coupling) minimal adjustment, and very low cost. One of the unique advantages
              of using optical fiber for confocal
microscopy is that both the entrance and
              exit pinholes are, in fact, the endface of the core of an optical fiber, which
              guarantees that the system will always remain in alignment. During Phase I of
              the project, we designed and developed two laboratory optical configurations:
              one for retrofitting regular upright microscopes, and one for high density
              microarray scanners, we then successfully demonstrated the feasibility of these
              optical
fiber confocal systems. 

In Phase II, we will expand the fiber and
              wavelength multiplexity, maximize photon efficiency, optimize the confocal
              fiber optical module, develop a biochip-based confocal fiber probe array, and
              characterize and test the systems by performing bioassays. IOS's fiber
              optics-based will provide confocal microscopes with a capability that will
              significantly reduce the cost of the system, increase the versatility of the
              wavelength selection, and increase the popularity of using the confocal effect
              for many different important applications.
