Abstract    :
              A common vision for a second level of national networking infrastructure is
              beginning to emerge.  This layer of services, among other things, is likely to
              incorporate support for users to securely and effectively access network-based
              resources at remote sites.  Before that can happen, however, the set of
              involved campuses will need to confront the issue of determining what the core
              set of interoperable middleware services needs to be. Perhaps more difficult is
              the related activity of defining campus policy to be enforced through the
              services. These services and the policies they enforce will need to permeate
              campus infrastructures, systems, and services.  This award provides funding to
              permit a set of "study" institutions to attack these problems by evaluating
              best practices for policy definition and deployment and then to create a plan
              for a multi-institution experiment in the instantiation and use of needed core
              services.  Results will help to inform NSF and others regarding programs
              designed to stimulate the emergence of this new logical network infrastructure.
