Intelligent Portable Antenna Systems for High-Speed
              Wireless Communication:
The wireless research and industrial communities agree
              that the
capabilities of portable units will constrain future high-speed
              wireless
system performance. In response to this challenge, Jennifer
              Bernhard's
research will develop intelligent portable antenna systems to
              improve the
reliability, throughput, and noise immunity of these
              networks.
Specifically, this project will implement new compact
              radiation-tunable
antenna with a performance-driven fuzzy controller on a
              portable unit.
This novel approach views portable antennas as dynamic
              components of the
communication system and will create an innovative paradigm
              for antenna
design and control.  A team-based research framework will
              require
undergraduate and graduate students to cooperate to achieve common
              research
goals.  Dissemination of research results will be coupled with
              outreach
activities to attract more women to electrical engineering.  The
              education
activities will focus on "active" teaching techniques for
              electromagnetics
curricula that use real-world problems to develop students'
              teamwork,
problem-solving, and technical communication skills.
