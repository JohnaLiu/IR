Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a symposium on recent advances in crustacean
              endocrinology.  The last symposium dedicated solely to crustacean endocrinology
              was held in 1983.  This symposium will be held at the annual meeting of the
              Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) in Atlanta, Georgia on
              January 4-8, 2000.  Twelve invited speakers will present the most current
              knowledge of the chemistry, heterogeneity, molecular biology, receptor biology,
              and function of crustacean neurosecretory and steroid hormones.  Invited
              speakers will relate this current state of the field of crustacean
              endocrinology with the pioneer work in crustacean endocrinology accomplished
              during the distinguished career of Dr. Milton Fingerman, Professor of Biology,
              Tulane University.  The year 2000 will mark the 50th anniversary of Dr.
              Fingerman's scientific career.  This symposium has been approved by the Society
              and has been accepted for publication in the American Zoologist (the official
              publication of SICB).
