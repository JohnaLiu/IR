Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a
              prototype instrument ready for field-testing. Phase I research demonstrated the
              feasibility of a radically simpler infrared gas sensor based on MEMS photonic
              bandgap structures. This instrument will sensitive enough to compete with water
              vapor measurements made by much larger, more complex equipment, but cheap
              enough to be treated as a 'throw-away' device.  Unlike current infrared
              instruments, assembled from many discrete components, it features a highly
              integrated 'sensor-on-a-chip' employing advanced surface modification
              technology
and semiconductor fabrication methods. This new, integrated
              approach replaces discrete-component instruments in much the same way
              integrated circuits have superseded distributed elements in electronic systems.
              In addition to the potential for atmospheric research applications, the
              proposed device is a stepping-stone to next-generation gas sensors for
              environmental and industrial monitoring.  The phase I project showed
              proof-of-concept while establishing sensitivity and signal-to-noise performance
              and developed drive circuits and other components to achieve necessary
              stability. Most important, this project achieved a breakthrough by
              demonstrating tunable, narrow-band, emission from a photonic bandgap surface
              structure.

The proposed device is a simple, low-cost, lightweight
              alternative to conventional infrared absorption instruments. By reducing
              weight, complexity, and cost, it opens applications beyond the reach of current
              infrared instruments. It is the first step towards next-generation gas sensors
              for indoor air quality, environmental research, and industrial controls.
