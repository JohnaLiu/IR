Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop new experimental techniques to
              produce controlled nanoscale patterns of biomolecules on polymer surfaces.  The
              specific goals of this project are to: (1) fabricate nanoscale patterns on
              polymer films using atomic force microscopy (AMF), (2) use molecular dynamics
              simulations of polymer-AMF tip interactions to predict conditions for desired
              pattern formation, and (3) demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating a
              biosensor by immobilizing biomolecules on the nanoscale patterned surfaces.
