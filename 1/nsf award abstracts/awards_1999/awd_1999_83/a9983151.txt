Evolutionary and conservation biologists study the geographic
              variation within a species with a new technique, a phylogeographic analysis, or
              a phylogeography. This technique combines estimates of genetic distances among
              populations with their geographic positions to better understand the historical
              relationships among the populations. Phylogeographic studies are commonly used
              in studies of animals, but rarely in plants. The low mutation rate of plant
              mitochondrial DNA minimizes the sequence variation needed for a phylogeography.
              The proposed research is a survey for sufficient mitochondrial and chloroplast
              DNA sequence variation to conduct phylogeographies of limber pine and ponderosa
              pine.

Conifers present an exciting opportunity for phylogeographic studies,
              for their mitochondria and chloroplasts have different patterns of inheritance
              and, consequently, drastically different potentials for dispersal. In the
              pines, the maternally inherited mtDNA has very low potential for dispersal,
              while the paternally inherited cpDNA has high potential for dispersal. The
              disparate potentials for gene flow are expected to produce dramatically
              different phylogeographies. The mitochondrial phylogeography should provide an
              indication of ancient historical events, such as isolation in glacial refugia.
              The chloroplast phylogeography should provide insights into the magnitude of
              pollen flow among populations today and in the recent past.
