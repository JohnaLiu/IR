Abstract    :
              The gap between the processor and memory speeds is a major bottleneck in today's
              computer systems. Increasing DRAM bandwidth and reducing access time are keys
              to solving the memory latency problem. There is a relative dearth of
              architecture studies on DRAM devices and systems; there are therefore many
              fundamental questions representing open research in the field. This project
              investigates into the effects of various techniques in designing a DRAM system.
              Examples include supporting concurrent accesses and determining the extent to
              which modern CPUs can exploit such support; the effect of multiple channels and
              whether they be ganged together to increase bandwidth or should they operate
              independently; and the effect of banking and its optimal degree for DSP and
              embedded applications.  For burst-mode DRAMs, the optimal burst size to
              accommodate both concurrency and fast end-to-end latency is analyzed in this
              project. The tradeoffs between the degrees of banking and interleaving, and
              between bus width and bus speed in power, performance, and cost are also
              analyzed. The educational plan involves developing a course on memory-systems
              design and optimization.
