Applying Universal Bases to Achieving Full Potential of

Summary

The goal of this interdisciplinary project is to establish
              the feasability of a more powerful and robust experimental system for the
              sequencing of DNA by hybridization. A conceptually novel approach is based on a
              new probe design and a new algorithm for sequence reconstruction which have
              been demonstrated by computational modeling to provide optimum information
              extraction in sequencing by hybridization. The probe pattern is based on a
              recent combinatorial result showing that the use of probes composed of natural
              bases and universal bases in a well defined periodic pattern is crucial for
              utilizing the full power of DNA hybridization chips. 

The successful
              implementation of this new method depends on the suitable performance of
              universal bases (wild cards), i.e., of natural or artificial bases with the
              capability of "hybridizing" with any of the standard nucleic acid bases, on
              chips. This method will be tested in chemical systems in order to discover
              optimum patterns in the context of non-ideal behavior of oligonucleotide
              probes. Specific activities for the proposed grant period are:

 1. A program
              of experiments with oligomers incorporating universal bases.
 2. Research on
              the synthesis of a new best suited universal base.
 3. Matching of sequence
              reconstruction procedures to developed models.
