TOPOGRAPHICAL LINKAGES BETWEEN
              NITROGEN AND ORGANIC CARBON SOLUTES WITHIN A FORESTED
              WATERSHED

Understanding how nutrients move through forested watersheds is
              important for determining the influences of natural processes and people.  New
              techniques will be used to study the fate of two important elements, carbon and
              nitrogen.  Interrelationships of these elements affect ecosystem productivity
              and the cycling of other elements.

Research will be done in a variety of
              landscape types (e.g., upland forests, wetlands and streams) which cycle carbon
              and nitrogen differently.  Since these zones are common throughout the
              northeast United States and southeast Canada, findings will have general
              application.  Results can be used in evaluating the effects of land usage and
              climatic change on carbon and nitrogen cycling.
