Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              new ceramic material, yttrium-aluminum garnet (YAG), for cutting tools used in
              the machining of titanium (Ti) alloys.  Phase I found it feasible to base a
              cutting tool on YAG, reinforced with silicon carbide (SiC) whiskers and TiC. 
              Phase II will further explore the use of YAG-based composites as a cutting tool
              for Ti alloys through: 1) optimization of compositions and fabrication
              parameters to obtain a fully dense composite with uniformly dispersed
              reinforcement phases; 2) evaluate the optimized composite relative to
              state-of-the-art materials in machining Ti alloys; and 3) identify wear and
              failure mechanisms by detailed microstructural characterization of YAG-based
              composite cutting tools, before and after machining tests.

Potential
              commercial applications are expected in titanium-alloy machining operations in
              the aircraft and aerospace industries.
