Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              sensor, actuator, and micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) products based on
              electrostatically self-assembled piezoelectric and electrostrictive polymer
              thin films.  Phase I found that an electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) process
              may be used to synthesize piezoelectric and electrostrictive materials with
              large transduction coefficients from a variety of dipolar molecular materials. 
              This indicates an ability to replace poled polymer and conventional ceramic
              transducer materials in numerous sensor and actuator devices and produce
              benefits in simplified processing, cost savings and improved performance.  In
              addition, the ability to select patterns and release portions of ESA-processed
              multilayer films allows the formation of MEMS structures, and thereby a new
              approach to surface micromachining.  Phase II will optimize the ESA synthesis
              process in manufacture of sensors, actuators, and MEMS products and demonstrate
              ESA thin-film based devices, including polymer MEMS.

New ESA-processed
              piezoelectric and electrostrictive thin film materials will have widespread
              potential commercial applications in sensor and actuator devices used for
              instrumentation and controls.
