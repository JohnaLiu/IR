Abstract    :
              	The magnetic dipole moments of short-lived radioisotopes near the proton
              drip-line will be measured to explore the limit at which protons and neutrons
              can be treated as identical particles in the bound nucleus.  The
              experiments
will be performed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron
              Laboratory at
Michigan State University.  The desired radioactive nuclei will
              be produced
using the fragmentation of intermediate-energy heavy-ion beams
              provided by the Coupled K500-K1200 Cyclotron Facility and selected from other
              species using the new A1900 fragment separator.  The method of nuclear magnetic
              resonance on beta-emitting nuclei will be employed to deduce the ground state
              magnetic moments of very light magnesium and silicon isotopes.  A method to
              directly measure the spin of the nuclear ground state will also be developed
              using
nuclear magnetic resonance and overtone spectroscopy.
	The
              state-of-the-art research facilities at the National Superconducting Cyclotron
              Laboratory provide a unique arena to advance the nuclear chemistry education of
              undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students.  The environment at the
              university-based cyclotron facility allows for a hands-on training experience
              for students at all levels.  To bring practical nuclear
science experience to
              the classroon, a new junior/senior level chemistry class will be developed at
              Michigan State University.  This course will provide students with a background
              in fundamental nuclear process and radiation detection
techniques.  Students
              will then apply this new knowledge to understand both cutting edge nuclear
              science research as well as current events having ties
to nuclear science.
