Abstract    :
                        This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              develop snaplock design concepts for composite materials, which is a novel and
              patentable joining and assembly technology.  Two snaplock connections were
              built in Phase I for testing, whereby application to a snaplocked and
              lightweight, tapered transmission pole was found feasible in both technical and
              economic terms. Phase II will design, build, and test a prototype 75-foot
              transmission pole, using pultrusion of two building-block profiles.  A tapered
              beam (or tube) of any desired length is obtained by performing secondary
              cutting, machining, and assembly, which are operations that can be automated.
              

          Potential commercial applications are seen chiefly in the $5
              billion international market for electric power transmission poles.  Additional
              applications are expected in highway sign bridges, intermodal shipping
              containers, housing, and tiltrotor aircraft.
