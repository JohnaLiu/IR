Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to design,
              implement and flight test an adaptive critic based flight control system using
              both the nonlinear and linear quadratic adaptive critic algorithms developed in
              Phase I; implement a hardware-in-loop test system for the adaptive critic
              flight control system; and flight test the adaptive critic flight conotrol
              system in Accurate Automation's LoFLYTE neurocontrol testbed aircraft.
