Abstract    :
              Abstract:

The Yale VIGRE program will build on the strong base of an existing
              inter-disciplinary and substantially vertically integrated program by creating
              vertically integrated project groups (VPGs) to carry out defined research and
              development agendas in pure and applied mathematics, curriculum development,
              education and outreach.  VIGRE at Yale will support undergraduates, graduate
              students and post-docs working together, with the guidance of faculty, for a
              diverse and flexible set of goals. It will provide undergraduates with a new
              range of opportunities to encounter mathematics in a more immediate and vital
              way than traditional coursework.  It will broaden and deepen graduate training,
              and provide for shortened length of study.  It will provide students and
              postdocs with opportunities to deepen their understanding of and expertise in
              teaching. It will develop and disseminate curricular materials for courses
              embodying new mathematical ideas, and new approaches to traditional topics. 
              

This program is being jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical
              Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities from the Directorate of
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
