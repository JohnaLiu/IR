Abstract    :
              This project involves an integrated career development plan centered around
              research in the area of self-assembly in water.  The research explores various
              aspects of self-assembly and molecular recognition, particularly those which
              mimic the many instances in nature where hydrophobic effects are found to
              effect functional molecular assemblies.  Specific aims include the synthesis of
              self-complimentary facially amphiphilic molecules as building blocks for
              self-assembly in water.  Recognition motifs will include facial amphiphiles as
              receptors for ammonium groups and lysine containing peptides, implicated in the
              emergence of vancomycin resistant bacteria.

With this CAREER Award, the
              Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Dynamics Program
              supports the research and educational activities of Professor Lyle D. Isaacs of
              the University of Maryland College Park.  Professor Isaacs seeks to understand
              how molecules in nature recognize each other and come together to form
              specific, functional aggregates.  This will be carried out by exploring the
              interactions of molecules in water, relying on water-repellent surfaces on
              these molecules placed in pre-determined locations.  The proliferation of
              on-line resources for chemical knowledge and the development of computational
              chemistry packages has changed the way in which chemists learn and do research.
               The educational plans will develop course modules in these areas, and
              integrate with the research goals through the development of supramolecular
              chemistry components for use in the classroom.
