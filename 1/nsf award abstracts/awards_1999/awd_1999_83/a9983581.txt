The objective of this project is to develop solid
              state NMR methods to characterize uniformly 13C, 15N labeled and selectively 2H
              labeled proteins using ubiquitin, BPTI, and margatoxin as model systems.  The
              goal is to establish reliable assignment methods to study uncharacterized
              membrane systems. High resolution, magic angle spinning techniques will be
              emphasized in the assignment protocol in order to allow confirmation of
              sidechain identity through isotropic carbon shifts, in analogy to solution NMR.
               It has been recently demonstrated that high-resolution multidimensional solid
              state NMR methods can be used to correlate backbone and sidechain 13C and 15N
              chemical shifts of hydrated micro-crystalline U-13C and 15N BPTI.   Methods for
              assignment will be optimized and developed for long range distance constraints
              and for dynamical constraints that are consistent with uniform labeling. 
              

The goal of this research is to further develop solid state nuclear
              magnetic resonance methods to study large and complex biological molecules. The
              present collection of characterized molecules is incomplete, and its particular
              blind spot is the fascinating proteins that rest at the perimeter of the cell,
              in its grease-containing membrane; here they supervise the communication and
              traffic between cells. Membrane proteins constitute 1/3 of the proteins of a
              cell, and yet only a handful of them are characterized.
