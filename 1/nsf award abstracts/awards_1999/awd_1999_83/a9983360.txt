Abstract    :
              Stephen Kukolich of the University of Arizona is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies of transition
              metal complexes.  The objectives are to determine structures and make
              measurements of quadrupole coupling constants and dipole moments for: (1)
              transition metal dihydrogen and dihydride complexes; (2) olefin-metal and
              cyclopentadienyl-metal complexes; (3) dinuclear transition metal complexes; (4)
              model compounds for reactions involved in olefin oxidation and possibly (5) a
              few organometallic radicals.  The studies will be carried out in a pulsed
              molecular beam using Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. They have the
              advantage over previously used X-ray techniques that they can locate the
              positions of hydrogen atoms in the molecules.  The data will be useful for
              testing theory, which requires gas phase data rather than that obtained in
              solution and is not well developed for this type of compound.

The studies
              will provide detailed information about the structures and properties of
              transition metal complexes.  These complexes represent an important branch of
              chemistry from a fundamental point of view and have important applications to
              the chemical industry as catalysts and in biological systems such as the active
              sites of enzymes and proteins in living systems.
