Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the
              resin/quartz crystal microbalance sensor technology demonstrated in Phase I. 
              The device revolutionizes current water monitoring methods by allowing
              continuous monitoring where only periodic sampling can now be performed.  In
              the Phase II project, ultra-pure water (UPW) monitors will be fabricated and
              analyzed at a university test facility as well as at a nuclear power plant and
              semiconductor facility. The monitor will be calibrated and a computerized model
              characterizing the device's performance in a UPW environment will be developed.
               The technology consists of applying ion exchange resins to a quartz crystal
              microbalance sensor device. Once manufacturing repeatability is achieved, the
              suite of detected contaminants will be broadened to include a wide range of
              toxic substances of interest to the federal government. Ultimately we expect to
              increase the monitor's capability to include all heavy metals set forth in the
              Clean Water and the Safe Drinking Water Acts.

Applications include the
              development of industrial process control monitors for ultra pure water
              applications such as semiconductor manufacturing, fail-safe devices to insure
              the continued effectiveness of drinking water filters, and continuous monitors
              to detect contaminants in EPA-regulated monitoring sites such as municipal
              water utilities and wastewater treatment plants.
