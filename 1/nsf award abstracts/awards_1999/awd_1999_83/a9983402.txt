Abstract    :
              This is a CAREER award to create a space physics research program for
              undergraduate physics and physics education majors at Southeastern Louisiana
              University.  The educational objective is to use the proposed research project
              as a vehicle to have the PI mentor undergraduate students as an adjunct to
              their regular course work.  The scientific objective is to combine data from
              the Sondrestrom Incoherent Scatter Radar and Super Dual Auroral Radar Network
              (SuperDARN) to measure the rate of magnetic reconnection between the
              interplanetary magnetic field and Earth's magnetosphere more accurately and
              over a larger magnetic local time than is possible using either instrument
              independently.  Through statistical analysis of the reconnection rate
              measurements before and after the onset of a large number of geomagnetic
              substorms, the investigators will test the hypothesis that substorms are often
              triggered by reductions in magnetospheric convection, which is driven by
              reconnection.  If the hypothesis is true, the project will develop criteria
              that will allow actual prediction of substorms. The funds will provide student
              stipends, both during the academic year and summer, so that students can travel
              to conduct research and attend scientific conferences to present results.
