Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              prototype two-wavelength
imaging pyrometer.  To monitor high-temperature
              materials processes, it uses an indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs)-based camera. 
              Two-wavelength imaging uses intensity ratios to provide accurate temperature
              measurement of objects with emissivity variation.  Single wavelength imaging
              sensors mistake absolute intensity changes, caused by emissivity variation, for
              temperature changes.  Temperature is a central parameter in many
              high-temperature materials processese.   Long production runs require
              temperature control for consistent product quality.  This thermal imaging
              sensor is expected to meet industry needs for accuracy, low temperature
              operation, and low cost.  Phase II will develop a 'research grade' imaging
              pyrometer for use in specialized laboratory experiments and a 'ruggedized
              grade' imaging pyrometer for testing in industrial facilities.

Potential
              commercial applications of the thermal imaging sensor (with its 1-2 mm
              sensitivity) are expected in industrial process control sensors for high
              temperature materials processing.
