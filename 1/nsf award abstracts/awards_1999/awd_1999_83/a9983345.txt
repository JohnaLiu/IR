Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in a
              demonstration of a self-triggered transient digitizer chip containing a flash
              analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and advanced triggering circuits.  The
              self-triggering circuit designed during Phase I will be improved such that an
              arbitrary delay can be imposed. This will enable parts of single-shot signals
              occurring before the triggering point to be captured. The advanced comparator
              work begun in Phase I will be completed in Phase II to result in
              an
error-correcting comparator with sub-picosecond accuracy. The resulting
              self-triggering transient digitizer chip will be able to trigger either by the
              signal itself, or an externally supplied trigger pulse. This generalization of
              our previous transient digitizer chip, together with the advanced architecture
              developed under other programs, will operate with greater than 10 GHz input
              bandwidth, and at a sampling rate of up to 20 GSa/s.

The Tektronix SCD-5000
              transient digitizer provided the highest bandwidth and performance of any
              digitizer based on an analog-to-digital converter. The removal of this product
              from the market provides a significant business opportunity. Potential
              customers from the National Ignition Facility and the Relativistic Heavy Ion
              Accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory have expressed interest in our
              potential product.
