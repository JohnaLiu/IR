Abstract    :
              One of the ways in which advanced network infrastructures are expected to be
              used in the future is to serve as the backplane for a distributed computational
              infrastructure. The notion of a national computational 
research grid is one
              of the models that has been proposed. This proposal is being funded in order to
              provide for planning workshops and small scale prototyping experiments that are
              intended to determine the requirements that applications expected to use such a
              grid might have. Results will be used to influence new projects and proposals
              for the construction of a full scale grid.
