Abstract    :
              Dr. Thomas Cundari of the University of Memphis is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program as an "NSF Scholar in
              Residence at NIH," to conduct research on developing rapid and approximate
              techniques for modeling transition elements as they exist in biological
              situations, and on validating such techniques in specific applications.
              Artifical intelligence techniques will be integrated with molecular mechanics
              and semiemperical quantum mechanics for rapid and reliable modeling of metals
              in biology in medicine.

Metal ions are critically important in many
              biological processes, including a large number that are highly significant in
              medicine. Currently available computer-modeling techniques are not readily
              applicable to dealing with species such as the technetium complexes that are
              important radiopharmaceuticals. This program combines the experience of the
              computer chemistry group at Memphis with that of the NIH Advanced Biomedical
              Computing Center to devise approximate computer-modeling methods that can be
              used by working scientists who are not full-time computer-chemistry
              specialists.
