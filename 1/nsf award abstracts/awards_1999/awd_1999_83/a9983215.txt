              Government:  A Language Modeling Approach to Metadata for Cross-Databse Linkage
              and Search


A crucial problem in government on-line services is that
              related information is often maintained in different systems across different
              agencies, thus making it difficult to integrate that information.  Most
              attempts at "one-stop shopping" sites in the government fail for that reason;
              they must be maintained manually which does not work over time.  On the other
              hand, data warehousing, where the data is cleaned, made conformant and housed
              in a central location, will not work due to the distributed nature of
              government-held information.

One promising avenue to approach this problem
              would be through the use of automated systems which generate metadata (data
              about data) for various datasets, allowing them to be integrated more easily,
              while the original data remains in place at its home site.  The work of this
              proposal will address this problem in a new way - language modeling.  The
              government collaborators are the US Geological Survey, the US Department of
              Commerce, the General Services Administration and the US Library of Congress.
