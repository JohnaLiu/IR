Digital Government: 
              Collecting and Using Geospatial Data in the Field:  An Extensible Framework and
              Testbed

This work will conceive, develop, and test an extensible framework
              to support the collection and use of geospatial data in the field.  Partner
              Federal agencies include the Bureau of the Census, the US Geological Survey,
              and several agencies of the US Department of Agriculture.

The proposed
              activities are designed to meet five key objectives:
1. Develop a model
              documenting and formalizing the infrastructure, tools, and key capabilities
              required to support a flexible and extensible field data collection system.
2.
              Conduct research on computer science tools and associated information
              technologies required to fully integrate digital geospatial data into the
              collection process.
3. Conduct research on infrastructure components that are
              needed to implement the system in a manner that limits the complexity of the
              system from the vantagepoint of the user in the field.
4. Investigate emerging
              field data collection technologies to determine how the usage of geospatial
              data is transformed by these new interfaces.
5. Explore the framework model
              and research developments in an application environment by developing prototype
              components and testbeds that correspond to agency data collection
              settings.

Six developments will be needed to address the research
              objectives:
1. a user-driven framework model,
2. a conceptual framework for
              conflation of heterogeneous geospatial data for field use,
3. a multi-agent
              system to support tools required to use and collect geospatial data in the
              field,
4. interoperable searching and discovery mechanism for prepared,
              existing, and potentially unknown sources of data,
5. object-oriented
              warehouse designs for the field data collection environment, and
6. 
              evaluations of emerging field technologies and their impact on user
              activities.
