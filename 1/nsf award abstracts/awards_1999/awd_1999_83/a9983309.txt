Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              physical modeling and model-based sensing and control techniques for chemical
              mechanical planarization (CMP) systems.  CMP is rapidly emerging as a global
              planarization technology for microelectronics fabrication.  Phase I found
              feasible modeling and real-time control techniques using actual experimental
              data from a commercial CMP system.  Three-dimensional (3D) results of contact
              mechanical models correlate closely with experimental results for removal rate
              distribution across a wafer.  Reduced input-output models relating the within
              wafer nonuniformity (WIWNU) to the pressure ratio and pad conditioning,
              obtained from detailed 3D models, were used as a basis for real-time and
              run-to-run control.  Phase II will extend these models and control methods and
              develop a model-based embedded controller for within-wafer and within-die
              uniformity control.  Phase II will culminate in tests of advanced process
              modeling and control software and an embedded controller for CMP
              systems.

Commercial applications in the semiconductor industry are expected
              to result in improved and repeatable performance, increased throughput, and
              improved yields.  An embedded controller product promises significant
              improvements in uniformity and throughput by allowing real-time control of
              uniformity for various CMP applications.  Process modeling software and control
              software have potential for significant improvements in the 'trial and error'
              approach currently employed in CMP.
