Abstract    :
              Choice behavior is usually studied by pitting known alternatives against each
              other; however, in nature new opportunities frequently appear.  Animals face
              the far more difficult problem of deciding between options of known vs. unknown
              value.  This study examines whether animals solve such problems by using a set
              of potential rules tied to regularities in the environment.  The study is
              carried out in a naturalistic foraging setting, where laboratory animals must
              choose between novel and familiar patches of buried food.  Conditions are
              arranged such that certain patterns of choices should emerge in some contexts,
              and quite different patterns in other contexts, if appropriate rules are
              triggered. 

Broadly, the project is aimed at determining if natural
              selection has shaped the decision-making processes of animals such that
              difficulties posed by uncertainty are minimized.  These decision processes are
              expected to reside in relatively simple cognitive mechanisms that cross species
              boundaries.  Advances in understanding choice behavior have wide applicability.
               Beyond furthering the understanding of animal behavior, the rules uncovered in
              this project may be useful to social scientists trying to predict
              consumer-buying patterns and to engineers designing adaptive systems.
