The biophysical techniques of equilibrium and stopped-flow CD
              and fluorescence (FL) spectroscopies will be used to characterize the stability
              and folding reactions of the histone proteins of the core nucleosome and the
              nucleosome itself.  The equilibrium and kinetic folding responses of variant
              forms of the core histones will determined with unmodified recombinant
              histones, truncated histones that lack the highly charged N-terminal tails or
              contain site-directed mutations that eliminate one or more basic residues from
              the tails, histones with specific acetylation patterns on the N-terminal tails,
              and histones containing mutational substitutions that mimic the effects of the
              ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes, whose activity is essential for
              gene regulation.  The stability and folding of these histones variants will be
              examined in isolation and in complex with specific DNA fragments, including in
              the intact nucleosome.

This research will permit a deeper understanding of
              the folding reactions of oligomeric proteins in general and provide insights
              into the assembly and stability of the nucleosome.  Of particular importance is
              the biophysical characterization of the effects of the regulatory alterations
              brought about by histone acetylation and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling
              complexes on histone and nucleosome structure and stability.  Detailed
              biochemical and biophysical analyses of the nucleosome and its component
              histones, in the presence and absence of these effectors, are essential to
              understanding the nature of these alterations and the role they play in DNA
              packaging and gene regulation.  The educational plan includes formal lectures
              on biophysics and protein folding in existing departmental courses, development
              of a techniques-oriented course on CD and fluorescence spectroscopies and their
              practical applications to biochemical experiments, including, but not limited
              to, protein folding, mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students in the
              PI's laboratory and in the department  with an emphasis on multi-disciplinary
              approaches to biological problems.
