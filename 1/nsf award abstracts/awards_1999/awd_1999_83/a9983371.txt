Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project provides an affordable
              means of electronically enhancing the nation's installed chalk, white, and
              drawing board base of 2.5 million units.  By adapting conventional writing
              surfaces rather than replacing them with expensive electronic white boards or
              graphics tablets, academic institutions, corporations, and governments could
              save approximately $10 billion in new equipment and installation costs. 
              CyberScan Technologies proposes to develop a retrofittable, low cost,
area
              adaptive product that can optically capture notes, drawings or sketches to a
              computer or to the Internet. CyberScan will refine the feasibility of
              digitizing hand strokes in real time that it demonstrated in Phase I using a
              small optical sensor and an optically transmitting pen or chalk holder.  
              CyberScan's objective is to convert written information on standard school
              chalk board surfaces of nine feet by four feet into electronic data suitable
              for display on a PC SVGA display screen and posting on Internet Web
              pages.

Potential commercial applications of the research include: CAD/CAM
              digitizers, low cost and portable electronic white board alternatives, video
              conferencing input devices, medical patient charting, and academic, corporate,
              military, and government interactive presentation devices.  Because of the
              serious interest of three potential marketing partners in the electronic white
              board field, rapid commercialization of products beyond
Phase II is extremely
              likely.
