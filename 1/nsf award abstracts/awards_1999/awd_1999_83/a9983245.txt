Abstract    :
              This grant provides funds to support an annual engineering design contest to be
              held in conjunction with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE)
              National Conference.  All members of SHPE student chapters will be eligible. 
              Students will work in teams of two to six to provide the design of a
              commercially marketable product that is a benefit to mankind and improves
              quality of life.  The design shall not be a duplicate of an existing product,
              but may be an enhancement of an existing product.  Ten finalists will represent
              their student chapters in a formal presentation run-off, and a winner will be
              selected by a panel of four to six judges.

It is expected that this activity
              will help to attract Hispanic students into engineering and to improve their
              retention rates.  It also will provide an interesting and useful experience to
              those who participate.
