Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              zinc-air fuel cell for replacement of internal combustion engines in polar and
              other cold climates.  Phase I examined the electrochemistry of the zinc-air
              fuel cell's anode, cathode, electrolyte, and system designs to identify and
              optimize critical low-temperature performance characteristics.  This power
              source has inherently high energy- and power-density as well as exceptional
              reliability at start-up temperatures as low as -40 degrees Centigrade.  Phase
              II will develop 500-watt prototypes, capable of internal and external
              recharging, for low-temperature, low-maintenance remote use.

Potential
              commercial applications include portable rechargeable power supplies, materials
              handling equipment, personal mobility vehicles, and cellular telephones
              operated in polar and other cold regions.
