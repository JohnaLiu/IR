Digital Government:  Defining a Motion Imagery R&D
              Program

This is an award to support a workshop to identify a research agenda
              in motion imagery as related to the infrastructure requirements of government
              (military and civilian) agencies.  National leaders in the use of motion
              imagery will be identified, white papers will be solicited, and the workshop
              will bring users and researchers together to develop recommendations for
              related R&D.  A final report will be written and published in hard copy and on
              the Web.  This workshop will be jointly supported by NSF and by the National
              Image and Mapping Agency
