Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              non-consumable and wettable titanium diboride (TiB2)-based cathodes with
              near-theoretical densities and purity.  Phase I demonstrated that titanium and
              boron powders could be reactively consolidated to produce near-theoretical
              density TiB2 parts using plasma pressure compaction.  A 4-inch diameter by
              3/8-inch thickness near-net shape cathode will be fabricated for evaluation in
              Phase II, and a novel water jet nozzle and abrasive jet mixer tube will be
              developed based on TiB2.  Phase II will also develop zirconium dioxide (ZrO2)-
              and titanium (Ti)-toughened titanium diboride composites for evaluation as
              cutting tools.

                    TiB2 electrodes are expected to provide
              better performance, cost-effectiveness, a hazard-free workplace, and
              environmentally benign processing in aluminum production; and it is now thought
              that rapidly consolidated, near net-shape TiB2 parts can also be used in
              cutting tools for hard metal machining, in mixing tubes for abrasive jets, and
              in nozzles for water jets.
