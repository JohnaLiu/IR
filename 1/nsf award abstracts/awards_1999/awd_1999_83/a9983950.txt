Abstract    :
              Internet attackers gain access to computers in two ways. The first way
is by
              monitoring and imitating the Internet activities of an authorized
user. There
              are well-known cryptographic algorithms that protect against
eavesdroppers,
              but today's cryptographic software is too slow to be
universally deployed. The
              second way is by locating and exploiting bugs
in communications software. The
              security community has been working for
years to find these bugs before the
              attackers do, but programmers are
adding bugs to security-critical software
              faster than security experts
can fix them.

This CAREER award project spans
              five areas: (1)
cryptographic algorithms fast enough to be used for all
              Internet
communications; (2) cryptographic protocols to protect specific
              Internet
services against espionage and sabotage; (3) educational tools to
              help
programmers learn how to write correct software; (4) tools to reduce
              the
amount of software in which bugs can produce security problems;
              (5)
secure replacements for widely used Internet servers that are
              habitually
plagued by security problems.
