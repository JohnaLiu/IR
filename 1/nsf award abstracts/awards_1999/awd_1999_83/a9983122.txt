Abstract

	Information contained in the temporal patterns of
              neuronal activity is fundamental to most forms of sensory processing, perhaps
              most notably speech. How is temporal information decoded by the nervous system?
              What are the neural mechanisms that permit neurons to develop selective
              responses to temporal patterns on the time scale of tens to hundreds of
              milliseconds?  The hypothesis guiding the current proposal is that local
              cortical networks are intrinsically capable of decoding temporal information. 
              Specifically, that short-term plasticity produces time-dependent changes in the
              balance of opposing excitatory and inhibitory events, and that these
              time-dependent changes in network state allow neurons to respond differentially
              to the distinct temporal features of stimuli.
	Neuronal responses to
              time-varying stimuli are determined not only by the strength of their
              excitatory inputs, but by a balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, each
              of which is modulated by short-term forms of plasticity.  The projects
              described here are aimed at understanding how multiple synaptic and cellular
              mechanisms interact, and the learning rules that govern the long-term
              plasticity of each process, including short-term plasticity itself.
	Together,
              these studies should contribute to the understanding of how the brain times
              events, as well as to understanding cognitive deficits that may involve
              temporal processing (such as some forms of dyslexia), and to the generation of
              artificial systems capable of complex pattern recognition.
