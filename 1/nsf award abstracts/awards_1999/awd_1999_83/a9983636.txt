This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER)
              grant funds a four year education and research program that investigates the
              dynamic impact of family background on child development using kinship models. 
              Traditional sociological approaches to assessing the impact of social forces on
              child health and development rely on a number of measured variables such as
              race, parental education, parental occupation and income as proxies for family
              background.  The projects will examine an alternate approach--investigating the
              impact of "background" through comparing the similarity in health and
              development outcomes among children from the same family, extended family, and
              community origin (i.e., siblings, cousins and neighbors, respectively). 
              Intra-family differences in developmental outcomes provide the counter-factual
              to processes of social stratification, so by understand the patterns that
              governs such differences, we can potentially better understand the process by
              which health and developmental inequality is transmitted across generations. 
              The study seeks to explore a number of related questions:  (1) what specific
              developmental risks tend to cluster within families and which are more
              individually specific?,  (2) why are the developmental outcomes of some sets of
              siblings, cousins or childhood neighbors relatively similar, while others
              demonstrate great health and developmental disparities?, (3) given such
              intra-family differences, how do family transitions lead to different outcomes
              for children reared in the same household?, (4) how do siblings affect each
              other's development?, (5) how well do our current measures of social economic
              status explain between family differences in child outcomes?, (6) does extended
              family and neighborhoods have an influence?, and (7) at what age is the family
              environment the most important for child development?

Data on developmental
              outcomes (i.e., physical health status, mental health, cognitive development
              and behavioral problems will be analyzed from the Panel Study of Income
              Dynamics Child Supplement, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
              Mother-Child linked data file, and the National Longitudinal Survey of
              Adolescent Health.

The educational component of this CAREER award includes
              developing two new courses, one graduate and one undergraduate.  The graduate
              course will merge the research being conducted in the teaching of quantitative
              methods to make advanced statistics less abstract and more accessible to
              student.  The undergraduate course will draw its material from the ongoing
              research funded by this grant.  That is, the course will present theories and
              data on the impact of family background on child development, educational
              success and adult socio-economic status.
