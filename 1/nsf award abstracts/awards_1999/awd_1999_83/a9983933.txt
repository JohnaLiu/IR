Abstract    :
              The zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer, the subject of this study,
              is the prototype flow for a vast number of technologically important devices
              (aircraft/ship/vehicle drag, industrial processes, etc.).  It will receive a
              "fresh look' in this research as the PI brings focus to a plausible and an
              evolving theoretical construct of the of the basic mechanics which are
              responsible for the important attributes of this ubiquitous flow field.  The
              experiments to be executed will also involve a significant perturbation: a
              moving belt as the wall boundary, that will dramatically alter the hypothesized
              source effect for the coherent motions in the flow.  

It is expected that
              this research will provide quite significant data and insight for this very
              important flow field.
