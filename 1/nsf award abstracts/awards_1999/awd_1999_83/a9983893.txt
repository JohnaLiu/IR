Abstract    :
              The proposal  entitled Nanostructured Surfaces and Materials aims to develop the
              chemistry and physics related to nanostructured surfaces and materials. A
              number of (nano) lithographic techniques will be demonstrated for generating
              nanostructured surfaces with well-defined interfacial properties to be used as
              model systems to investigate fundamental issues in surface chemistry and
              materials science such as wetting and dewetting, pinning of the contact line of
              a very small liquid drop,  the evaporation of an array of liquid drops as small
              as a  few femtoliters in volume, the nucleation and growth of crystalline
              materials in femtoliter reactors, and the chemistry of precipitation reactions
              confined to small liquid volumes. The integration of research with education
              will be aimed at the incorporation of materials science into the teaching of
              chemistry courses at both introductory and advanced levels, the introduction of
              materials related experiments into laboratory courses, the development of a new
              course on nanostructured materials for advanced undergraduate and graduate
              students,  and the inclusion of minorities, women, and persons with
              disabilities into the research programs.

These projects will have a very
              broad impact on the fundamental chemistry and physics basis needed for various
              emerging nanotechnologies. Technological applications that will benefit include
              the fabrication of ordered two-dimensional arrays of nanocrystalllites of
              metals, alloys, metal oxides, and semiconductors that can be employed as active
              components for new types of electrical, optical, electrooptical, magnetic,
              display, and information-storage devices. These high relevant areas will have a
              broad impact on new approaches to educating students that will be highly
              competitive for available jobs in the emerging global economy.
