Abstract    :
              This project focuses on developing efficient techniques for
              implementing
fault-tolerant distributed systems.  Even though checkpointing
              and
rollback recovery have been known  techniques for achieving
              fault-tolerance
in distributed systems, the intricacies involved in designing
              efficient
checkpointing and recovery protocols has been thoroughly addressed 
              and
understood only recently.  Based on this theoretical foundation,
(i) it
              is proposed to develop efficient checkpointing and
recovery techniques; (ii)
              implement  a simulation testbed for evaluating
the performance of the newly
              developed as well as existing checkpointing
and recovery techniques; (iii)
              integrate the findings
of our research as well as the existing research work
              on fault-tolerance in the
graduate curriculum. The important expected outcomes
              from this work are:
(i) an improved understanding of the issues involved   in
              building reliable
distributed systems; (ii) improved techniques for
              fault-tolerance in
distributed systems based on the hard experimental data as
              well as strong
theoretical foundation; (iii)  integration of the results of
              our research
in an advanced course in distributed systems which would 
              facilitate
the students not only  understand  the intricacies involved in
              building
reliable distributed systems but also help them acquire  the
              necessary
tools and techniques for building such systems.
