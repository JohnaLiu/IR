Abstract    :
              

        To grow, plant cells take up water so that the resulting
              internal
turgor pressure can push against the cell wall, causing it to
              stretch.
Water uptake depends on osmotic potential provided principally
              by
intracellular potassium (K+) ions, and potassium transport is therefore
              key
to plant cell growth.  A mutation in the gene encoding the AtKUP2
              potassium
transporter of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana causes the
              plants to
have small cells in the stem and leaves, probably because of a
              decrease in
potassium delivery to the shoot.  This grant takes three
              approaches to
understand the precise role of AtKUP2 in potassium movements
              within the
plant.  First, study of which cells turn on the gene encoding
              AtKUP2 will
reveal in which tissues AtKUP2 may mediate K+ uptake.  Second,
              examination
of the subcellular localization of AtKUP2 protein in these cells
              will
reveal whether the transporter is in the plasma membrane or in a
              membrane
of an internal storage vacuole, and whether the protein is
              asymmetrically
localized.  Third, studies of the kinetics of movements of
              rubidium ions
(Rb+, a convenient substitute for K+) in normal and mutant
              plants will
address where the putative block in potassium movement may be. 
              These
experiments will reveal whether the AtKUP2 transporter acts to take
              up
potassium in root or in shoot cells, and will lead to further studies of
              K+
nutrition and growth control.
