Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will 
              develop global frequency domain methods to analyze spectroscopic data from
              fluorescent probes. The project, led by Professor Sharon L. Neal of the
              University of Delaware, is being conducted in three overlapping phases. In the
              first phase, a model independent analysis approach that was previously
              developed by Dr. Neal is used to study the photokinetics of fluorescent probes
              that exhibit complex excited state behavior. The second phase uses phase one
              results to investigate the photokinetics of charge transfer probes bound to
              serum protein. The third phase studies  probe photokinetics of phospholipid
              vesicles and bicelles. When completed, this work will make a significant
              advance in fluorescent probe methodology by combining fluorescence techniques
              with the mathematical tools needed for data analysis. The result will  be of
              value to scientists using these probes in fields such as NMR and studies of
              biophysical processes.

This project will use a model-independent
              mathematical technique to develop useful information from fluorescence
              spectroscopy data. As a result, the information that is obtained from
              fluorescence probe studies of materials, such as polymers and proteins, will be
              significantly improved.
