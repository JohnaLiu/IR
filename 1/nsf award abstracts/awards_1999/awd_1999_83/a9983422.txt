Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will apply the
              ElectriMag (tm) concept to separation of unburned carbon from coal combustion
              fly ash.  A proprietary add-on reactor will be tested for separation of ammonia
              from fly ash particles at plants using catalytic nitrogen oxide separators. 
              The ElectriMag (tm) separator (patent pending) combines triboelectric forces
              with magnetic forces to allow the separation of particles which have similar
              magnetic properties but differing surface electrical charging  characteristics,
              or vice versa.  An alpha prototype built and tested in Phase I showed the
              feasibility of the concept.  A beta prototype will be designed, built, and
              tested on fly ash from coal fired power plants in Phase II; this model will
              incorporate changes suggested by the work of Phase I.  A conceptual level
              engineering evaluation will be done and a conceptual design of a 2000 Lb/Hr
              pilot unit will be made.

Potential commercial applications include
              separation of unburned carbon from fly ash, recovery of activated carbon from
              municipal incinerator fly ash, and dry coal cleaning.
