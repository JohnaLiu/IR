This grant continues the support of the PI's theoretical work
              on a variety of problems in materials with strongly correlated electrons
              arising from strong local interelectron interactions.  The research program
              consists of  related topics in heavy fermion materials (i.e., compounds based
              on cerium and uranium with anomalously large specific heats).  Part of the work
              is motivated by a new range of experiments that fine tune heavy fermion
              materials to a magnetic quantum critical point, with a goal of resolving
              whether local moments emerge at the quantum critical point or whether the
              transition is better described as a spin-density wave instability.
%%%
Many
              of the cerium and uranium based compounds have extraordinarily large specific
              heats, as if the electrons were a thousand times heavier.  Ever since the
              discovery of  these materials in mid-eighties, there has been a continuing 
              interest in the properties of these materials.  The PI has been active in
              theoretical work on these materials and related materials which have strongly
              correlated electronic effects arising from strong localized interactions
              between electrons.  This work has potential impact on a range of phenomena from
              superconducting to magnetic properties of these materials.
