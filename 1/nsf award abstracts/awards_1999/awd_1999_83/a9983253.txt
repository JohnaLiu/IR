Digital Government:  A
              Language Modeling Approach to Metadata for Cross-Database Linkage and
              Search

A crucial problem in government on-line services is that related
              information is often maintained in different systems across different agencies,
              thus making it difficult to integrate that information.  Most attempts at
              "one-stop shopping" sites in the government fail for that reason; they must be
              maintained manually which does not work over time.  On the other hand, data
              warehousing, where the data is cleaned, made conformant and housed in a central
              location, will not work due to the distributed nature of government-held
              information.

One promising avenue to approach this problem would be through
              the use of automated systems which generate metadata (data about data) for
              various datasets, allowing them to be integrated more easily, while the
              original data remains in place at its home site.  The work of this proposal
              will address this problem in a new way - language modeling.  The government
              collaborators are the US Geological Survey, the US Department of Commerce, the
              General Services Administration and the US Library of Congress.
