Abstract    :
              This project will develop a series of low-temperature topotactic synthetic
              strategies.  It will focus on (1) topotactic strategies to induce mixed valency
              in a variety of compounds, such as the perovskites, with ion exchangeable
              cations that can be made mixed valent or have their valency further manipulated
              by topotactic methods; (2) the assembly of known compounds of metal-anion
              arrays within perovskite hosts; (3) the synthesis of new host materials such as
              layered perovskites designed to exploit the proposed strategies; and (4) the
              development of new synthetic strategies.

The development of novel
              synthetic routes is important to the discovery of new classes of layered
              materials with superior properties that have impact on everyday activities in
              diverse areas such as health, energy, environment, and electronic and
              communications.  Furthermore, this area of fundamental science is an ideal
              training ground for educating future scientists and engineers.
