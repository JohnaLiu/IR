Abstract    :
              Abstract
Solidification occurs in many traditional and advanced materials
              processes. The quality of the materials and their electrical, magnetic and
              optical properties are determined by microstructure formation. An iterative
              experiment-theory-modeling research will be conducted for crystal growth in
              Bridgman systems. A methodology will be developed that can effectively control
              the materials morphology and microstructure during eutectic solidification
              utilizing combined electric and magnetic fields. A virtual laboratory on
              crystal growth will be developed with direct involvement of undergraduate
              students.

This research will attempt to advance the fundamental
              understanding of the influence of electric and magnetic fields on
              solidification processes. It is anticipated that new methodologies will be
              discovered for semiconductor industries to achieve morphological control and
              micro-structural refinement and alignment as well as the optimization of
              physical properties through control of the process parameters. The availability
              of the virtual laboratory makes it possible to train students in utilizing
              advanced facilities, which is important in furthering education in engineering.
