	Fleas comprise a relatively small holometabolous insect
              order (Siphonaptera) of about 2380 species which are associated with bird and
              mammal hosts.  The phylogenetic relationships among flea families are virtually
              unknown and have remained perplexing.  The purpose of the research component of
              this proposal is to determine phylogenetic relationships of Siphonaptera at the
              familial and generic levels. This will be accomplished by compiling
              morphological and DNA sequence data for a large representation of fleas and
              related taxa, then subjecting these data to rigorous phylogenetic analysis. 
              Once the phylogeny is in place, the current classification of fleas will be
              evaluated and the pattern of mammal-bird host shifts during flea evolution will
              be investigated.

	The purpose of the education component of this proposal is
              to provide a basic systematics education to a wide range of undergraduate
              students, and to furnish significant research experiences to those most
              interested in systematics and evolutionary biology.  Students will be given
              opportunities for field work, collection-based research (e.g., documenting flea
              morphology), lab-based research (e.g., DNA sequencing), and computation
              based-research (e.g., phylogenetic analysis).  The focus will be on developing
              research and analytical skills in undergraduate students, which are necessary
              for successful careers in evolutionary biology.  The education experience
              culminates in a Utah State Systematics symposium where the students present
              their research and have the opportunity to interact with peers from other
              institutions and concludes with students preparing a manuscript for
              publication.  This project will provide much needed information on flea
              phylogeny, facilitate the training of students in systematics, and help spawn
              interest in flea systematics, an field sorely in need of young specialists.
