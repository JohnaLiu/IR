Abstract    :
              Dr. Thomas Cundari of the University of Memphis is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research on computational
              chemistry of transition metal compounds and reactions. The nature and extent of
              pi-bonding in transition metal complexes of group 13 elements (principally
              boron and gallium) will be investigated by computational methods. Nonlinear
              optical properties of the dimer of osmium tetroxide will be computed for a
              number of configurations of the oxygen atoms of that species, and those studies
              will be extended to several types of condensed phases. Activation of C-H bonds
              in heterosubstituted alkanes, through interactions with bimetallic complexes,
              and in beta-X elimination will be studied computationally.

This research
              program involves development of new computional methods to predict properties
              of inorganic materials, and also application of previously developed methods to
              systems of current experimental and technological importance. Details of
              bonding in metal-boron compounds are important in catalytic processes,
              nonlinear optical properties of condensed phases are of great present and
              future significance for electronic applications, and activation of C-H bonds is
              one of the main problem areas in synthetic  and mechanistic chemistry, with
              many connections to important industrial and ecological processes.
