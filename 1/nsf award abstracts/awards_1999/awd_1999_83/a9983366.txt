Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project continues the Pulsed
              Laser Deposition project using a femto-second or sub pico-second pulsed laser. 
              The sub pico-second regime is a recent (just a few years old)development in the
              laser industry.  As technology progresses these lasers are becoming more common
              to both the end user and the commercial manufacturer.  There are now solid
              state femto-second lasers available in the product line of some well known
              laser companies.  The recent advances made in the production and sales of the
              new sub pico-second laser and the results achievable by these lasers have
              opened up new opportunities in tribological coatings.  The Phase I results
              demonstrated superior hardness using the sub pico-second laser as compared to
              the traditional nano-second lasers.  The coatings were also much smoother when
              observed under a scanning electron microscope.  These initial findings suggest 
              a need to continue the study for applications in the tool and space industries 
              as well as the military.  Coatings with such improved performance would be
              considered a significant contribution to both the scientific and industrial
              communities.

Current coatings are short lived and therefore expensive to
              maintain.  A longer life coating, even if it was more expensive, would provide
              significant savings do to the life of the tool, device or machine.  Some
              devices are not even practical to make do to poor performing coatings. 
              Coatings produced using a sub pico-second laser source will change that.
