CAREER: Physiological Responses and Anatomical Pathways
              Involved in the Generation of an Immune Response

	Recent research has shown
              that during a fever, increased activity can be identified in one area of the
              brain, the hypothalamus, which is involved in the regulation of body
              temperature. It has been hypothesized that neurons in this region and their
              specific connections within the brain are important in the ability to produce a
              fever in response to an infection. The goal of this research project is to
              characterize the inherent activity of these neurons and their responses to the
              chemical messenger prostaglandin E2, which is produced by the brain during an
              infection and may trigger fevers. Thin slices of brain tissue from the
              hypothalamus of laboratory rats will be tested in a small temperature chamber.
              Neurons will also be color stained to show their connections and identify
              specific chemical messengers. In addition, this project will involve students
              in all research efforts and bring neuroscience research into the classroom
              through the use of new forms of education technology.
	This project will
              result in the development of an integrated research and educational program,
              allowing students to conduct investigations in the field of neurobiology.
              Specific projects will focus on the ability of the brain to control body
              temperature during normal conditions and in response to an infection, when
              temperature rises in a response known as a fever. While the production of a
              fever is a natural defense mechanism designed to enhance the ability to fight
              infection, extreme elevations in temperature can cause permanent damage to
              internal organs and even death. With the advent of modern clinical medicine, it
              is important to understand the mechanisms involved in the production of a
              fever, so that this response can be controlled, resulting in enhanced benefits
              and limited risk.
