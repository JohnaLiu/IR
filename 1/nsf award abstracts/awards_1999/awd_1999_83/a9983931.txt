Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to study and control bone cell-biomaterial
              interactions.  The specific objectives of this project are to: (1) optimize and
              characterize methods to chemically modify biomaterial surfaces with bioactive
              ligands, (2) investigate protein interactions with chemically modified
              biomaterials, (3) examine focal adhesion formation and subsequent functions of
              osteoblasts and osteoclasts cultured on chemically-modified biomaterials, and
              (4) incorporate mentored student-teaching and active learning opportunities
              into biomedical engineering courses on cell-biomaterial interactions.
