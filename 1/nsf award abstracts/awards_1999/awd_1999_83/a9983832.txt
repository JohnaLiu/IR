This research addresses several problems in the
              intersection of networks and random processes, including the design of erasure
              and error-correcting codes based on random graphs, the analysis of dynamic load
              balancing schemes, and the development of new algorithmic approaches for
              studying the size and structure of the World Wide Web.  These problems, besides
              all relating to the design and analysis of networks, share a common framework:
              they can be embedded into models of dynamic random processes.  As such, they
              often can be attacked using theoretical techniques such as fluid limit models
              and Lyapunov analysis.  A major goal of this research is to develop the proper
              framework for using, improving, and simplifying these techniques, so that they
              may be applied more easily in these and other areas.
Another major goal of the
              proposed research is to connect theory and practice.  For example, the research
              on codes is being applied to the problem of reliable multicast.  The models for
              load balancing in the face of delay are being applied to systems of Web
              servers.  As part of the effort to bridge theoretical work and practical
              problems in modern networks, the PI is planning a new graduate course that
              covers issues in information retrieval, codes, cryptography, and
              compression.
