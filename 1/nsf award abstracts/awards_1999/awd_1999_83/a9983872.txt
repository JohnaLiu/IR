This award is for a study of the phenomenon of
              Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMC), and their relationship to atmospheric
              parameters in the mesopause region, and to global change in the polar
              mesosphere.  There is growing evidence of decadal time scale changes in PMC. 
              It is important to understand the physical causes, which may be related to
              activities of mankind, both agricultural and industrial.  The study will
              involve analysis of data from various satellite and ground-based observational
              techniques, and use of scattering theory to integrate the various measurements
              onto a common basis for intercomparison.  An empirical optical model will be
              constructed which will permit observations of various kinds to be
              intercompared.  An empirical atmospheric model will provide an integration of
              satellite data (along with rocketborne data) from the past decade.  This model
              will describe the temperature and water vapor distributions for the summertime
              polar regions, and also provide information on the time changes of these
              variables over time scales up to an 11-year solar cycle.  The potential impact
              of this study is to produce an increased understanding and awareness of the
              importance of global change in the upper atmosphere, and specifically, the
              polar mesosphere.  Together with the global warming phenonmenon, this project
              will foster public awareness of this very different anthropogenic impact on the
              upper atmosphere.
