Abstract    :
              This project will utilize nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy as a highly
              specific, quantitative probe for vibrational dynamics in iron-containing
              proteins.  Measurements of X-ray absorption with seven wavenumber resolution
              near the Fe-57 Mossbauer resonance will reveal the complete vibrational
              spectrum of Fe at protein active sites.   An investigation of the sensitivity
              of previously unobserved mode frequencies to chemical and conformational
              changes at the active site will be performed.    The feasibility of using
              Kr-83, which binds to internal protein cavities, as a vibrational probe for
              biomolecules that do not contain Fe will also be examined.  The project is
              jointly supported by the Division of Physics, the Molecular Biophysics program
              in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
              Directorate.
