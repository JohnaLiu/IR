Abstract    :
                        This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              develop 2000 degree Centigrade (C) molybdenum alumino-silicide (Mo(Si,Al)2)
              heating elements for advanced manufacturing processes such as sintering,
              brazing, annealing, semiconductor processing, ceramic processing, and pyrolysis
              of solid waste.  Current technology in heating elements permits temperatures
              only as high as 1850-1900 degree C.  The main technical barriers are (1)
              spalling of the silica protective layer at 1850-1900 degree C, which exposes
              the bare MoSi2 to catastrophic oxidation, and (2) extensive weakening by rapid
              grain growth.  Phase II will (1) use alloying elements to form
              oxidation-resistant ternary phase Mo(Si,Al)2, which leads to the formation of a
              stable (up to 2080 degree C) adherent alumina layer, and (2) add nano-scale
              alumina or zirconia (~ 40 nanometers) to stabilize grain growth.  Two
              compositions in the molybdenum-alumino-silicon ternary alloy phase field were
              identified, synthesized, and tested in Phase I.  A rapid heat-up 2000 degree C
              element would be a quantum leap in heating element technology and lead advances
              in high temperature manufacturing.
          Rapid commercialization is
              expected because energy advantages and productivity (time wise) gains will
              accrue to the ceramic manufacturing, metal processing, compound semiconductor
              processing, glass processing, and joining industries.  Total savings of nearly
              $40 million per year are anticipated in lower power consumption in the
              manufacturing industries that use this heating element technology.
