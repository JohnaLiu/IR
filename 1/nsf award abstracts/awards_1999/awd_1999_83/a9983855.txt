Abstract    :
              9983855  Zhang  The objective of the proposed research is the continued
              development of an innovative technology using nanoscale metal particles (NMP)
              to rapidly and completely reduce chlorinated hydrocarbons in either in situ or
              ex situ applications.  The NMP technology is flexible in that it can be
              deployed as a stand-alone remedial system or utilized in conjunction with
              conventional technologies such as pump-and-treat and bioremediation.
Specific
              research objectives include (1) improvement and scale-up of the NMP synthetic
              method, (2) development of direct injection techniques and associated design
              parameters, (3) determination of the transport and attachment mechanisms of
              NMPs in porous media and (4) assessment of the long-term impacts of key
              environmental variables such as redox potential, pH, ionic strength and
              microbial growth on the rate and extent of dechlorination. The work will
              involve the use of both contaminated groundwater and aquifer materials from a
              trichloroethylene (TCE) spill site.
Educational goals are intended to create
              an exciting, multi-disciplinary learning environment where young environmental
              engineers are inspired to devise innovative solutions to real-world problems
              using the contaminant(s) structure as a fundamental design variable. 
              Specifically, interactive course offerings in molecular environmental
              engineering will be developed for the undergraduate and graduate curricula.
It
              is also the goal of this research to stimulate development of critically
              important partnerships with the private sector.  Scientific and engineering
              personnel at partnering firms will be encouraged to participate in both the
              research and educational components of this program.  These partnerships will
              provide opportunities for students, particularly those of under-represented
              groups, to perform practical research and work with experienced practitioners.
