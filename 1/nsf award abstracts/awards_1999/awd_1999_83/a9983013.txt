Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to study the toxicity and resistance to the
              endotoxins produced by the bacterium Bacillus  thuringiensis (Bt) in the
              nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Ten mutations in five different genes that
              confer marked resistance to the Bt toxin Cry5B, a member of the main family of
              Bt toxins, have been isolated. These five Bt resistant (bre) genes map to three
              chromosomes. The specific aims of this research are: 1) To clone the five bre
              genes that confer resistance to Bt toxin 2) To characterize the pathway(s) that
              gives rise to resistance 3) To determine what elements in the pathway are
              common to different Bt toxins and what elements in the pathway are unique to
              different Bt toxins 4) To determine whether bre genes might be involved in Bt
              toxicity and resistance in parasitic nematodes.

Endotoxins produced by B.
              thuringiensis are the most important and prevalent biologically produced
              pesticides in use today. Bt toxins act on invertebrates by damaging and
              destroying their intestinal cells. Despite decades of use of Bt toxins as
              insecticides and the recent introduction of Bt toxin genes in transgenic
              plants, very little is known about the molecular host components required by Bt
              toxicity and no genes that confer resistance to Bt toxins have yet been cloned.
              There are growing concerns about the development of resistance to Bt toxins and
              about the effects of Bt toxins on non-pest species. These concerns increase the
              urgency for understanding the molecular mechanisms for Bt toxin action.
