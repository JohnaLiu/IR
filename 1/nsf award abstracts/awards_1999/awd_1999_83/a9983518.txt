Digital Government:
              Harvesting Information to Sustain our Forests

Historically, forest
              management practices have aimed to maximize harvests, put out fires, and create
              plots of a common age and species.  More recently, there is an increasing
              awareness that forests must be managed to reflect a broad range of local,
              regional and national objectives, including ecological, economic, social and
              recreational.  This research will be a collaboration between the university
              research team and the Adaptive Management Areas program, a multi-agency
              initiative (USDA Forest Service, and two agencies of the US Department of
              Interior, Bureau of Land Management and Fish and Wildlife Service) to design
              and prototype an "Adaptive Management Portal" to make Adaptive Management
              information available in an open, natural and useful way to all parties
              interested in forest lands.  A key technical question is to what extent
              "superimposed information" (information overlaid on the base set of resources)
              can help realize these goals.  There is particular interest in thematic
              organizations based on terminology in common use in the forest practices
              domain, and in the ability for arbitrary users to augment the system with their
              own annotations, linkages and collations that might be of use to others.
