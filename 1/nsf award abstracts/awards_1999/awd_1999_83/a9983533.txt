Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the extension of a successful demonstration of the
              production of aligned populations of nonpolar molecules through the use of
              Autler-Townes splitting to the production of oriented molecules as well. The
              initial work will utilize molecular beams combined with cw lasers.  Beyond
              this, part of the project will seek to enhance the achievable orientation and
              alignment through pulse amplification of the laser.  A second part of the
              project will apply the technique as a means of quantum state control to modify
              the character of a molecular wavefunction.   This work is co-funded by the
              Atomic, Molecular, Optical, and Plasma Physics program and the Experimental
              Physical Chemistry program.
