Abstract    :
              Throughout their life people continually acquire, refine and update concepts.
              These concepts and categories are use to understand, reason about, and make
              predictions concerning actions and events in the world. Although studies have
              provided a good base of information on how people acquire and use concepts,
              current theory and data are weighted toward category learning and organization
              among populations of relative novices. Our findings to date suggest that key
              generalizations concerning conceptual behavior may not hold for more expert
              populations. In addition our findings are revealing new principles of
              categorization and the use of categories in reasoning which are not addressed
              by current theories. This project will continue to investigate how the
              organization and use of categories changes as a function of goals and
              experience. Our study populations include different cultures as well as
              different types of expertise. We have begun to develop new models for
              category-based reasoning and the proposed studies will provide empirical tests
              of a new theory of inductive reasoning. This project constitutes basic research
              on human cognition but it is relevant to a variety of practical contexts such a
              science education.
