Abstract    :
              Visual pigments are the proteins that capture light and convert light signal to
              neural signal in the photoreceptor cells in the retina.   Red, green, and blue
              visual pigments absorb light at long, medium, and short wavelength,
              respectively, in cone photoreceptors and mediate day vision in humans. 
              Throughout our lives, visual pigments are continuously synthesized and
              transported to the outer segments of photoreceptor cells. Removal and renewal
              of a substantial portion of the visual pigments take place every day.  
              Daylight vision in all animals relies heavily on cone visual pigments; however,
              little is known about the biosynthetic process of cone visual pigments. 
              Starting with the translation of the mRNA, the biosynthesis of visual pigments
              occurs in multiple stages.  It involves insertion of the translated protein
              into the lipid bilayer, and co- and post-translational modifications that
              potentially include changes in the folding-intermediate structures. 
              Subsequently, binding of 11-cis retinal and formation of the light sensitive
              pigment, and transport to the final destination in the outer segment occur. 
              Our previous studies showed that the folding of red-cone pigment to the
              functional three-dimensional structure requires help from another protein
              called Ran binding protein 2 (RanBP2), a large multi-functional protein.  The
              goal of this project is to determine when RanBP2 is required during the red
              opsin biosynthetic pathway and what specific role(s) it subserves.   Red opsin
              will be produced in the presence and absence of various domains of RanBP2 in
              mammalian cells.  How the synthesis, folding, stability, or degradation of red
              opsin are affected by different domains of RanBP2 will be investigated. 
              Results from this study will provide insight into the molecular mechanism of
              cone opsin biosynthesis for the first time.
