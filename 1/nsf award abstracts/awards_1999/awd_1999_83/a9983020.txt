Abstract    :
              The ability to give birth to live young occurs in all classes of
vertebrates
              except cyclostomes and birds.  In a unique order of tropical
amphibians, the
              caecilian amphibians, the majority of species give birth to
live young but the
              physiological mechanisms which control this process are
unknown.  It is
              proposed that fetal caecilian gills function as endocrine
organs and produce
              hormones similar to those produced by mammalian
placentas.  Such structures
              have not been described in non-mammals.  The
goal of this project is to
              determine whether fetal caecilian tissues
produce steroid hormones.  The
              methods to be used include identification of
steroid metabolites produced by
              tissues in vitro and localization of
enzymes known to function in steroid
              synthesis.  Maternal steroid hormone
levels will be determined.

These
              studies will provide the first information on steroid endocrinology
and the
              control of live- bearing for this order of amphibians.  They will
thus
              contribute substantially to understanding of reproductive biology
              and
conservation of these unique animals and also to hormonal control
              of
pregnancy in other vertebrates.
