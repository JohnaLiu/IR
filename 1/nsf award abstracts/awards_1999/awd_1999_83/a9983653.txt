The goal of this research is to develop and validate
              pattern
recognition methods such as Decision Trees (DTs) and Neural Networks
              (NNs)
for electric power system wide-area open-loop discrete-event control. 
              The
proposed controls will provide Independent Service Operators (ISOs)
              and
present-day utilities with tools necessary to achieve the cost
              reduction
goals of deregulation without sacrificing reliability.  The
              proposed
research will investigate the selection of contingencies to simulate
              for
the training data, algorithms for converting simulation data into
              input-
output pairs that make up the training sets, and measures of
              performance
used to evaluate the classifier operation.  The PI and graduate
              students
will collaborate with researchers at Cornell University and the
              Bonneville
Power Administration and will test the proposed methods against
              other
schemes reported in the literature for out-of-step relaying,
              generator
tripping, active load modulation, HVDC fast power changes, and
              reactive
power switching.  Students in EE 588, Advanced Topics in Power
              Systems,
will train and test NNs on data from the research.  Undergraduate
              students
in EE 479, Automatic Control Systems Laboratory, will design
              feedback
controls for the simple power system model that is analyzed in
              this
proposal.  The PI will engage all students in active learning
              through
frequent and extensive exercises that lead students through the
              discovery
process of problem solving instead of just rewarding the
              memorization of
techniques.  The PI will distribute detailed, annotated
              solutions to all
homework problems on the due date.  These teaching methods
              have been found
by the PI to be successful with a broad spectrum of students,
              including
women, minorities and people with disabilities.
