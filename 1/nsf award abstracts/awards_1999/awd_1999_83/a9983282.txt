Abstract    :
              Rice is considered a model species for monocotyledonous plants, which include
              cereals such as maize, wheat, sorghum, and barley.  Rice has a relatively small
              genome, is diploid, is readily transformable, and has tractable genetics and a
              diverse germplasm.  These attributes, in addition to its role as a major food
              source for a majority of the world's population, have resulted in the
              development of genetic and molecular resources focused on obtaining the
              complete genome sequence of rice.  Not only will the complete sequence of rice
              provide a reservoir of genes by which to understand rice growth and
              development, but it will also provide a set of molecular tools to leverage
              sequence information to highly related species such as maize, wheat and barley,
              which are more recalcitrant to genomic approaches.  This award will enable a
              total of 31.5 Mb of rice genomic sequence to be generated and released to
              Genbank.  This sequence will be annotated using gene prediction programs,
              related genes within the database will be identified, and repetitive structures
              and sequences characterized.  In addition, links between rice data and
              sequence, physical, and genetic information from other plant species will be
              generated.  All of this work will be performed in conjunction with the
              international rice genome project.
