Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build and test a
              1/30 scale prototype photo bioreactor system, which converts waste gas
              emissions from confinement swine facilities into algae (biomass).  Large
              confinement production facilities account for a majority of livestock
              production and represent a significant source of odor and greenhouse gases as
              well as large quantities of solid and liquid waste.  Phase I research
              demonstrated the ability to capture waste gases from a confinement swine
              facility and use it to produce micro-algae using a photo bioreactor.  The
              research demonstrated that the algae in the photo bioreactor removed more than
              90 percent of the waste gases and odors.  During Phase II a 1/30-scale
              prototype photo bioreactor system will be built and attached to an existing
              swine confinement facility.  The system will be tested using a variety of media
              and algae or photo organism species during the Phase II
research.  If
              successful a full scale demonstration unit will be built and tested in Phase
              III with sales of the system following. The system will address a serious
              environmental problem while reducing operating costs for swine producers by
              providing a feed supplement, algae biomass, and creating the potential to
              extract valuable co-products from the micro-algae.

The initial market for
              the bioair photobioreactor will be large swine operations.  Pro Edge, a large
              swine producer,  has agree to purchase the first demonstration unit and plans
              to purchase an additional 100 to 300 systems if they work as anticipated. While
              sales of the system will generate revenue, the ultimate goal is to extract high
              value components from the algae for use in pharmaceuticals, pigments,
              carbohydrates, and other chemical products.  The market for these products is
              estimated to be approximately $6 billion in 2000.
