Fungus-growing ants comprise a group of about 200 species,
              all obligately dependent on the cultivation of fungus for food.  Fungal
              cultivation by ants involves complex manuring regimes and use of antibiotic
              "herbicides" to control alien fungi and garden parasites.  Recent genetic
              analyses indicate that fungus-growing ants domesticated fungal cultivars
              multiple times during their evolutionary history and frequently exchange these
              cultivars between ant species.  The evolutionary ecology of cultivar exchange
              between ants will be investigated by testing a series of hypotheses on the
              ecological factors that govern exchanges.  Field experiments will be conducted
              in Panama and the southwestern US, complemented by genetic analyses of the
              diversity of ants, their cultivars, and associated pathogens. Model ant-fungus
              systems will be developed to test specific hypotheses on the evolutionary and
              ecological relationships between ant farmers, their cultivars, associated
              garden parasites, and the ecological conditions modulating these relationships.
               

The attine ant-fungus symbiosis represents a unique case of evolutionary
              and ecological complexity.  This complexity derives from the interaction of
              pathogenic and mutualistic microbes that evolved to form integrated parts of
              the ecological fabric of a social animal, the ant farmers.  The research will
              yield a synthetic understanding of this 50-million-year antfarmer-cultivar
              association.
