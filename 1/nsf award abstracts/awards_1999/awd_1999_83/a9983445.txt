Digital Government: 
              Knowledge Management over Time-Varying Geospatial Datasets

Spatially-related
              data is collected by many government agencies in various formats and for
              various uses.  This project seeks to facilitate the integration of these data,
              thus providing new uses.  This will require the development of a knowledge
              management framework to provide syntax, context, and semantics, as well as
              exploring the introduction of time-varying data into the framework.  Education
              and outreach will be part of the project through the development of an on-line
              short courses related to data integration in the area of geographical
              information systems.  The grantees will be working with government partners
              (National Imagery and Mapping Agency, the National Agricultural Statistics
              Service, and the US Army Topographic Engineering Center), as well as an
              industrial organization, Base Systems, and the non-profit OpenGIS Consortium,
              which works closely with vendors of GIS products.
