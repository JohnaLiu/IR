Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further the
              design, development, construction, and evaluation of a prototype fish freshness
              sensor based on the successful Phase I feasibility demonstration of using an
              array of semiconducting metal oxide chemiresistive sensors for quantitative
              fish freshness quality determination.  The advantages of this approach to fish
              freshness monitoring is that the array data will provide information about the
              complex gases emitted by fish during degradation and will provide a basis for
              signal processing techniques to quantify the fish freshness.  

The Phase II
              research is directed towards extending the Phase I demonstration of determining
              the freshness of Atlantic salmon to other species of fish and to a wider
              variety of fish handling procedures.  The fish freshness sensor data will be
              compared with results from a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and a sensory
              evaluation panel of trained individuals.   A field-deployable prototype will be
              tested on location at fish processing plants to non-destructively determine the
              degree of degradation of fresh marine fin fish.
