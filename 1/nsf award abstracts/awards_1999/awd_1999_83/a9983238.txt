Digital Government:  A Multinational
              Investigation of New Models of Collaboration for Government Services to
              Citizens and Businesses

This award will provide planning support to test a
              conceptual framework and associated research methodologies of a multinational
              research program to study organizational partnerships engaged in the delivery
              of services to citizens and businesses.  The defining characteristic of these
              partnerships is the voluntary combination of separate organizations into a
              coherent service delivery system supported by advanced information
              technologies.  The extremely rapid evolution of these technologies has created
              important new opportunities for governments to redesign services through
              partnerships with other organizations elsewhere in government, in business, or
              in the non-profit sector.  This research seeks to analyze and document how
              these new partnerships develop and perform.
