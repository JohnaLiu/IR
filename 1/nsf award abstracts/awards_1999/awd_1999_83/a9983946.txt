 Fault
              Diagnostics for Automated Vehicle Applications
 ABSTRACT

This project
              focuses on the development of fault diagnostic systems that can monitor the
              health of all the sensors and actuators on an automated vehicle and identify
              the source of any fault that occurs.  Both semi-automated vehicles (such as in
              adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping-type applications) as well as fully
              automated vehicles on dedicated automated highway systems are
              investigated.

Two key research challenges are addressed in the project. 
              First, since vehicle dynamic models can be highly nonlinear, a systematic fault
              diagnostics methodology is developed for nonlinear systems based on nonlinear
              observer design results.    Second, the issue of obtaining analytical
              redundancy for sensors that measure inter-vehicle and vehicle-road variables is
              addressed.  The difficulty in this task arises from the fact that each of these
              sensor measurements involve a second dynamic system, with no access being
              available to sensors of the other dynamic system.  The experimental work plan
              in the project includes experimental implementation of the entire fault
              diagnostic system on a Volvo truck and a Navistar tractor-trailer at the MnRoad
              research facility. 

The project addresses an important aspect of
              vehicle/highway automation.  The development of reliable fault diagnostic and
              fault handling systems is necessary in order to make vehicle automation viable.
               Educational objectives of the project include textbook and curriculum
              development.
