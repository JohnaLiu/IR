              COPLINK Center: Information and Knowledge Management for Law Enforcement

The
              information and knowledge management problems facing many government agencies
              stem from barriers to access and utilization resulting from the content and
              format of information.  These problems make information (and eventually
              knowledge) creation and utilization and complex and daunting process.  New
              knowledge management technologies have started to emerge in a number of
              different applications and organizations, such as virtual enterprising, joint
              ventures, aerospace engineering and digital libraries.  However, there has been
              no systematic attempt to study the technical, social and managerial foundation,
              theory and methodology of knowledge management that can be adopted in various
              social and industrial contexts.  The COPLINK Center for Excellence aims to
              achieve the following two goals:  1) Develop knowledge management systems
              technologies and methodology that are appropriate for capturing, analyzing,
              visualizing and sharing law enforcement related information in social and
              organizational contexts.  The basis of such research will be grounded in
              information retrieval, computational linguistics, information visualization,
              artificial intelligence, multimedia systems, multi-agent systems, and
              telecommunications.  2) Study of organizational, social, cultural and
              methodological impacts and changes that organizations need to make to maximize
              and leverage on a law enforcement agency's investments in information and
              knowledge management.  The academic foundation for such research will be based
              on social informatics, decision theory, communication theory, cognitive
              psychology and managerial and organizational research.
