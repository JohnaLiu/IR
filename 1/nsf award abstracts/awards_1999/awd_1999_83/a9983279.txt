Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will refine, validate,
              and extend new methods developed in Phase I to compute the community-level risk
              of extinction or demographic threat for individual sites or landscapes and
              assign a multispecies conservation value.  The objective of such methods is to
              provide a statistically valid approach to ecological valuation and landscape
              management.  This research will provide an
independent measure of the value of
              a particular site based on its ecological components, i.e., species, and the
              threats facing it.  The new methods will estimate a multispecies conservation
              value as a spatially explicit weighting of species-specific habitat suitability
              maps by their respective species-specific extinction risks. This research will
              also develop a multivariate generalization of recently described exact methods
              for computing risk of extinction for species of which little is known.  Two
              potential areas of commercial applications of this project include software
              sales and case studies.  The final product of the proposed research will be
              part of RAMAS Library of Ecological Software, and will be made available to
              potential users in overnmental agencies and industrial companies.
