Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Program (SBIR) Phase II project utilizes
              a unique photo-curable, high weight-yield preceramic polymer in a continuous
              fabrication process to produce a low-cost beta-silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic
              composite.  Phase I succeeded in both photo curing and cold-initiation rapid
              curing (5 minutes) of a new polymer with higher ceramic yield, easier
              processability, and greater scalability than anticipated.  Phase II will
              optimize the new polymer for both 'cure on demand' and viscoelastic volumetric
              compression in order to increase ceramic matrix density and to eliminate
              polymer springback between fabric layers.  Use of pre-preg technology will
              enable large sheets and rolls of fabric to be impregnated and cured into a
              rubbery, coated fabric-polymer body that can be easily stored, cut to pattern,
              and applied in a ply-by-ply process.  Process machinery will be scaled up to
              produce component sizes of commercial interest with fast curing and automated
              part fabrication.

Potential commercial application are anticipated in gas
              recirculating fans, heat exchangers, radiant burner screens and tubes, gas
              turbine engine combustion liners and tip shrouds, hot liquid filtration,
              containment shells, gas-fired melting immersion burner tubes, and furnace pipe
              hangers.  Ultimately, large composite structures may be constructed for
              vehicles such as hypersonic aircraft.
