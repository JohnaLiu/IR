Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at developing
              and demonstrating an innovative information-rich and real-time system for
              particle characterization.  Encouraged by results from Phase I which
              established the feasibility of using polarized light scattering for
              characterization of micron, sub-micron and nano-sized ceramic particles,
              Synergetic Technologies proposes to develop an accurate and reliable on-line
              instrument.  Phase I illustrated the high accuracy achievable, the ability to
              detect and quantify nano-size particles, and the capability of determining the
              size distribution of high aspect ratio whiskers and irregularly shaped
              particles.  Project tasks include: system design, construction, calibration and
              testing; software development for more accurate shape determination and
              automized system use; study of different lasers; and testing and demonstration
              at three potential customer sites (a major ceramic research university, a large
              industrial research laboratory, and a small company at the leading edge of
              nanomaterials production). The University of Kentucky staff and students will
              assist in this project.
 
The ability to measure fine particle sizes and
              shapes on-line is necessary for controlling the quality of many high technology
              products, such as advanced ceramics and pharmaceuticals.  In addition,
              monitoring and controlling particle size is fundamental to the manufacture of
              many consumer products, medical products, food processing and environmental
              monitoring.
