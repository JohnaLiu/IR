Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for two years of work focused on the measurement and
              analysis of network performance from the perspective of endpoint applications.
              To date, much of the high performance network measurement activity has focused
              on the core network and its potential.  This work will help to develop
              understanding about the additional problems faced in marrying campus
              infrastructures and LAN infrastructures to a high speed backbone. Building on
              prior work with tools such as OCXmon, Coral, SNMP, and others, the research
              will utilize experiments customized to high speed applications and will
              incorporate the data collection, postprocessing, and eventual opportunity for
              network feedback to applications for purposes of adaptivity or monitoring. One
              additional emphasis will be to work with those engaged in developing new
              generations of network-based applications in order to factor in their
              requirements and to verify the measurement results.
