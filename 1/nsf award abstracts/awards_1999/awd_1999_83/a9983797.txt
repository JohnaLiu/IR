              Abstract:

This CAREER award supports research on the combinatorial structures
              of Schubert varieties, primarily by studying their singularities. Schubert
              varieties are fascinating geometrical objects which lie at the intersection of
              several fields of mathematics; their study began with the classical works in
              projective geometry of the nineteen century.  Better understanding of these
              structures would have impact in algebraic geometry, combinatorics and
              representation theory. Outside of mathematics, these results may have
              applications in theoretical physics, computer graphics, and the study of Bucky
              balls (Carbon-60 molecules).  A further goal of this proposal is to explore the
              changing roll of computers in mathematics.  Computer verification and computer
              proofs play a central role in characterizing properties of Schubert varieties
              by pattern avoidance.

An important aspect of this proposal is its
              educational component. Mathematics education and research are intrinsically
              linked - research brings out the creativity and drive needed to learn new
              mathematical concepts.  In particular, undergraduate students enjoy the
              challenge of facing unsolved problems.  However, due to the nature of
              mathematics research, finding "good" undergraduate research problems is
              difficult.  Computer verified proofs and computer experimentation are
              particularly well suited to the skills and knowledge of undergraduates while
              also of interest to graduate students and more senior researchers.  Therefore,
              this line of research has been incorporated into the education portion of the
              proposal through a new course and undergraduate research projects.
