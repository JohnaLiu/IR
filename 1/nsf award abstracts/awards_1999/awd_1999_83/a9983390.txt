Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II Project is aimed to develop a
              novel vertical geometry Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (HBT) based on
              III-nitride heterostructures grown on SiC (silicon carbide).  There is a strong
              need for high power HBTs for highly linear, high power microwave amplifiers. 
              The innovation of this proposal is to demonstrate WBG (wide band gap) HBTs on
              SiC that will take advantage of the vertical geometry, and high thermal
              conductivity of SiC through the use of highly conductive novel nitride buffer
              and base structure to enhance p-type lateral conductivity with improved
              vertical transport properties through the base.

The proposed vertical WBG
              HBT device is a critical component for a new generation of satellite and base
              stations for wireless communication networks.   Another application area is DC
              switch components for high power electronics.
