Abstract    :
              The ability to perceive an object's motion is essential to our
interacting with
              objects, including avoiding objects that are about to
collide with us.  In
              addition, our ability to predict where an object
will emerge after traveling
              behind another object (occluder) depends
upon our ability to accurately
              perceive the object's motion trajectory. 
This project is designed to better
              understand how the human visual
system processes trajectory motion
              information.  Several experimental
approaches will be used to study trajectory
              motion processing.  The
accuracy of observers' speed and direction judgments
              of a target object
will be measured and the effects of other moving objects
              (motion noise)
on those judgments will be determined.  How accurate observers
              can
determine where an object, moving on a straight trajectory, will
              emerge
from behind an occluder will also be measured.  How this performance
              is
affected by the length of time the object is hidden and the distance
that
              the object travels while hidden will be determined.  The same
information will
              be obtained for objects moving on curved trajectories. 
It is expected that
              objects moving in similar directions and speed will
have a large detrimental
              effect on judgments of a target object's motion
while objects with dissimilar
              motions will have little effect.   It is
also expected that the if a moving
              object is hidden behind an occluder
for an extended period of time and travels
              a large distance, predictions
of where it will emerge will be poor.  In
              addition, curved motion
trajectories should make performance even worse.  This
              project will help
scientists better understand motion perception and how the
              brain
processes trajectory motion information.
