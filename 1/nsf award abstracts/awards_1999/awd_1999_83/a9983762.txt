Combustion processes,
              which involve liquid fuel droplets in a carrier gas, are present in many
              technological applications.  They also involve complex phenomena whose accurate
              modeling, as is sought in this research, will have important beneficial effects
              for these and other applications.  The PI is well positioned to make the
              contributions that are promised in the proposal.  His proposal is praised for
              his educational program that is expected to bring benefits to the identified
              student population.
