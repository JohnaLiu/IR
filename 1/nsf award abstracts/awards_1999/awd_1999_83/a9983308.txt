Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will enable Physical
              Optics Corporation (POC) to build a highly robust and adaptive face recognition
              system called the Opto-electronic Intelligent Face Recognition System (OIFRS).
              This system will uniquely combine an artificial neural network and an optical
              joint transform correlator (JTC) to increase invariance to distortion, shift,
              scale, and facial expression. In Phase I, we conducted a concept feasibility
              study and demonstration, developing an optical face recognition system. In
              Phase II, POC will implement a parallel optical JTC to increase processing
              speed, accommodate a large number of training patterns, and enhance
              scalability. POC will design, develop, and implement an innovative, adaptive,
              nonlinear, self-aligned pseudo-phase-conjugate joint Fourier-Fresnel transform
              correlator, which will make recognition highly invariant to longitudinal
              translation and tilt of the input face, and to head position. The proposed
              innovative OIFRS technology will lead not only to a new robust face recognition
              system but also to a variety of other security systems with high dual use
              application potential.

OIFRS versatility will benefit not only the national
              security concerns of DOE, DoD, and other agencies that require highly secure
              access control, but also commercial access control, and credit card
              verification.
