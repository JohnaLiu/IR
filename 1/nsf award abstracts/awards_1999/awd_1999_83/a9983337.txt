Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at developing
              a novel digital x-ray detector for macromolecular crystallography.  This
              detector is based on a new generation micro-pixelized scintillator optically
              coupled to a large area digital readout array.  The micro-pixelized
              scintillator will provide a unique combination of very high sensitivity,
              spatial resolution, and signal to noise ratios resulting in excellent point
              spread function (PSF), thus improving the quality of the measured Bragg peak
              data.

When integrated with a large area digital optical detector it will
              allow a wide dynamic range and substantially enhanced throughput at relatively
              low costs.  In addition to the structural biology application, the proposed
              detector would find widespread use in instrumentation wherever high-resolution
              x-ray imaging is used.
