Abstract    :
              Professor Michael Duncan of the University of Georgia is supported by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental studies on gas
              phase metal ion clusters.   The metal/ligand complexes produced via laser
              vaporization techniques serve as models for metal-ligand binding, metal ion
              solvation and surface-adsorbate bonding.   Various spectroscopies including
              optical and infrared laser photodissociation spectroscopy and ZEKE-PFI
              photoelectron spectroscopy are utilized to determine structures and
              dissociation energies of the complexes, with the new IR double resonance
              experiments drawing much interest.  The complexes include those of magnesium,
              calcium and aluminum interacting with water, ammonia and methanol.  Extensions
              to larger organometallic complexes such as metal-coronene are also proposed.
              

A successful outcome of this proposal would be an accurate and detailed
              picture of the bonding in metal-ligand complexes.    There are important
              applications of such knowledge in materials and biological chemistry.
