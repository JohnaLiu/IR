Abstract    :
              In this project, a plan is outlined to continue the efforts of the Student
              Meeting Activities Subcommittee of the Power Engineering Education Committee of
              the IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) to promote student interest in the
              power engineering field by sponsoring electrical engineering students from US
              universities to attend the IEEE PES annual Winter Meeting to be held in
              Singapore.  The goal of this project is to provide an opportunity for students
              to be exposed to the most recent developments in operation, construction, and
              research in the power engineering field.  This is a particularly critical time
              for power engineering as the industry undergoes significant change due to the
              restructuring to the traditional utility structure.  The career opportunities
              for students interested in power engineering are many and varied; the program
              offers student several opportunities to interact with practicing engineers from
              utilities, vendors, manufactures, and consulting firms.
