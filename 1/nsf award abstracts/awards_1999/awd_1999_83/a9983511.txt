Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              novel low-cost microfabrication technology for vacuum microelectronics. 
              Affordable and reliable microfabrication of refractory materials is needed,
              since these materials are able to withstand high temperature and severe
              electromagnetic radiation.  Although several materials have been identified as
              candidates, they have both high cost and difficulties with high aspect ratio,
              high resolution bulk micromachining.  An approach based on self-organized
              nanoporous anodic alumina with unique anisotropy morphology will allow high
              aspect ratio, high resolution micromachining.  Phase I demonstrated that a
              vacuum microtriode with promising performance could be fabricated from
              micromachined alumina ceramic.  This may be the only technology for making
              ceramic micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) for vacuum microelectronics and
              other applications, that are stable in harsh environments, have mechanical
              durability, are compatible with mainstream microfabrication, cost less, and
              scale up suitably.  Phase II will optimize the technology and design, fabricate
              prototypes of vacuum integrated circuits (logic and amplifier), and scale-up
              the processes of device batch production for evaluation.

Potential
              commercial applications include vacuum microelectronics and MEMS for the harsh
              environments of space, satelliate communicaitons, radars, deep drilling,
              nuclear reactors, as well as less strenuous environments that attend such uses
              as cellular phone networks, flat panel displays, and various sensors
