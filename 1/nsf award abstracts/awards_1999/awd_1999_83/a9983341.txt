Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project follows a successful
              Phase I technology demonstration and will establish the feasibility of a
              multimode (IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth) data communications system using a
              single-chip radio modem and a single-chip baseband processor, both software
              configurable. The program objectives are, (1) Quantify key system design
              parameters, (2) Determine the best suited radio and baseband processor
              architectures, (3) Identify critical system features and interfaces
needed to
              assure system applicability to existing and anticipated commercial
              applications.systems, (4) Specify a radio and baseband system to be simulated
              with the Ameranth 21st Century Restaurant(TM) commercial design software, (5)
              Design a prototype radio, (6) Construct a prototype transceiver module using
              selected Ameranth terminals, (7)Demonstrate the operation of the system using
              the Ameranth terminals/system application(s), and (8) Prepare for initial
              production and commercialization. The technology is a Bluetooth chipset
              implementation using silicon-on-insulator wafer structure and BiCMOS transistor
              structure.

The market for wireless computing devices is enormous. Ameranth
