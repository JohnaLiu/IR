Abstract    :
              A central question in evolutionary biology is how morphology, function and
              habitat use have evolved.  Arboreal animals have independently evolved many
              remarkable adapatations for locomotion, sucha as adhesive toepads and
              prehensile tails that enable them to move through their complex habitats. 
              However, most studies of locomotion have taken place under conditions that
              approximate terrestrial habitats, yet arboreal habitats pose unique functional
              challenges for animals because of varying surface diameters and steep inclines.
               Futher, no studies have examined how animals segregate arboreal habitats based
              on surface diameters and inclines.  The PIs will address these issues by
              examining a group of eight morphologically diverse arboreal Anolis lizard
              species whose evolutionary retationships are well-understood.  Laboratory
              studies will reveal the effects of both surfac diameter and incline on the
              movement patterns (kinematics) and muscle activity patterns (EMGs) of these
              species, whereas field studies will address how often these species use
              particular surface diameters and inclines.  This Integrative approach will
              yield important insights into the nature of adaptation and how environmental
              variables affect locomotion.
