Abstract
     
        In both terrestrial and aquatic
              systems, limited knowledge of how poor food quality impacts herbivores is a
              major deficiency in our understanding of food chain function.  Zooplankton are
              the dominant herbivores in the open waters of lakes  and ocean, forming a key
              link between phytoplankton and fish.  Although effects of food quality on
              zooplankton have been documented  in laboratory experiments, evidence from
              nature is very limited. DeMott proposes we propose to use new techniques
              developed by DeMott to study natural  gradients in food quality for
              zooplankton.  Two questions will be addressed: 1) What mechanisms explain
              differences in food quality between stratified (deep) and unstratified
              (shallow) lakes and along depth and horizontal gradients within lakes? and 2)
              What physiological traits underlie differences in the abilities of zooplankton
              
species to exploit food resources along these gradients. Growth and feeding
              experiments will be conducted at the Kellogg Biological Station, Michigan with
              food resources from lakes. These experiments are designed to test alternative
              hypotheses of food quality simultaneously, and to obtain results that can be
              generalized within and across lake types. The second part of the  project, to
              be conducted at DeMott's laboratory in Indiana, will test  zooplankton species
              along gradients of food quality using laboratory foods. This project will
              enhance our understanding of food chain function in the plankton and in
              herbivore-plant interactions in general.
