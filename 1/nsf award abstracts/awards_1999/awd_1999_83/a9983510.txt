              Government:  12T An Information Testbed for Digital Government

This project
              will address one of the major problems in government information systems, the
              inability to integrated information from various heterogeneous data sources. 
              Usually these data are collected and managed by different agencies at different
              levels of government, providing more impediments to integration.  Partners from
              the Bureau of the Census, National Archives and Records Administration, US
              Geological Survey, the State of Pennsylvania, and the San Diego Association of
              Governments will work with researchers from the San Diego Supercomputer Center,
              the University of California at San Diego, the University of Michigan, and the
              University of Pennsylvania.

Building upon the initial work of the Mediation
              of Information using XML (MIX) project, this grant has four major technical
              thrusts:

1. allow for an extension of MIX's wrapper technology to the domain
              of geospatial information,
2. develop data transfer protocols for lightweight
              network-based agents,
3. investigate new interfaces to the data, and
4. build
              wrapper toolkits for geospatial and statistical survey metadata.
