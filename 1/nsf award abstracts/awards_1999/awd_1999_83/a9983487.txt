Abstract    :
              In many cultures, homicide is the result of emotional reactions to perceived and
              real romantic infidelity. Jealousy also plays a prominent role in domestic
              violence and family breakup. Current research on jealousy has centered on
              Darwinian analyses that view jealousy as a specific innate adaptation that
              takes different forms in men and women. According to this perspective, men are
              innately disposed to react with hostility to indications of sexual infidelity,
              whereas women are innately disposed to react most intensely to indications of
              emotional infidelity. This research critically examines this theory and
              contrasts it with alternative accounts emphasizing social cognition. Whereas
              almost all research pertaining to jealousy and infidelity has focused on one
              aspect at a time of mating psychology, the current study explores the
              interrelation of jealousy with other individual differences, including sexual
              experience, relationship history and sociosexuality. The research also departs
              from an exclusive focus on hypothetical responses by collecting and analyzing a
              large group of subjects' descriptions of emotional reactions to actual
              incidents of infidelity in their lives. This research should enhance our
              understanding of some of the factors that contribute to the experience of
              jealousy, which may have possible applications in addressing social problems
              such as domestic violence and family breakup.
