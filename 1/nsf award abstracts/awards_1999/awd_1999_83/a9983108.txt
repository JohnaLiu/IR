The goal of this research is to determine the
              three-dimensional structures of the pectate degrading enzymes, using X-ray
              crystallography. The work will focus on bacterial forms of the enzymes, from
              the phytopathogenic Ralsonia solanacearum, Erwinia carotovora, and Erwinia
              chrysanthemi.   To obtain the details of the structures of specific residues,
              both catalytic and substrate binding, the structure determination of several
              additional polygalacturonases, pectate lyases, and pectin lyases will be
              carried out. 

Pectate degrading enzymes have significant roles in
              agriculture, as well as industry.  The microbial forms of the enzymes are
              virulence factors in plant diseases associated with plant tissue maceration. 
              Plant polygalacturonases are involved in plant growth and fruit ripening. 
              Fungal polygalacturonases are widely used in the food and beverage industry,
              particularly in juice preparation.  Polygalacturonase and pectate lyase bind
              the same saccharide polymer, but cleave the glycosidic bond by different
              enzymatic mechanisms.  In contrast, pectin lyase binds to a methyl-esterified
              form of the saccharide polymer, but cleaves the glycosidic bond by a similar
              mechanism as pectate lyase.  These enzymes provide a convenient system to probe
              structural differences between hydrolytic (polygalacturonase) and b-elimination
              (pectate and pectin lyase) cleavage of glycosidic bonds.  The abundance of
              isoforms of these enzymes allows a structural comparison to elucidate
              differences in enzymatic rates and differences in the degree of polymerization
              of the oligogalacturonide endproducts.
