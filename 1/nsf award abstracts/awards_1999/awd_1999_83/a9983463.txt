              Government:  Testbed for High Speed "End to End" Communications in Support of
              Comprehensive Emergency Management

This project will explore the use of
              rapidly deployable "last mile" aerostat-based wireless high-speed
              communications in the environment of emergency management.  The technology base
              will be Local Multipoint Distribution Service radio. An important element of
              the work will be rapid deployment, so equipment must be portable and able to
              access remote databases and GIS engines; a base station and two field units
              will be constructed.  The primary partner agency initially will be the National
              Response Center, which is responsible for responding to chemical spills, toxic
              agent release, and related environmental problems.  Other agencies, such as the
              Federal Emergency Management Agency, will be targets for future partnerships
