Abstract    :
              Paul  Devlin of Oklahoma State University is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform experimental and theoretical
              studies on the structure and dynamics of free-standing ice using Fourier
              transform-infrared spectroscopy of nanocrystals and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo
              calculations. This work is giving information on the strengths of bonds between
              water molecules and the nature of the dangling, unsatisfied surface bonds.  In
              detail, he is study (i) the interaction the surface of ice with both strong
              (ammonia, ethylene oxide, methanol, small ethers, strong acids) and
              intermediate strength (sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and cyanide, ethylene)
              absorbates, (ii) the quantitative kinetics of conversion of ice nanocrystals to
              acid hydrates, (iii) the catalytic role of small ether molecules in aiding the
              conversion of ice to clathrate hydrates and (iv) an exploration of the
              chemistry of organic nanoparticles in three dimensional arrays.  Several stages
              are involved in these interactions including initial absorption, insertion of
              adsorbed molecules into weak hydrogen bonds, surface relaxation and subsurface
              relaxation or formation of the hydrate phase.

These studies will give a more
              detailed understanding of the nature of the surface of ice  and the mechanisms
              by which different molecules absorb strongly and weakly onto ice nanocrystals. 
              The work has broad applications to the role of ice particles in the destruction
              of stratospheric ozone, their significance in the diurnal variations of the
              atmospheres of the icy moons of Jupiter, the chemistry on the ice mantles of
              interstellar dust particles and the control of hydrated species in fuel
              science.
