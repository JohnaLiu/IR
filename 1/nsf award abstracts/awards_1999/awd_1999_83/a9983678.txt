Abstract    :
              The research supported under this CAREER award to this young PI consists of a
              study of structural, piezoelectric and dielectric properties of ferroelectric
              alloys.  The study will be conducted using three different although
              complementary approaches: (1) A very accurate first principles technique for
              electronic structure calculations, (2) an effective Hamiltonian approach which
              will extend the reach of first-principles calculations to realistic systems at
              finite temperatures and (3) simple models which will provide a microscopic
              understanding of some complex alloy phenomena.  In education, the PI is
              planning to integrate computational condensed matter physics in undergraduate
              and graduate courses at the University of Arkansas.

Materials with large
              dielectric constants are technologically very important, most prominently in
              the hand-held communications (for example in reducing the size of cell phones)
              industry.  There are other applications such as piezoelectric transducers and
              actuators, non-volatile ferroelectric memories, pyroelectric arrays and
              non-linear optical applications.  This CAREER grant will help this PI study the
              properties of ferroelectric alloys and other materials with notable dielectric
              properties.  Beginning with the properties of electrons in atoms making up the
              solid, using sophisticated computational techniques and computers, this PI will
              set up a program of research to study these materials.  He also plans to
              integrate this combined (mathematical-computational) approach in courses at the
              undergraduate and graduate level.
