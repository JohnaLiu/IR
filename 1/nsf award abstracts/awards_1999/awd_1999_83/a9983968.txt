Abstract    :
              Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) is an innovative Solid Freeform Fabrication
              (SFF) process which is capable of manufacturing metallic parts with complex
              shapes directly from a computer aided drawing. This new manufacturing process
              can significantly reduce manufacturing costs, reduce the time from design to
              market, and improve the performance of components used in the die casting,
              injection molding, aircraft, and automotive industries. The overall objective
              of this CAREER project is to initiate an effort in interdisciplinary research
              and education in SFF using the LENS process. A research team of graduate
              students and faculty in the Materials and Mechanical Engineering Departments at
              Lehigh University and Lafayette College will collaborate with scientists at
              Sandia National Laboratory to develop LENS processing methods that can be used
              by industrial partners. Teaching modules in SFF will be developed by the
              faculty for undergraduate instruction in manufacturing as part of a capstone
              course that involves students from the engineering, business, and arts &
              sciences colleges at Lehigh University.

The final "products" of this program
              will be: 1) Processing methods that can be used by industry for improved
              control and consistency of the LENS manufacturing process, and 2) Graduate and
              undergraduate students with an improved understanding of the interdisciplinary
              approach required in today's modern manufacturing environment.
