Abstract    :
              The microscope has been a widely used tool of biological research for over two
              hundred years, but interest and developments in microscopy have waxed and waned
              over the years.  Extraordinary advances in genomics over the past few years,
              however, which have helped identify more physical components of cells and
              organisms thus creating a new challenge in determining how these parts function
              together as a living ensemble, have fueled a new demand for microscopy.  This
              project develops an integrated software suite that is used to capture, archive,
              visualize, analyze and distribute multifocal plane, time-lapse (4-D)
              microscopic recordings of embryonic development.  Advanced visualization aids
              including roaming space and time, 3-D rendering and arbitrary plane slicing
              facilitates perception of complex structural dynamics.  A comprehensive
              annotation system enables extensively labeled canonical developmental sequences
              to be established in a database thereby providing a powerful educational
              resource for students of embryology.
