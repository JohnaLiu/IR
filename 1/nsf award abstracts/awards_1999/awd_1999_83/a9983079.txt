Abstract    :
              Competition for light in plant stands causes size differences to develop among
              plants, even if they are of the same age and species.  However, preliminary
              research from the investigator's lab suggests that, under elevated CO2
              environments (predicted to occur in the future), these size differences might
              be reduced. Because larger plants often also produce more seed, the development
              of these size hierarchies affects which individuals successfully reproduce. 
              Thus, if there is any genetic influence on which plants become dominant, the
              effect of elevated CO2 on size structures in stands may also affect genetic or
              evolutionary change in a species.

The goals of this research are to
              determine the physiological, architectural and genetic bases for size hierarchy
              development, and to test whether elevated CO2 will help low-light subordinates
              "catch up".  To answer these questions, experimental populations of Ambrosia
              artemisiifolia will be grown in open-top chambers at two atmospheric CO2
              concentrations over two growing seasons.  Effects of elevated CO2 on light
              interception, leaf physiology, architecture, and reproductive output will be
              measured and modeled (1) to elucidate the dynamics of light competition and the
              development of size and fitness hierarchies in plant populations, and (2) to
              determine if elevated CO2 will reduce the importance of light competition in
              determining the relative fitness of individuals in future environments. In
              addition, because the study species (ragweed) is one of agronomic and public
              health concern, information from this study on its changing biology may have
              management implications.
