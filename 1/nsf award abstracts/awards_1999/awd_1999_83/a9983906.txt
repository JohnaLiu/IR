Abstract    :
                  Plants emit a wide range of hydrocarbons into the atmosphere.  These
              hydrocarbons have a complex atmospheric chemistry which can lead to ozone
              production in NOx polluted air, and to particle formation that leads to
              visibility-reducing haze.  A Gordon Research Conference has been organized to
              study plant hydrocarbon emissions, covering research areas ranging from
              biochemical pathways through ecosystem-level measurements and models of
              emissions.  This grant will support participation by early career scientists
              (students, post-docs, researchers, and assistant professors within five years
              of having obtained their Ph.D. or equivalent degree).
