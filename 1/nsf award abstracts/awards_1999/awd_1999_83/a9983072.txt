Abstract    :
              
We propose to identify factors that encourage SMET graduate students'
              participatioon in K-12 education and outreach, to provide opportunities for
              students that circumvent systemic barriers to participation, and to evaluate to
              potential benefits of this experience as a component of graduate
              education.

Currently, we have much anecdotal information about factors that
              discourage student involvement, including advisors' attitudes, time pressures,
              and student attitudes about the value of such experience in obtaining future
              jobs.  However, we do not have quantitative information about the relative
              importance of these and other factors.

This research builds on Dr. Andrew's
              experience as a PFSMETE fellow, takes advantage of  her position within a
              research university and a scientific research laboratory.  It addresses a
              well-defined question that has potentially important answers, and may lead to
              significant research in subsequent years.  The proposed plan also provides
              significant opportunities for Dr. Andrews' professional development as a
              science educator.
