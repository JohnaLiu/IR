Abstract    :
              Abstract:

The "Vertical integration of the mathematical sciences at UIC"
              project will provide students and postdoctoral fellows in the Department of
              Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science at the University of Illinois at
              Chicago with an educational and research experience which takes full advantage
              of both the scientific diversity of the Department and its affiliated
              laboratories and centers.  In addition the project will provide  oportunities
              for the students and fellows to work together on real world problems in the
              mathematical  sciences.  This program is being jointly funded by the Division
              of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Programs from the
              Directorate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences.
