Abstract    :
              This multidisciplinary project focuses on adapting and developing state-of-the
              art optical and biological tools and methods to study model membranes, with the
              goal of laying the groundwork for a systematic understanding of local
              structure-function relationships.  Initial studies will focus on the effect of
              curvature and domain formation on binding to and transport across model
              membranes.  Membrane curvature will be controlled by optical trapping,
              micropipet aspiration, polymerization of encapsulated tubulin, and/or
              supporting membranes on solid substrates having fixed curvature.  Curvature
              will be monitored by video-enhanced high-resolution differential interference
              contrast microscopy.  Binding and transport, as well and domain formation and
              reorganization, will be monitored using fluorescence microscopy and appropriate
              probes.  The award is jointly supported by the Physics Division, the Analytical
              and Surface Chemistry program, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
              in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Cellular Biology
              Program in the Biosciences Directorate.
