Summary

This project proposes to develop an information
              infrastructure that will greatly enhance access to a broad spectrum of
              ecological data resources at Arizona State University.  A suite of existing
              databases that inventory metadata, taxonomic data, and bibliographies will be
              cross-referenced and enhanced to support spatial queries and searches via
              national clearinghouses for geo-spatial, taxonomic and collections data. 
              Through development of a series of tools for automated processing of metadata
              and data, searches for primary datasets will be able to fluidly direct the user
              to online preview and query interfaces.  These tools will provide several key
              functions that leverage the power of metadata in automating data access,
              including simplifying metadata generation, metadata reporting and display,
              rapid application for data query, and simplifying data import and export over
              the Internet.  The use of open standards such as eXtensible Markup Language and
              Java and the modular approach to development taken by this project will ensure
              the flexibility that will allow rapid support for new datasets within the
              infrastructure and the development of interfaces that address the data needs of
              diverse target audiences.  Prototype applications that illustrate the use of
              these tools will be developed for three such audiences: academic research,
              education, and management.
