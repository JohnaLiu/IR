Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project will result in
              development of a novel oceanographic chlorophyll fluorescence sensor for the
              study of benthic microalgae.  This sensor will be the first to incorporate
              fluorescence lifetime measurement capability, and the first to implement such
              capability for stand-off measurements from an ROV. This is of major
              significance, because it will permit, for the first time, direct in situ
              measurements of fluorescence quantum yield, and hence of photochemical
              efficiency, a feat that is not possible with simple amplitude-based
              fluorimeters. Continental shelf benthic ecosystems are of critical importance
              to marine biology and the viability of these ecosystems can be objectively
              assessed from the
physiological status of the resident microalgae. The most
              important component of this status is the level of their photosynthetic
              performance, determined by the rates and efficiency of primary stages of
              light-driven photochemistry. Yet, knowledge about these processes, which
              control the health, long-term viability, productivity and dynamics of benthic
              microalgae is minimal because of the lack of suitable research tools for their
              study. Potential commercial applications include oceanographic sensors,
              precision farming, photosynthesis analyzers for the laboratory research market,
              non-invasive brain oxymetry, product authentication, High Throughput Screening,
              clinical in vitro diagnostics and on-line process analysis.
