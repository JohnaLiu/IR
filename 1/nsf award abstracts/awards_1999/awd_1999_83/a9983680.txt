Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to develop methodology for the enantioselective
              addition of nitrogen nucleophiles to enamides and alkylidene malonate using
              catalytic amounts of chiral Lewis acids.  Further, a complementary chiral Lewis
              acid-mediated protocol in which carbon nucleophiles add selectively to
              N-substituted methylidene malonates will be developed.  The resulting
              methodology will be used for the preparation indolizidine and pyrrolizidine
              alkaloids with biological activity.

With this award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Mukund Sibi
              of the Department of Chemistry at North Dakota State University.   Professor
              Sibi will develop new methodology for the preparation of optically active
              beta-amino acids.  The research could have broader impact in the synthesis of
              compounds and materials of interest to the pharmaceutical and agricultural
              industries.
