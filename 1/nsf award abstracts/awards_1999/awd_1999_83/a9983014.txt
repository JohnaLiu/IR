Tropical deforestation creates areas cleared of all trees
              and small, remnant patches of trees.  Such forest fragments become refuges and
              the only source of future populations in a deforested landscape.  The goal of
              this research is to determine if forest fragmentation causes changes in the
              movement of genes (gene flow) in tropical tree populations that may lead to
              loss of genetic diversity and increased extinction risk.  This study will
              utilize experimental forest fragments at the Biological Dynamics of Forest
              Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil and a canopy tree in the Brazil nut
              family, Corythophora alta, as a model species.  Using nuclear and chloroplast
              DNA genetic markers to estimate pollen and seed movement, this study seeks to
              compare genetic organization and gene flow patterns of tree populations in
              undisturbed forest and fragmented forest.

This research will estimate the
              impact of present-day tropical forest destruction on the genetic base of future
              forest populations that will inhabit geographically restricted areas.  The
              results will give insights into the future genetic condition of degraded
              natural habitats, genetic information for biological reserve design and
              agroforestry projects, and a better understanding of the evolutionary genetics
              of tropical trees.  The ultimate goal of this work is to estimate potential
              genetic impacts of fragmentation in order to prevent genetic erosion in
              species-rich Amazonian forests.
