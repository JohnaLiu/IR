TITLE:	CAREER: Towards Estimating
              Requirements Coverage:
	Managing Scenarios and Goals During Requirements
              Evolution

PI:	Ana (Annie) I. Anton


The career development planned
              outlined in this proposal focuses on the
principal investigator's efforts to
              integrate core research and educational
objectives.  The research addresses
              important issues in the discovery,
elaboration and management of system use
              scenarios for the specification of
software requirements.  The ultimate goal
              is to develop viable solutions
for supporting the early stages of the software
              lifecycle by ensuring
requirements coverage. The objective is to produce a
              framework, and
web-based tool support, to enable the evaluation of
              requirements activities
and processes during scenario management and evolution
              as well as
requirements coverage estimation. The web-based tool will serve as
              an
experimental research engine, collecting data on requirements
              engineering
activities in a series of projects for real clients in various
              domains,
sites and project teams.

The educational component is closely
              related to the research plan.
Students, at the undergraduate and graduate
              level, as well as industrial
participants, will use the software produced
              during the research
activities. The results of this research are expected to
              improve the
outcome of projects that employ goal and scenario-based approaches
              during
requirements specification.  A library of projects in various domains
              will
lead to new materials such as techniques, methods and cases for
              software
engineering education.
