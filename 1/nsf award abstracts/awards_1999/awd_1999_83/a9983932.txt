Abstract    :
              This is the first year of funding of a 4 year continuing award. The goal of this
              project is to help machine learning make the leap from today's one shot,
              standalone applications to the ubiquitous, continuously functioning, seamlessly
              integrated web of learning systems of the future. The work will focus on four
              thrusts that are necessary to bring this about: (a) Scaling up machine learning
              algorithms so they can be applied to very large databases, and developing
              intrinsically scalable new algorithms; (b) Increasing the autonomy of learning
              systems through the use of automated data integration and improved overfitting
              avoidance; (c)Enabling learning systems to handle, data from heterogeneous
              sources and with different types of structure, such as the World Wide Web; (d)
              Educating a new generation of scientists to take advantage of the methodologies
              and tools provided by machine learning. If successful, the proposed work will
              lead to an order of magnitude or more increase in the size of databases to
              which machine learning algorithms can be usefully applied, to a significant
              reduction in the level of expertise required to develop and deploy a learning
              system, to learning systems that are able to function in environments of a
              greater  variety and complexity than is currently the case, and to a new crop
              of scientists who are able to perform analyses that are currently beyond their
              reach with corresponding increase in the potential fornew discoveries and
              innovations.
