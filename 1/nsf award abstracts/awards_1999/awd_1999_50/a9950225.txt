Abstract    :
              Both the classroom and laboratory portions of this course in recombinant DNA
              technology are designed to promote contextual, collaborative, inquiry-based
              learning of science.  Students teach one another and have a sense of ownership
              of their education. In class, emphasis is on group presentations and critical
              reading and discussion of scientific articles that use recombinant DNA
              technology to address questions in both basic and applied research. In the
              laboratory, investigative projects are designed to help students pose and
              answer two questions: 1) How do you clone a gene? and 2) And so then what do
              you do with it? The two projects are random DNA cloning, and in vitro
              expression and site-directed mutagenesis of cholinesterase; the latter project
              integrates the research and teaching of the principal investigator. Students
              present the results of their two laboratory projects in a poster and in a paper
              with the format of a scientific article. It adapts principals found in Project
              Kaleidoscope (1991, What works: building natural science communities  Volume
              one) and the PEW Higher Education Collaborative (1998, Policy perspectives
              sponsored by the PEW science program in undergraduate education.  University of
              Pennsylvania, Phila. PA), and the work of Brian Coppola (1997, J. Chem Ed. 74,
              74-83 and 84-94) and the Council on Undergraduate Research (1995, CUR Quarterly
              16, 109-114).
