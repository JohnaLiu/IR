Abstract    :
              
The Plastics Resources for Educators Program (PREP) is establishing the
              educational infrastructure necessary for ensuring that the U.S. plastics
              industry remains internationally competitive. Today, plastics manufacturing
              represents the nation's fourth largest and the fastest growing industry (10
              percent a year) with a need for an additional 250,000 plastics technicians /
              engineers by the year 2005.

PREP is a consortium between two primary
              institutions: The Pennsylvania College of Technology (Penn College) and The
              Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). There are also 3 other "support"
              institutions providing project input to the PREP initiative. PREP has an
              established industry advisory board and an independent evaluation team headed
              by Dr. Gordon McCarty of Bayer.

There are three primary outcomes of PREP.
              The first is the definition, maintenance, and contributions to the PREP
              Bookshelf. The PREP Bookshelf is a warehouse of instructional materials for use
              in plastics technology education. The second outcome is the development of a
              National Plastics Forum. Through development of the PREP website, a LISTSERVE,
              NetMeeting capability, and annual workshops the project is helping to keep
              faculty continually interfacing for the solution of common problems. The last
              outcome is better pre-college outreach through collaboration with project
              partners.
