Abstract    :
              This project addresses the introduction of computers into the undergraduate
              chemistry laboratory for the purpose of enhancing the chemical education of
              students pursuing degrees in biological and biochemical fields of study. The
              introduction of computers to the labs is accomplished through the adaptation
              and implementation of the LabWorks II SCI interface system for chemistry
              (NSF-DUE 9156101). The SCI interface is well described as a successful tool in
              undergraduate chemistry laboratories. Additionally, some of the results from
              LabVIEW Software (NSF-DUE 9251226) are adapted. Several of current experiments
              in our chemistry courses as well as some in bioorganic, biochemistry, and
              biology have been revised for the inclusion of this instrumentation. The
              computers in the labs are also used in tutorial sessions to help students
              visualize some of the more complex structures and mechanisms.  This is
              accomplished through the adaptation C-MoR, a software developed at University
              of Richmond  (Myers, H., Southeast Regional Meeting, American Chemical Society,
              Research Triangle Park, NC, Nov. 4-7, 1998, Abstract 183). The anticipated
              outcome of this project is that the implementation of computer aided chemistry
              improves the students' performance and ignites more interest in science.
