Abstract    :
              This project will use modem pedagogical methods and computer data acquisition
              technology to improve biology education at Goshen College. Goshen College has a
              reputation for strong science programs, but the current curriculum is weak in
              the area of modem physiology. This project will develop a large number of
              inquiry-type physiology lab exercises. Students, working in groups, will
              develop a hypothesis, design a way to test it, collect appropriate data, and
              present the data. In these exercises, students will develop a range of
              analytical and collaborative skills. Appropriate concepts and laboratory
              techniques will be embedded in the process.

This proposal requests funding
              for equipment, personnel time, and related costs to effect these changes.
              Goshen College will match the amount requested. The equipment will provide
              capability for computer data acquisition and access to data analysis and
              presentation tools. The project will focus on student work in laboratories of
              two classes: (I)Vertebrate Physiology; and (2)Human Anatomy and Physiology.
              Many of the key exercises in these classes will be adapted from work previously
              funded by the NSF. Students will make more limited but significant use of the
              equipment in courses in Health, Biological Principles, and Physiological
              Psychology.

The new inquiry activities will be offered in the 1999-2000
              academic year, involving 200 students. Revised activities, final assessment and
              dissemination of results will occur in the 20002001 academic year. Student work
              will be evaluated by regular oral and written reports. An independent evaluator
              will review student work at the beginning and end of each semester. Evaluations
              will focus on student's quantitative, analytical, and collaborative skills, and
              on their communication of experimental data. Laboratory exercises and examples
              of student work will be posted on the web, and presented at local and national
              conferences.
