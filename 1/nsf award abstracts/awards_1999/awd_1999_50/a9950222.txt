Abstract    :
              This project strengthens Civil Engineering courses in structures by combining
              problem-based learning and hands-on experiences to expose students to realistic
              design and analysis challenges.   The implementation at the University of
              Puerto Rico - Mayaguez is based on two adaptations.  First, the problem based
              learning approach is adapted from work at McMaster University, MIT, Dartmouth
              College, and other universities.  Second, the hands-on approach is adapted from
              the Mechanical Dissection work at Tuskegee University, as well as similar
              efforts at Purdue University, Cornell University, and other schools.

The
              main objectives of the project are: 1) to modify the current undergraduate
              structural engineering courses to incorporate skills such as teamwork, critical
              thinking, and real-world applications; 2) to enhance each student's ability to
              use the techniques, skills, and tools necessary for the future
              multidisciplinary environment of engineering practice; 3) to complement the
              civil engineering department's plan to develop its current curriculum to meet
              accreditation criteria.  The following two tasks are being completed:
              development of a workbench for undergraduate structural testing applications,
              and the incorporation of the hands-on learning technique in current
              courses.
