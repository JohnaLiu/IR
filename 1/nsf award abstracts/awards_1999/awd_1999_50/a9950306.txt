Abstract    :
              This project delivers undergraduate instruction in the area of digital signal
              processing (DSP) with applications to digital filtering, control,
              communication, and power systems. It is intended to bring the rapidly advancing
              DSP technologies into the signals and systems course, control systems course,
              communication systems course, and the senior design projects course, currently
              being taught at Alfred University without laboratory experiments using the
              latest DSP technologies. Based on industry expectations, students need a better
              understanding of the fundamental principles of signals and systems, control
              systems, and communication systems, and the new DSP technologies. The requested
              funding supports the purchase of software and hardware development tool and
              three spectrum analyzers. This purchase complements equipment on hand including
              six TMS320C31 DSK Starter Kits, one set of the TMS320C30 software and hardware
              development tools, six Pentium 300 PCs, five speed/position control systems,
              one communication workstation, MATLAB, oscilloscopes, and function generators.
              All equipment supports the students in various experiments including IIR
              (infinite impulse response) and FIR (finite-duration impulse response) filters,
              FFT, MATLAB interface, digital controllers, echo cancelers and adaptive
              filters, a serial voice communication link, and senior design projects. In
              addition, the laboratory is to be used for demonstrations for visiting high
              school students on the annual Open House in Spring, Summer Institute in July,
              and Engineering and Science Day in October, at Alfred University.
