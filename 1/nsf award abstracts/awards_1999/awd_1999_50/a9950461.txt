Abstract    :
              The Romberg Tiburon Center for Environment Studies (RTC) is a rapidly growing
              off-campus teaching and research center of San Francisco State University. 
              Undergraduate presence at the center is increasing due to greater interest from
              faculty, and improved curriculum and teaching facilities, both at RTC and on
              the main campus 35 minutes away.  While RTC has much state-of-the-art research
              equipment, the center lacked an appropriate computer technology component
              needed to implement both traditional and newly available environmental science
              curricula.  In order to correct this problem, our project develops and supports
              an up-to-date Instructional Environmental Science Computer Lab, and creates new
              curricula that makes use of the Lab.  New curricula being implemented includes
              ecological and environmental modeling and analysis modules employing Structural
              Thinking, Experiential Learning Laboratory with Animation (STELLA), MATLab, and
              SYSTAT statistics software plus the ERDAS Imagine image-processing system. 
              Combined with current RTC equipment this support provides RTC with a modern
              computer lab with 123 computers plus essential peripherals.  The project is
              adapted from elements of STELLA software and from the problem-solving text,
              "Consider a Spherical Cow" by John Harte.
