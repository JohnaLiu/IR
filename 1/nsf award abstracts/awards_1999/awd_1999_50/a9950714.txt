Abstract    :
              This project is developing three categories of educational materials, all based
              on the Java Programming Language -- (1) self-contained, versatile, mathematical
              activities, available over the Internet for use by individual students or by
              university or high school mathematics classes, (2) mathematically oriented Java
              programming tools (JavaBeans) to aid mathematics instructors in creating their
              own mathematics activities using Java, and (3) a series of tutorials, available
              over the Internet, to give mathematics instructors sufficient training in Java
              programming to develop their own mathematical activities with the help of a
              visual programming environment and the tools described above.

The project is
              proceeding in three stages. In the summer of 1999, develop and refine Java
              programming tools along with sample activities and a series of tutorials. In
              the summer of 2000, a workshop for twenty mathematics faculty members  on the
              use of the Java Programming tools and development of their own mathematics
              activities. These workshop participants continue developing activities
              throughout the year so that they may be displayed at a conference in the summer
              of 2001 open to the mathematical community to publicize the activities to
              mathematics faculty in the region. A web server devoted to this project houses
              the activities, Java language tutorials, and the programming tools.
