Abstract    :
              This project provides materials and resources enabling universities nationwide
              to reproduce and customize a program on communication training recently
              developed at the Cooper Union in New York City. Primarily the project produces
              a Communication Training Handbook supported by Video Modules. These products
              are to be available in shortened form on a website and as downloadable
              files.

The communication program, known as CONNECT, consists of a series of
              intensive, experiential workshops that deal with fundamental issues and then
              transitions into a menu of advanced topics and professional engineering
              scenarios. The workshops are complemented by a series of seminars in graphical
              communications and workplace, entrepreneurial or international issues. The
              program has been in development since 1994 and was expanded to the whole
              engineering school in 1997.  It is administered by the engineering school and
              linked to specific courses, thereby, integrating it into the curriculum.
