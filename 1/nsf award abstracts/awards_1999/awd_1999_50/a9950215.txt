Abstract    :
              In an approach adapted from materials presented by Catherine Mader of Hope
              College (Building and Sustaining an Undergraduate Research Program) and Louise
              Temple of Drew University and Brian Merkle of University of Wisconsin Green Bay
              (How to Survive as a Researcher in a Small Liberal Arts College) at the 1998
              Project Kaleidoscope National Assembly and a small pilot project, students are
              using a research project approach to learning biology.  Students are sharpening
              their scientific reasoning and analytical skills by designing and conducting
              research experiments utilizing sophisticated techniques for gene expression
              (tissue cryosectioning, immunocytochemistry, enzyme cytochemistry, and in situ
              hybridization).  A number of courses are affected.  Developmental Biology
              students are: designing experiments to analyze the tissue-specific expressions
              of a gene during embryogenesis; performing labeling experiments for
              visualization of this expression in embryo sections; recording and analyzing
              their data using an image analysis station; and disseminating their scientific
              data at a student poster session at the end of the semester.  Cell Biology
              students perform similar laboratory projects involving enzyme cytochemistry. 
              Molecular Biology, Immunology, Microscopic Anatomy and Molecular Genetics
              courses are also adapting the new approach and implementing use of the new
              equipment.
