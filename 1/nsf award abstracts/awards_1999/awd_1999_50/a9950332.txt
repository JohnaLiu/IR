Abstract    :
              Using modern instrumentation biochemistry students form research teams to purify
              and investigate specific enzymes.  Extensive faculty consultation is involved
              to help students plan and continually revise their protocols and final reports.
               A pilot testing of this approach served as the basis for design of this
              course.  The course is part of a department commitment to change the way in
              which biology is taught to all students.  The new department curriculum adapts
              and implements ideas from a variety of sources, including work cited by the
              National Research Council (1997, Science Teaching Reconsidered), the Council on
              Undergraduate Research (CUR Newsletter 1997) and previous pilot projects  of
              the Principal Investigator (Mayne, J. 1998 An Investigative Laboratory for Cell
              Biology, Molecular Biology of the Cell, 9).
