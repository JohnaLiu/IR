Abstract    :
              A gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer and an ion chromatograph are facilitating
              the development of a new introductory general chemistry course at Bates
              College.  The two-semester course relates fundamental chemical concepts to the
              study of the environment.   The sequence satisfies the general chemistry
              prerequisite for all upper-level chemistry courses and the chemistry
              requirement for the B.S. degree.  The course is specifically designed to
              emphasize the process involved in conducting scientific investigations.  In the
              class, collaborative learning methods, the effectiveness of which has been
              demonstrated in funded projects NSF-DUE 9450615 and NSF-DUE 9354606, are
              adapted and implemented.  In the lab, students undertake projects that
              demonstrate the problem-solving nature of scientific investigations.  

The
              need for problem-based learning was the central recommendation in a recent
              NSF-sponsored report entitled Curricular Developments in the Analytical
              Sciences.  In the first semester, environmental analyses from the literature
              that utilize gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or ion chromatography are
              adapted into problem-based laboratory exercises.  In the second semester,
              students monitor the chemical constituents in a marine aquarium, an adaptation
              and implementation of a successful set of exercises developed in NSF-DUE
              9354530.  Working in teams, the students have considerable autonomy over the
              design and execution of the investigations. The various group activities give
              students experience working with others in a professional setting.
