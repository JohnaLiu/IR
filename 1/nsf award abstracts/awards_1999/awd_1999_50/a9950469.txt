Abstract    :
              This is a proof of concept project to develop a web-based technical course with
              a laboratory component for the Manufacturing Engineering Technology Program.
              The course is also practical for presentation in an interactive television
              format. A team of faculty and the Project Director for the Southwest Center for
              Advanced Technological Education is developing the project and assisting a team
              of students in implementing the project plan. A manufacturing work cell is
              being installed with a video camera positioned to view the production of a
              part. Students can program the work cell from a computer at a distant site and
              view the production process on their personal computers. The instructor
              evaluates the part produced and the program used in the manufacturing process
              and provides feedback to each student. The technical course with the laboratory
              component is being tested at three pilot sites, evaluated by students and the
              faculty team. Results will be disseminated to community and technical colleges.
