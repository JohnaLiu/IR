Abstract    :
              Highly interactive, computer-based learning aids for students taking mechanics
              of materials courses are under development.  These learning aides, in the form
              of courseware, focus directly on the refinement of students' abilities to solve
              problems. Subjects covered include shear and bending moment diagrams, beam
              deflection, internal torques and rotations, internal loads and stresses in
              three-dimensions, stress transformations, and axial loading of bars.  A  set of
              fundamental analysis skills critical to success in the topic forms the basis
              for each module. Computer exercises that (i) review the relevant theory, (ii)
              give step-by-step instruction as to solving relevant types of problems and
              (iii) invite students to actually solve such problems constitute each module. 
              In the problem solving mode, the modules of the courseware offer immediate
              feedback, as well as help and hint on an as-needed basis. Since the modules
              generate new problems ad infinitum, students can work with the material as long
              as necessary for mastery.   Because the courseware will also set up log files,
              students can complete assignments as convenient and submit them electronically.
              This courseware is compatible with any Windows-based platform requiring minimal
              memory and storage, facilitating easy integration into existing mechanics of
              materials courses.
