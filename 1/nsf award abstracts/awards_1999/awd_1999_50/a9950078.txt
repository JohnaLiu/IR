Abstract    :
              The College of Technology, a consortium of engineering technology and technology
              studies curricula of the community and technical colleges in Connecticut, plans
              the development and implementation of an Introduction to Engineering course for
              the system colleges and a high school engineering course.  The consortium
              investigates and builds upon best practices in ATE projects and centers and
              elsewhere. Consortium teams meet with representatives from industry, four-year
              colleges and high schools to determine industry needs and to develop evaluation
              of competencies.  Professional development for faculty includes industrial
              experiences and understanding new pedagogical strategies valued by industry and
              academic institutions.  The project builds the awareness and dissemination of
              the ATE program.
