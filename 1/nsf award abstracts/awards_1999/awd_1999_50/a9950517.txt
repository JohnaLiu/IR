Abstract    :
              The largest and most frequently visited Internet site for the discipline of
              Social Psychology is Social Psychology Network (SPN), a site founded in 1996
              and maintained at Wesleyan University. SPN will be developed in six key ways:
              (1) a bulletin board service will be added to provide open discussion forums
              and links to moderated email list servers maintained by leading social
              psychology societies; (2) SPN will be moved from the Wesleyan University web
              server to its own web server; (3) the number of reciprocal links between SPN
              and other web sites will be increased, both to build web traffic to SPN and to
              connect disparate electronic resources within psychology; (4) the coverage of
              certain content areas within SPN will be significantly expanded; (5) the
              appearance and general layout of SPN will be improved with an eye toward ease
              of navigation as well as stability across different types of computers and web
              browsers; and (6) Research Randomizer, an SPN research tool for random sampling
              and random assignment, will be further developed and publicized. With these
              improvements and extensions, SPN will support teaching, training, and learning
              in social psychology, and it will create an infrastructure for greater
              networking, partnerships, access to resources, and the advancement of knowledge
              in psychological science. The uniform resource locator (URL) for the SPN web
              site is http://www.wesleyan.edu/spn.
