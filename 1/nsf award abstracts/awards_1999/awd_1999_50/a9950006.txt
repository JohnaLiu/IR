Abstract    :
              This program will combine the resources of a major international center for
              quantum optics and technology with a successful collaboration of two-year
              college faculty members who have developed and administered an effective
              national faculty development program for two-year college physics faculty over
              the past eight years. The project will engage 40 two-year college faculty
              members employed in the academic preparation of science and engineering
              technicians throughout the US, in a two year long program of annual two week
              institutes and semi-annual academic year follow-up workshops. Participants will
              receive a combination of tutorials on recent discoveries in quantum optics,
              hands-on experience with the new tools of this recent technology in the
              laboratories of the research center and the pedagogical training in active
              learning techniques designed to maximize student understanding of the
              scientific principles which provide the foundation for these emerging
              technologies.
