The University of Southern Mississippi, in collaboration
              with the Chemical Heritage Foundation and the University of Wisconsin-Stevens
              Point, develops multimedia for polymer science education.  The project includes
              four components: extension of multimedia material for basic and advanced
              courses in polymer science (Macrogalleria and Polymer Expeditions), development
              of new multimedia material for polymer laboratory (Macrolab), integration of
              the multimedia materials into a two-semester undergraduate course, and
              workshops for material dissemination and to acquaint college instructors with
              its use.  The material includes real-world references and examples of the
              principles introduced.

The multimedia material developed in this project can
              be readily incorporated into existing science courses by instructors with
              little or no experience in polymers, and as such has potentially widespread
              applications.  Introduction of scientific information by relating it to objects
              that directly impact our lives helps the student learn and understand better,
              plus gives them insight into why basic science is vital to our world.
