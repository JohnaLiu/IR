Abstract    :
              The Division of Mathematics has reflected the national trend toward integrating
              computing technology into its instruction, but to date that has been limited to
              hand-held graphing calculators. In order to implement further curricular
              changes our students must have access to desktop personal computers running
              mathematical software. This project implements a computer laboratory for
              classroom instruction and student use in differential equations and statistics.
              By adapting and implementing materials and practices from projects including
              the work on differential equations by Blanchard, Devaney, Coleman, Borelli and
              others and the work on statistics by  Rossman, Schaeffer and others, these
              courses enhance instruction and broaden student activities to include work on
              computationally intensive real world problems. Although the initial focus is on
              two specific subject areas, we intend to extend the impact of the laboratory to
              other mathematics areas such as linear algebra and operations research.
