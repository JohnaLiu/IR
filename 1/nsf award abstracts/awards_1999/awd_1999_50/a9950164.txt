Abstract    :
              The project is developing materials for multivaraible calculus that use modern
              computing to help students learn and apply this material to a  variety of
              science and engineering disciplines, as well as other areas of mathematics. 
              The project is developing a prototype of these materials to establish a 'proof
              of concept.'  Ultimately the materials are expected to consist of three parts:
              1) live electronic text that resides in the Mathematics Help Browser, 2)
              printed text of basic material taken from core of live version, and 3) web
              browser version that uses a remote server to perform computations.   These
              materials are expected to be accessible to students after only one semester of
              calculus.
