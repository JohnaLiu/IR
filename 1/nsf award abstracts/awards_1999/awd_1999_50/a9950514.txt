Abstract    :
              Improving science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) education is
              central to shaping America's future.  In this project, multimedia courseware
              using the case study methodology is under development.  This methodology
              illustrates the links between SMET courses and real-world engineering and
              technological issues.  The courseware is being customized for use in freshman
              engineering classes, minority introduction to engineering programs, current and
              prospective high school mathematics and science teacher preparation programs,
              and introductory level business classes.  In addition to the testing in
              classrooms at Auburn University and at three other universities, the
              courseware's effectiveness is being evaluated using an outcomes based model as
              well as through comparative evaluations of control groups.  The multimedia
              courseware is intended to offer synchronous and asynchronous learning
              opportunities for students majoring in engineering, teacher preparation, and
              business.
