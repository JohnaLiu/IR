Abstract    :
              The products from this project include: 1) the Biology Student Workbench, an
              educational front-end to the powerful suite of bioinformatics tools comprising
              the Biology Workbench,; and 2) a set of  inquiry-based curricular materials
              based on use of the workbench.  The Biology Student Workbench brings the
              advanced computational infrastructure used by today's scientists to any student
              desktop machine with a web browser. The basis of this new tool for
              undergraduate students and faculty, the Biology Workbench
              (http://bioweb.ncsa.uiuc.edu/), provides researchers a suite of interactive
              tools based on a number of biology databases including: sequence
              bioinformatics; computational studies of biological membranes; a database of
              neuronal pattern analysis; and a computational environment for studying ion
              movement in biological systems.  The site has been used to: compare molecular
              sequences; visualize and manipulate molecular structures; and generate
              phylogenetic hypotheses (Kaiser, 1998).   This access to a multiplicity of
              research analysis tools and data sources provides a rich environment for
              promoting student inquiry as exemplified by the eight curricular modules
              developed for student use:  biodiversity/conservation, genology/phylogeny,
              molecular basis for disease, drug design, phylogenetic probes, environmental
              remediation, developmental biology, and agricultural applications.
