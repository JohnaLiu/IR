Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is the adaptation and implementation of an
              eight-station, personal computer-based, instrumentation course. 
              

Instrumentation, previously developed at Stanford and Drexel Universities,
              is to be adapted to corresponding courses at Old Dominion University ODU.  The
              instrumentation for one ODU course, ECE 458, is being adapted from a similar
              course called computer interfacing, developed in the Mechanical Engineering
              Department at Stanford University.  The ODU students are to learn a graphical
              programming language (i.e., LabVIEW) that is then utilized to develop
              customized or virtual instruments. With the use of these virtual instruments
              they make measurements of physical quantities such as temperature, pressure,
              voltage, etc., using sensors.  The sensors are connected to the computer,
              through data acquisition cards and/or digital instruments.  The students can
              also control external devices, using digital-to- analog converters, and hence
              develop a complete "system".  

The second course, being adapted to the ODU
              setting, is the E4 Introductory Engineering, Test, Design, and Simulation
              Laboratory, developed at Drexel.  This Drexel course is aimed at the retention
              of freshman engineering students, and the equipment, the structure, and the
              course content, is to be adapted to a similar course at ODU, i.e., ENGN 110 -
              111.  The ODU course is a two-credit, two-semester course, required of all
              engineering students, during their freshman year.  The object is to get them
              excited by getting involved in realistic engineering projects.  The LabVIEW -PC
              based instrumentation enables students at the freshman level to get involved in
              significant and interesting engineering projects, without much of the tedium
              that would have been necessary even a few years ago.
