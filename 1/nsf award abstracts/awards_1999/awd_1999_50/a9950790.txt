Abstract    :
              An API 300 Micro Flow Auto Analyzer System has been adapted from advice from and
              involvement with  the Center for Applied Aquatic Science and
              Aquaculture/National Science Foundation program in Stressed Stream Analysis. 
              This equipment allows us to enhance a faculty and student project, Water
              Quality in the Congaree River.  Earlier work was time-intensive nutrient
              testing for nitrate and phosphate.  Previously this work had been carried out
              by Environmental Assessment students and by geoscience majors with related
              independent studies. The API 300 Micro Flow Auto Analyzer System with its
              simple flow through cell allows a sampling rate of 90-120 samples per hour, and
              the included software package allows fast, efficient analyses which are
              appropriate features for exposing both non-science and science majors to modern
              technology and field- based research.   Majors are acquiring valuable
              experience in the standard techniques in this field. This equipment also makes
              it possible to offer multiple sections of Environmental Assessment (mainly
              non-majors) and Stressed Stream Analysis (majors). The auto analyzer increases
              the frequency of sampling and size of the sampling area, improves the research
              component in courses and the validity of results, and makes possible the
              addition of new test sites in the watershed,   The department is equipped with
              computer technology that can be interfaced with the API Analyzer for rapid
              graphical displays.
