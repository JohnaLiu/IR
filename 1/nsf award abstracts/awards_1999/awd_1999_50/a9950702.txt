Abstract    :
              This proposal outlines a project to develop and test a series of web-based
              tutorials in quantum mechanics (theory and applications) for use in conjunction
              with more standard textbook materials in the core, junior-senior level quantum
              theory courses taught at colleges and universities. A set of 3-4 such modules
              would be produced as part of an initial 'proof of concept' funding period on
              topics from the areas Modern Physical Systems, 'Classic' Quantum Systems and
              Experiments, Mathematical Methods, and Visualization of Quantum Phenomena.
              These new web-based materials would include a wide variety of conceptual,
              analytic, and numerical questions and problems which would allow students to
              test, refine and further explore (via homework and linked references) the
              information presented in the modules. They would also be keyed to and
              coordinated with a wide variety of existing textbooks in order to provide
              instructors with the ability to tailor their courses to meet the needs and
              interests of individual students. Students making use of these materials would
              be introduced to modern applications of quantum mechanics in novel scientific
              and technological systems, classic experimental tests that form the
              underpinning of quantum theory, and modern mathematical methods, expanding and
              extending on material found in the standard curriculum. Although intended
              mostly for advanced undergraduates, these materials would be tested on
              sophomore level students taking modern physics courses as well as first year
              graduate students in order to probe pedagogical questions such as how student
              understanding of quantum mechanics concepts develops over the undergraduate
              career, how web-based materials are used by students at different stages of
              their development, and how increasingly more sophisticated material (which may
              require students to work on homework exercises for longer periods of time) is
              utilized by students in the context of web delivery.
