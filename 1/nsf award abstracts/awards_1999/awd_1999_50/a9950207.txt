Abstract    :
              This project is developing materials to provide a "gateway" into
              microelectronics for first year university and community college students.  The
              project uses two sets of tools -- virtual experiments (that is, computer-based
              simulations) and a novel set of real-life laboratory modules.  Virtual
              experiments provide students with visual representations of objects and
              processes that they can manipulate.  Some virtual experiments describe the
              laboratory modules and others provide experience with manipulable (virtual)
              microelectronic devices.  Both virtual and real-life experimments emphasize the
              acquisition of knowledge by doing.  We hope to guide students toward an
              understanding of underlying principles without the need for complex
              mathematical or other prerequisites.

Materials will be combined in different
              ways to suit varied educational needs and interests.  Software "Gateway
              Applets" will provide a layered introduction to the field, allowing a students
              to "tear apart" a computer to reveal circuits, chips, and embedded
              microelectronic devices.  A stand-alone self-guided tour will be available via
              the Web for anyone curious about "those mysterious chips."  On-campus, software
              and hardware experiments will be used in "drop-in" modules incorporated into
              several existing courses or used in new courses.

The materials are being
              developed by a team with extensive microelectronis and software experience and
              are being tested at community college and university campuses.
