Abstract    :
              The Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analyzer has allowed us to continue to build
              on our inquiry-based foundation adapted from the coursework and research of
              Baldwin 1970,1972; Manley and Manley 1997; and Coish, 1998.  The instrument was
              adapted based on its accuracy compared to other methods of particle size
              analysis (e.g. pipette and hydrometer methods), and also its ability to rapidly
              analyze numerous samples over a wide range of particle size.   As a result we
              have improved:  1) our curriculum in the environmental geochemistry,
              geomorphology, marine geology, environmental geology and hydrology courses,  2)
               the laboratory component of the introductory environmental science course, 3)
              opportunities for undergraduate research, and 4) research opportunities for
              students and faculty from nearby colleges and universities.  
We have combined
              laser particle size analysis with existing instrumental resources (e.g., XRD,
              ICP, SEM-EDS) and field-based resources to create an interdisciplinary approach
              to surficial and environmental geology.  Students using hands-on now have the
              opportunity to practice critical thinking, investigate their own hypotheses,
              and experience where they can apply and hone important analytical skills. 
We
              are offering a short course for faculty from regional colleges interested in
              applying laser particle size analysis to student and faculty research.  This
              short course emphasizes applications of particle size analysis to geology, soil
              science and environmental science allowing for faculty enhancement and access
              by students from regional colleges for use in their research projects.
