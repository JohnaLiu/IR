Abstract    :
              The University in collaboration with the University of Alabama and Duke
              University, seeks to enhance student learning of calculus and higher
              mathematics with funding under the Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory
              Improvement, Track 2 (CCLI-A&I). This project addresses three specific problems
              in GSCC's calculus sequence: (1) limited lab facilities, (2) low success rates
              in Calculus I, and (3) low persistence rates in the calculus series.

The
              project goal is to make calculus more accessible to students and to ensure
              their persistence through the sequence with a successful completion. The
              project objectives are: (1) to achieve a 10% increase in success and
              persistence rates in the calculus sequence, targeting women and minorities and
              math education majors through exceptional learning techniques, materials, and
              activities; (2) to establish collaboration with the local magnet high school
              and two universities for professional development of high school and college
              faculty; and (3) to create an effective learning atmosphere with a calculus
              lab/classroom equipped with Maple software, presentation equipment and
              software, and workstations arranged so that students can work in pairs and/or
              groups of four on collaborative activities with or without the assistance of
              technology.

Activities consist of the following: (1) focusing on two
              sections of Calculus I each semester, with classes meeting at least once a week
              in the calculus lab/classroom and making the lab accessible for completing or
              enhancing assignments outside of class; (2) faculty development with Duke
              University and the University of Alabama consultants, adapting and implementing
              calculus "reform" activities and effective use of Maple software; (3)
              collaboration with Litchfield High School, a local magnet school, in the
              development of effective materials, techniques, and activities and by hosting a
              summer calculus enrichment program for incoming Litchfield graduates in
              pre-calculus and calculus.
