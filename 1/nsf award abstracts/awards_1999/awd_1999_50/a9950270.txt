Abstract    :
              This project  adapts and incorporates modern analytical techniques into the
              Animal and Food Science undergraduate curriculum by establishing an
              undergraduate student instrumental analysis laboratory course with a focus on
              foods.  Experiments included represent adaptation and implementation of
              exemplary practices gleaned from the Principal Investigator's survey of major
              Food Science Departments across the United States.  Emphasis in the laboratory
              is on understanding: the operational principles and theory of current
              instrumentation; the differences and similarities of analyzing a sample by
              various instrumental methods; and learning to critically evaluate, interpret,
              compare, and effectively communicate results.  A laboratory manual is being
              developed and disseminated.
