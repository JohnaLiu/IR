Abstract    :
              This project is developing a networked computer facility for instruction,
              student research, and technology training.  It is leading to improved
              psychology courses and laboratories in cognition, sensation and perception,
              test and measurement, and physiological psychology. This facility has been
              designed to provide opportunities for enhanced student understanding of
              concepts and research methodology through direct experience, expanded student
              and faculty research possibilities, and training in technology as an
              information source, a research tool, and a communication tool. 

The
              instructional facility is being equipped with 17 Apple Power Mac G3 computers
              with Pentium processors.  This choice of equipment will allow the operation of
              both Macintosh and MS-DOS/ Windows based software. This facility is being
              equipped with a variety of educational psychology software.  In particular, we
              are implementing a package of 15 experiments that have been developed for
              undergraduate use in Cognition and Perception, running on an MS-DOS platform,
              and a package of landmark experiments in Memory and Cognition running on the
              Macintosh Operating System platform.  

This enhancement of our facilities
              and the implementation of technology into our curriculum is leading to
              significant improvements in the quality of our undergraduate instruction, the
              quality of student-faculty research in the department, and our reputation as a
              prominent educational leader.
