Abstract    :
              This project, the Thermal Fluids Laboratory, includes experimental equipment and
              instrumentation in support of courses in and of those comprising the basic
              principles of heat transfer and fluid dynamics. The instrumentation is typical
              of a modern R&D laboratory. The experiments are designed to enforce the
              fundamentals of thermal/fluid processes and to illustrate current industrial
              problems and approaches to their solution. The laboratory supports required
              courses in civil and mechanical engineering at the undergraduate level.  
              Additionally, the Thermal Fluids Laboratory is open to students for independent
              projects when not utilized for scheduled classes.    The Thermal Fluids
              Laboratory  encourages a solid background in the fundamentals of science and
              engineering while affording the students experiences in relevant and timely
              engineering applications of local and national industries and manufacturing
              firms.
