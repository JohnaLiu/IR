Abstract    :
              Molecular biology laboratory experiences adapted from those developed at the
              University of Arizona (The Biology Project:
              http://www.blc.arizona.edu/instructions.html) are being introduced into the
              community college environment.  Students are gaining hands-on experience with
              techniques presently used in biotechnology. Emphasis is on the role of
              molecular biology in the future of the human environment and medicine and the
              effect of biotechnology on the enrichment of agriculture. The laboratory
              experiments focus on DNA Restriction Analysis; Recombinant DNA Technology;
              Reverse Transcriptase; and Polymerase Chain Reaction and are being integrated
              into three courses: Environmental Science, College Biology I & 11, and
              Microbiology.  Laboratory investigations are being adapted to result in three
              significant outcomes: allow students a better understanding of abstract and
              esoteric concepts that previously have been confined to the lecture setting;
              increase enrollment and retention rates of science majors through hands-on
              experiences; and allow highly-qualified students to enroll for honors credit.  
               The impact of the laboratories on understanding and retention will be assessed
              and the information disseminated.
