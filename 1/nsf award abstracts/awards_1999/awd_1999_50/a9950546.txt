Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funds to facilitate implementation of exemplary neuroscience
              laboratory instructional sequences into the interdisciplinary neuroscience
              minor at a women's liberal arts college. The requested equipment will
              complement and expand the utility of recently acquired biological and
              biobehavioral instrumentation to support entirely new laboratory components in
              two core neuroscience courses, additional sequences of neuroscience laboratory
              exercises in three ancillary neuroscience courses, and diverse student research
              projects. The improved neuroscience minor will introduce students to the modem
              experimental techniques and methodologies of neuroscience and give them the
              practical laboratory experience and opportunities to prepare them for graduate
              work. This instrumentation proposal supports and integrates research-driven
              curricula in the psychology and biology departments and the model seminar-based
              and leamer-centered general education curriculum of Wesleyan College, which
              focuses on handson experiences and collaborative problem solving as practical
              and effective ways to learn.

To realize the goals of exposing students to
              modem neuroscience instruction, instruments, and methods, and of providing
              advanced students with equipment to support sophisticated directed and
              selfdesigned neuroscience research projects, we are seeking funds for three
              categories of instrumentation: electrophysiological equipment for studying
              cellular and systems neurophysiology, stereotaxic, stimulating, and
              biobehavioral monitoring equipment for studying the neuronal control of
              behavior, and models for clarifying neuroanatornical relationships. The
              infusion of this equipment into our curriculum will greatly expand the range of
              modem neuroscience techniques available to biology and psychology students,
              foster interdisciplinary thinking and integrative research projects, and
              provide students with an improved conceptual understanding of, and a wealth of
              practical experience with the methods of modem neuroscience.
