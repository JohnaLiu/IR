Abstract    :
              This project addresses the integration of mechatronics principles throughout the
              engineering curriculum at the University. This integration is achieved in the
              context of team oriented, project-based design activities. The project adapts
              the course content and laboratory experiences of successful domestic and
              foreign mechatronics curricula ( at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Rennsalaer
              Polytechnic Institute, Ohio State University and the University of Melbourne).
              Mechatronics principles and applications supported by this project are
              introduced in an integrated way in the existing Principles of Electrical
              Engineering course for non-EE majors and in a new Introduction to Engineering
              Design course for freshman engineering majors.  The pre-college component of
              the project introduces students to mechatronics through the adaptation of the
              "What's a Microcontroller?" curriculum by Parallax.  In addition to the mastery
              of the subject matter, the project stresses improving student competencies in
              communication skills, teamwork, and project management and promoting the
              motivation for lifelong learning among working professionals.
