Abstract    :
              This project focuses on development, evaluation, and national dissemination of
              instructional materials based on advances in undergraduate education and
              effective educational practices proven to enhance student learning. The three
              products of this project are "Next Generation Lesson Plans," a bank of related
              concept-based questions, and a national information clearinghouse for a basic
              engineering science course - statics. These products have potential to be
              useful to thousands of statics instructors in implementing next-generation
              strategies for enhancing and assessing student learning.

The Next Generation
              Lesson Plans specify expected student outcomes and include mini-lecture
              outlines, readiness (or reading) quizzes, cooperative learning activities, and
              classroom assessment techniques. A bank of conceptual questions for readiness
              quizzes, cooperative learning exercises, attention quizzes, and tests support
              the implementation of the Next-Generation Lesson Plans. Conceptual questions
              target  all six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. A National Statics Clearinghouse
              (NSC) containing information about, and links to, major publications,
              pedagogical advances, and course materials related to statics is under
              development. The NSC will provide "one-stop shopping" for instructors to find
              information and materials focused on the improvement in student learning in
              statics.
