Abstract    :
              Graphical user interfaces have become commonplace and are now much more easily
              built. Languages like Java are available to build user interfaces using the now
              familiar object oriented, event-driven programming model. Curricula for
              human-computer interface courses have been proposed by (Greenberg, 1996), NSF
              (Strong, 1994), ACM (Hewett, 1992), and Carnegie-Mellon University (Perlman,
              1989). This project adapts and implements these curricular recommendations into
              a practical undergraduate graphical user interface course targeted at schools
              with Carnegie classification of Master's and Baccalaureate.

The course is
              based on the curricula recommendations cited above.  Students in the course
              implement GUIs following the design principles derived from HCI research as
              well as the specific guidelines literature that is also available. Students
              build interface prototypes at various degrees of fidelity. Designing and
              executing usability studies with participants from the proposed user population
              are also part of the course.

An important aspect of the course is its
              interdisciplinary nature. Faculty from graphic design and technical writing are
              participants in the course. This aspect of the course is meant to show computer
              science students that expertise from other disciplines is necessary in the
              design of graphical user interfaces.

The materials from the course have
              potential to be widely disseminated. The long-term goal of this project is
              increasing the number of such courses taught at the target institutions by
              sharing course materials and experience in a variety of settings. The
              short-term goal is bringing this material to our students.
