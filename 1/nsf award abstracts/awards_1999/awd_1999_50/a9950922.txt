Abstract    :
              Students' understanding of current molecular and cellular concepts is being
              enhanced through adaptation of modern molecular/biochemistry techniques into
              their laboratories while simultaneously adapting and implementing an inquiry
              research based approach into the classes concerned.  The laboratories are
              designed to adapt a cooperative group approach to solving a long-term problem. 
              This is a coordinated approach to changing the curriculum.  Three courses, one
              introductory, two upper division are affected.  A basis for the adaptation can
              be found within the Bioquest home page (http://bioquest.org/note21.html and
              http://bioquest.org/peas.html)
