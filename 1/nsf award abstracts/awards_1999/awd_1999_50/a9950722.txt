Abstract    :
              Boston University in collaboration with the Education Development Center is
              developing materials for a course, Connected Algebra, to prepare mathematics
              teachers.  The materials will make connections to the mathematics taught at the
              middle and secondary school levels.  The course will contain detailed
              information about the ideas, including historical information and connections
              to school mathematics; mathematical investigations that facilitate
              understanding and application of the key ideas in mathematics and other content
              areas; and vignettes of lessons with middle and high school students dealing
              with the key ideas.  This "proof of concept" project will result in sample
              modules on which full development of the materials could be based.
