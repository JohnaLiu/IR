Abstract    :
              Project DAWN ("Developing Alabama's Workforce Now") is a  partnership among
              Gadsden State Community College, Central Alabama Community College, Alabama
              Southern Community College, and three manufacturing centers of the Alabama
              Technology Network.   The goal of Project Dawn is to produce a new associate of
              applied science curriculum in manufacturing technology, with the option of four
              specialties: (1) electronics; (2) industrial machine and tools; (3) textile and
              apparel; and (4) forestry, paper and chemical.   Gadsden state Community
              College is conducting a pilot program with the following components: (1)
              assessment of manufacturing technology needs within Gadsden and Alabama; (2)
              investigation and study of exemplary manufacturing technology programs,
              including on-site visits; (3) development of a model curriculum, in cooperation
              with local industries; and (4) evaluation and dissemination of the results. 
              This two-year pilot will produce four curriculum manuals, one for each of the
              optional specialties.
