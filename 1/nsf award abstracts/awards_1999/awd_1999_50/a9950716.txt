Abstract    :
              Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (AES) is an important laboratory tool in both
              analytical and physical chemistry. To provide undergraduates with experience
              with AES, the Department of Chemistry is introducing the use of an Inductively
              Coupled Plasma (ICP) instrument in experiments in three upper-level
              laboratories. Experiments from the research literature are being adapted so
              that undergraduate students are able to carry out investigations that use the
              ICP-AES to make critical determinations.  Students in Instrumental Analysis
              Laboratory are analyzing their own sweat for elemental content, and comparing
              the results for one of the elements, zinc, with the value obtained by flame
              Atomic Absorption. Physical chemistry students determine the temperature of the
              plasma from the relative intensities of the atomic emission lines and from the
              Saha equation for the intensities of lines from ions. The ICP-AES also is being
              used in the Biophysical Chemistry Laboratory as part of an experiment on the
              metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase. With addition of these experiments, all
              chemistry majors gain hands-on experience with ICP-AES at least once in their
              undergraduate years.
