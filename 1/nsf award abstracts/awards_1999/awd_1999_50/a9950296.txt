Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of a series of shared polymer laboratory
              experiments for an extended physical chemistry laboratory.  This extended lab
              entails the involvement of three colleges (Wofford College, Converse College,
              and the University of South Carolina at Spartansburg) working together to
              fashion a modern physical chemistry lab based upon shared experiments and
              student collaboration. The goal of this work is to introduce experiments in
              modern methods of polymer characterization to a currently operating extended
              physical chemistry laboratory.

This project adapts the gains from NSF
              supported projects on development and use of extended chemistry laboratories
              (NSF-DUE 9452453 and NSF-DUE 9751605) and the POLYED project (NSF-DUE 9254351).
               Experiments for polymer characterization involve the use of a differential
              scanning calorimeter and a gas pycnometer. Also included is a shared light
              scattering experiment. 

The characterization experiments have been designed
              with the advice of two industrial chemists.  These experiments focus on the
              contrast between the properties of small molecules and polymers, and on the way
              that processing a polymer in a commercial product affects its morphology and
              thus, its properties. 

Student collaboration is accomplished by electronic
              mail and by publishing results on the internet.  This mode of information
              sharing by students at different locations not only facilitates communication
              skills, but serves as a dissemination platform to other students, chemists, and
              scientists working on these materials.
