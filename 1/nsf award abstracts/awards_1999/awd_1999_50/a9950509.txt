Abstract    :
              Beginning Algebra and Statistics courses at Spartenburg Technical College are
              being transformed from lecture-based courses to project-based courses in which
              students learn content as they progress through a series of projects.   Goals
              include: (1) technology literate graduates; (2) graduates with better affective
              skills, including problem-solving and team-building skills; (3) graduates with
              a clear conception of mathematics as it relates to the real world; and (4) a
              model for mathematics education at the two-year college level. 

This project
              is adapting, extending, and implementing materials and practices developed by a
              number of projects including "Interactive Statistics" by Martha Aliaga and
              Brenda Gunderson; "Practical Statistics by Example Using Microsoft Excel" by
              Terry Sincich, David Levine,and David Stephen; "Data-Driven Statistics Courses
              in an Interactive Teaching Laboratory (DUE-9751571), Project Chance; and
              others.  The current project will also develop some new materials.
