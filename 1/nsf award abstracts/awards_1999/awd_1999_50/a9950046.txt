Abstract    :
              
This is a three-year project to prepare technical high school students for
              technical career opportunities through a 2+2+2 program. Focusing initially on
              the construction trades it will develop an integrated technical education
              model. The model included teacher preparation, faculty development, diversity,
              and the integration of technology into interdisciplinary curriculum modules.
              The project draws upon other NSF/ATE supported projects and NSF/Teacher
              Enhancement supported projects. The project also provides internships and other
              experiential learning opportunities.
