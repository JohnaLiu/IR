Abstract    :
              Instrumental analysis is infused into the undergraduate chemistry and
              environmental sciences curricula through the acquisition of a computerized
              scanning UV/Vis spectrophotometer and water purification system.  This
              instrumentation is used vigorously for the determination of water quality, pH,
              chemical functional group absorption, protein concentration, enzyme kinetics,
              multi component analysis of mixtures, RNA concentration, structural
              isomerization, and molecular transition.  Each experiment, adapted primarily
              from the Journal of Chemical Education and other respected sources to the
              appropriate complexity of each course, is designed to shift the emphasis from
              mere data collection to immediate analysis and interpretation of graphical
              results.  The UV/Vis spectrophotometer and water purification system are
              utilized in General Chemistry, Fundamentals of Chemistry, Biochemistry,
              Quantitative Analysis, Physical Chemistry, and Environmental Sciences. 
              Expected outcomes include the enhanced student involvement in the use of
              scientific instrumentation to collect experimental data, the introduction of
              spectrographic analysis of processes in real time and at the UV range,
              increased student ability to interpret data and trends from graphic analyses,
              and improved student understanding of fundamental chemistry concepts.
