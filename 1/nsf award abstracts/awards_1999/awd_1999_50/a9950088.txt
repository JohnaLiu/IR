Abstract    :
              

This project is developing, field-testing, and disseminating a multimedia
              simulation system via the Internet for training aviation maintenance
              technicians. It is enhancing the comprehension of the interdisciplinary nature
              of a career in aviation maintenance technology (AMT) by students, including
              women and minorities, reducing the training costs by maximizing the
              adaptiveness of the curriculum, and improving laboratory safety with minimized
              environmental hazards, via a coalition of a two-year college, a four-year
              university, a high school, professional associations, and the software and
              aviation maintenance industries. The project is (1) developing five simulation
              modules, each targeting a particular aspect of aviation maintenance technology
              in the two-year associate degree programs; (2) field-testing the AMT simulation
              system in two-year college aviation maintenance classes on its pedagogical
              effects and economy on an ongoing basis complemented with confirmative tests;
              (3) introducing the developed AMT simulation system and the technology of
              developing similar simulations to AMT faculties at two-year colleges via
              teacher workshops with participants recruited nationwide; and (4) disseminating
              the simulation system via both the Internet and CD-ROM to two-year college AMT
              faculty and high schools counselors throughout the
              nation.
