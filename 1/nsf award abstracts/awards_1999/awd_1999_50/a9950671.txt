Abstract    :
              The project is developing a Web-based introductory statistics course:
              VISUALIZING STATISTICS.  The course will be activity-centered; flexible and
              adaptable; real-world problem oriented; and rich in its use of the World Wide
              Web. VISUALIZING STATISTICS will comprise a set of complementary elements
              designed to facilitate the learning and teaching of statistics.  For students
              it will provide a full course, with individualized tutorials, tools for
              distance learning, and self assessment tests.  For instructors, it will provide
              an effective, modern teaching tool.  It will contain two complementary
              components: 1) modular units,covering a central statistical concept or method;
              and 2) case studies, structured to interact with the modular units.
