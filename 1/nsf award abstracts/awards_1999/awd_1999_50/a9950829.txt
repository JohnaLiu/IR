Abstract    :
              This EMD project creates a set of laboratory exercises based upon 20-30 computer
              science programs written in Java and accompanied by web-based tutorial material
              to enable students to work on large problems.  It addresses the need in
              computer science education to provide real-world experience and exposure to
              complexity for students by working with actual exemplary code in a set of large
              programs across a wide range of application areas.   These exercises are being
              developed and tested to provide students with the opportunity to read, explore,
              discuss, experiment with and design solutions to problems based upon existing
              large and robust programs.   In addition to the showcase projects, software
              tools and tutorials are being developed for students to use when working with
              the programs.

The evaluation plan includes a formative evaluation at
              Northeastern University, accompanied by testing at multiple sites with diverse
              student populations such as Pace University, Rochester Institute of Technology,
              and Norfolk State University in Virginia.    Faculty enhancement workshops are
              planned to be held at Northeastern University as well as at national and
              regional conferences.     A textbook, lab manual and an accompanying CD-ROM
              containing the programs and exercises are under development to provide national
              dissemination of the materials.   The PI's are developing a web-based newsgroup
              comprised of faculty using the materials.
