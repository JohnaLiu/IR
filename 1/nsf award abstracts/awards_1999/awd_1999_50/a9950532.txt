Abstract    :
              This project improves recruitment and retention of students in science and
              engineering. The objective is to develop an introductory hands-on course in the
              area of telecommunication electronics so that the students are exposed to the
              technology at an early stage.

Experiments of this laboratory are divided
              into two groups. The goal of its first section is to introduce the laboratory
              equipment through simple experiments. It includes the measurement of
              resistance, the color-coding, tolerances, and characteristics of the periodic
              signals. Students perform statistical analysis to analyze the data. Commercial
              software is introduced for this purpose. Thus, the students develop skills
              needed to perform experiments of the next set. The second set of experiments
              introduces fundamental concepts of radiation, frequency domain, time domain,
              modulation, demodulation, analog, and digital signals. Students use PSpice and
              HP Advanced Design System (ADS) to simulate their circuits and systems. The
              laboratory reports include an analysis of the results.
