Abstract    :
              With our departmental success in implementing experiments into our introductory
              physics labs that incorporate a "hands-on, minds-on" approach,  this project
              extends this approach into several upper division physics courses.  By adding
              experiments to illustrate the principles of the courses,  students examine
              experimental methods and techniques.   The experiments adapted and implemented
              into these courses are in the areas of high temperature superconductors, video
              capture and analysis, temperature distribution across a flat metal plate,
              simulations of charge and current distributions, particle behavior of light,
              the uncertainty principle, particle in a box, Fabry-Perot interferometer, and
              diffraction patterns from coherent sources. These experiments, adapted and
              implemented from the American Journal of Physics and from similar efforts in
              other physics departments,  are conducted outside of class as extended homework
              exercises.   Dissemination occurs through presentations at professional
              meetings and via our website.
