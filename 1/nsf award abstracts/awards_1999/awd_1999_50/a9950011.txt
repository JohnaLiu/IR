Abstract    :
              
Miami University Middletown and the Partnership for the Advancement of
              Chemical Technology (PACT) Consortium is conducting a three-year project
              entitled "Increasing the ImPACT," which builds upon and expands national
              efforts to proactively enhance and increase access to chemical technology
              education. Three categories of initiatives are being conducted in this project:
              

1) faculty enhancement -- 10 faculty/teacher development workshops
              servicing 200 educators are being offered; 

2) curricular materials
              development -- preparation of one monograph and a second one through the
              testing stage and one CD-ROM; 

3)  networking to increase the impact on
              chemical technology students -- collaborative projects including hosting PACT
              forums, developing and disseminating a career brochure on Chemical Technology:
              A Career of Choice, establishing and documenting models for a
              technicians-in-residence program, and developing a chemical technology student
              project award program.  

To accomplish these activities PACT is marshaling
              the combined talents, experience, and expertise of recognized leaders in
              chemical technology education, giants in the chemical industry, and the
              forerunners in the movement to improve advanced technology education from
              professional societies.
