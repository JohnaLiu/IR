Abstract    :
              The Configurable Laboratory Book for Delivering Laboratory Experiences at a
              Distance project supports laboratory experiences enhancing three undergraduate
              courses at Washington State University.  With four campuses, the Washington
              State University operates an interactive telecommunication system  that links
              all of the campuses. What the telecommunications system lacks is the capability
              of delivering laboratory experiences.  This alternative approach to providing
              laboratory experiences at a distance is modeled after the successful NSF funded
              on-line lab at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC).  The
              laboratory experiences  developed at UTC  support chemical engineering related
              systems.  This project adapts those experiences to ones that support
              manufacturing engineering control systems.     
The project also involves the
              development of World Wide Web based chapters on these laboratory experiences,
              enabling remote users to interface with actual hardware located in the
              laboratory.  These chapters are designed to be configured easily into
              customized laboratory books.   The project enables the delivery of laboratory
              experiences involving specialized instrumentation and equipment within the
              Washington State University System and beyond consistently and for the first
              time.
