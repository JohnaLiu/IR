Abstract    :
              This project adapts and implements a microcomputer based physics laboratory
              curricula developed by Thornton, Sokoloff and Laws.  The curricula, proven to
              assist students in understanding physics concepts,  enhances the physics
              laboratory at Shelton State Community College.  The advantage of MBL is to
              stimulate students into actively engaging in their physics education.  MBL
              promotes group learning by encouraging students to interact with each other
              while performing their laboratory projects.  Active participation by the
              students enhances the efficiency of their learning.   Microcomputer based
              laboratories are powerful learning tools enabling students to visualize the
              intricacies of physical phenomena.  This project impacts five physics courses: 
              calculus-based physics (two courses), non-calculus based physics (two courses)
              and physics for the non-science major (one course).
