Abstract    :
              Many students often have little or no confidence in mathematics and science and
              suffer from insufficient or inappropriate training.  Yet many colleges and
              universities do not offer a laboratory course in the natural sciences that is
              designed and taught specifically for non-science majors.  The Sunlight, Science
              and Understanding:  A Theme Based Interdisciplinary Course targets non-science
              majors, especially future teachers.  Adapted from the NSF supported Unity of
              Science Project at Mt. Holyoke College, this one semester course also
              incorporates selected features of similar courses at the University of South
              Florida, the University of Colorado, and St. Andrews Presbyterian College. 
              This laboratory course, built around the theme of sunlight, its sources, uses,
              scientific  and societal issues, stimulates active learning and is team taught
              by faculty from three science disciplines.  This unique course also satisfies
              the general education requirement of the University.
