Abstract    :
              
This is a three-year project to design and develop a Pre-Technology program 
              using an interdisciplinary approach; using real-life illustrations from
              industry and appropriate technology; forming learning communities that
              emphasize collaborative learning; assessing students' learning using work keys
              criteria; and recruiting underrepresented high school students into ATE
              programs. The project brings together Onondaga Community College, three area
              high schools, two additional New York community colleges, and local industries
              led by United Radio. The key component is a 1-semester integrated program. Its
              focus is a cluster of interdisciplinary, modular courses that include
              electronic skills, mathematical skills, composition skills and computing
              skills. Other components are Industry Internships, Teacher Training, and Career
              Awareness sessions. Internships will be the summer following completion of the
              program.
