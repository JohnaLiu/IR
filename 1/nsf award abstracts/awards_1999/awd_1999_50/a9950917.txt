Abstract    :
              The project is conducting a large-scale revision of the traditional sophomore
              level linear algebra course, emphasizing an object-oriented view of vectors and
              matrices.  The approach builds explicitly on the background of the students
              proceeding from concrete practical examples to the development of general
              concepts, principles, and theory.  The approach gives particular attention to
              the balance of theory, techniques and applications.  The course integrates
              computer laboratories to aid in visualization to allow students to work on real
              world problems and explore concepts.

A consortium of colleges and
              universities has been formed to assist in the design and evaluation of the
              materials.  The first half of the project will result in a supplement including
              labs and projects to be used with a traditional text.  This supplement will be
              the basis of a new textbook to be produced in the second half of the project.
