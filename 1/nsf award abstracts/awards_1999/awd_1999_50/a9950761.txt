Abstract    :
              The proposed project is aimed at enhancing senior college students'
              comprehension of endocrinology through student based research, problem solving
              and learning, and laboratory hands-on investigations. To achieve this, and to
              expand the students' research equipment pool, the following research equipment
              is being acquired: a set of mini-gel systems for electrophoresis and blotting
              techniques, and a microplate reader and ancillaries for precise hormonal
              measurement by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.  In the
              new approach, adapted from several projects previously funded by NSF and HHMI,
              students review literature, develop hypotheses, design and conduct experiments.
               By actually participating in scientific inquiry, students master the
              scientific method, gain enthusiasm and confidence in science, conduct high
              quality research and presentations. This approach to learning better prepares
              the students for various post-graduate pursuits and careers. The experience
              gained is being publicized through manuals, meetings, workshops, journal
              articles and via internet to schools and colleges around the country.
