Abstract    :
              This project presents an innovative, seamless approach to improving the teaching
              and learning of mathematics for elementary teachers. It aims to enhance the
              quality of elementary education mathematics by implementing materials that
              improve pre-service and developmental mathematics training in the content and
              reconceptualization of mathematics. A four-course sequence of developmental and
              mathematics education courses, taught by cross-institutional faculty teams from
              Eastern Michigan University, Henry Ford Community College, and Schoolcraft
              College, are implementing the Uri Treisman workshop model, through utilizing
              NSF K-12 materials--Investigations in Number, Data, and Space, Connected
              Mathematics Project and Core Plus Mathematics. A major theme uniting the
              curriculum is reconceptualization versus review and remediation addressing the
              needs of prospective elementary teachers who are underprepared in
              mathematics.

Changes in students' content knowledge, problem-solving
              ability, and attitudes toward mathematics are being measured by both formative
              and summative evaluations. Participating faculty are disseminating results to
              the mathematics education and developmental mathematics communities through
              articles and presentations; distributing project/ seminar materials for the
              courses; and exchanging ideas and data via a World Wide Web site linked through
              the University's home page and EMU's Web Caucus. EMU's national prominence in
              preparing educators gives the project's success extensive visibility and
              impact.
