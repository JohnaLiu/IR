Abstract    :
              Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy is one of the
              most important analytical tools in chemistry. This project involves the
              integration of  FT-NMR theory and laboratory experience into our chemistry
              curriculum via the conversion of a functional, but outdated, continuous-wave 60
              MHz permanent magnet system to a pulsed FT spectrometer using a commercially
              available package from Anasazi Instruments.  This upgrade enables our students
              to have hands-on experience with 13C, two-dimensional, or multinuclear FT-NMR
              techniques.

This approach adapts gains from the work Breton (NSF-DUE
              9750684) in the implementation of this conversion to a FT-NMR system.  Adapting
              this existing technology fulfills our curricular needs and is a practical and
              economical alternative to the purchase of an expensive superconducting NMR
              magnet.  The upgraded instrument allows our students to (1) learn how to
              operate a modern FT-NMR spectrometer in their sophomore year, (2) efficiently
              obtain and interpret 1H-, 13C- and 31P-NMR spectra of products they synthesize
              in the laboratory, (3) perform advanced NMR experiments such as relaxation
              measurements, kinetics monitoring, spectral editing (DEPT), and two-dimensional
              NMR (COSY, HETCOR), and (4) perform remote processing of NMR data.  Specific
              improvements in seven laboratory-based chemistry courses are ongoing, beginning
              with sophomore-level organic chemistry and continuing through senior-level
              advanced courses.  This project is significant in its positive impact on our
              chemistry curriculum and its aid in preparing our students for graduate school
              and future careers.
