Abstract    :
              To incorporate truly modem NMR techniques into the undergraduate curriculum, the
              chemistry department is implementing use of the Anasazi "EFT-60" Fourier
              Transform Package. This system allows for collection of proton, C- 13, and 2D
              spectra, thus allowing for the introduction of the methodology of structural
              elucidation into the laboratory and classroom experience at a fraction of the
              cost of super-conducting instruments. 

The instrument is being used widely
              by a variety of students all at different levels of chemical literacy.  In
              Organic and General Chemistry, the students obtain the proton and C- 13 spectra
              of synthetic products. Using this information in conjunction with FT-IR
              spectra, students have the necessary tools available to determine product
              structure, a task difficult without C- 13 data. In a non-traditional approach,
              the instrument is being integrated into the curriculum of non-science majors
              from a less rigorous standpoint.

The project also is having a regional
              impact on institutions devoted to secondary education. The college currently
              serves the needs of forty high school students annually through an outreach
              program, Exposing pre-college students to modern techniques and instrumentation
              is motivating students to solve a variety of challenging problems, and perhaps
              may interest them in the careers available to chemists.
