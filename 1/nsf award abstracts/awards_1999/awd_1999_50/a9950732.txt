Abstract    :
              This project creates a modern integrated laboratory-learning environment that
              allows students the opportunity to learn the theory and practice of wireless
              telecommunications and to investigate the effects of high frequency on
              electronic components, devices and systems. Adapting exemplary practices from
              other NSF projects with input from industry, and the development of laboratory
              experiences are to be done by an interdisciplinary science, mathematics, and
              engineering technology team. Specialized RF test and measurement equipment and
              simulation software will be used to facilitate these goals. The results of this
              CCLI-A&I project are to be disseminated to other interested two- and four-year
              technology programs as the model for laboratory instruction for the wireless
              telecommunications industry.
