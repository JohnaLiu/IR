Abstract    :
              This project is adopting the modular approach to teaching chemistry courses
              specifically to a non-Science, Math, Technology, and Engineering (non-SMET)
              audience. We are adapting three modules previously developed by ChemConnections
              (ModularChem Consortium and ChemLinks Coalition) for use in a new,
              environmental chemistry-based non-SMET chemistry course. Six new modules also
              are being developed, tested, and refined. Three of the new modules are for use
              in a course with a "Chemistry of Materials" theme, while the other three
              modules are being created for a course with a "Chemistry in Society" theme.
              Several new laboratory explorations are planned for use with the new modules.
              We are incorporating Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Differential
              Scanning Calorimetry into these explorations.

Dissemination of the results
              of this project is occurring through presentations at regional and national
              meetings. Additionally, we intend to publicize the availability of the new
              modules through ChemConnections and electronically disseminate them to anyone
              wishing to adapt them for use at their own institution.
