Abstract    :
              Tennessee Technological University (TTU) has developed and implemented a
              multimedia software package, entitled The Homework Laboratory, which is
              designed to increase student understanding and retention while saving the
              instructor time in terms of grading and coaching. The Homework Laboratory is a
              new approach to engineering education which: (1) randomizes the variables for a
              student's homework so that each problem is different for every student; (2)
              scores each homework problem; (3) coaches the student as necessary; and (4)
              averages the scores for the professor at the end of the semester. The software
              is also capable of scoring and assisting with unassigned textbook problems for
              practice or creating randomized and timed practice tests.

The Homework
              Laboratory is being used in engineering mechanics classes at TTU and appears to
              enhance student understanding and exam preparedness. TTU has formed a
              partnership with the University of Texas at Austin (UT) and Addison Wesley
              Longman Publishing, Inc. for: (1) implementing the software in 24 engineering
              mechanics classes at the University and UT via CD-ROM and campus network; (2)
              evaluating the effectiveness of the concept at improving student comprehension
              and retention;  (3) modifying The Homework Laboratory approach based on the
              evaluation findings; and (4) implementing the software over the internet.

In
              addition, The Homework Laboratory has potential for improving instruction in
              grades K-12.  It is being modified by a group of pre-service K-12 teachers who
              are students at TTU.  They are adapting it for use with a physical science
              textbook that  has been adopted in grades 8 and 9 in Tennessee.  The materials
              are being field tested by the TTU pre-service teachers, who are working towards
              licensure.
