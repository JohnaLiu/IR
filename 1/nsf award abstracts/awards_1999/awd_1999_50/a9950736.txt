Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop, test and evaluate a set of
              web-based modules to be used as the required reading for an interdisciplinary
              course, Introduction to Cognitive Science (PSYC/CSCI 3126). This set of modules
              are expected to have national impact.  The modules are to include textual
              material and interactive exercises designed to introduce upper division
              students to core topics in this discipline. A project team comprised of faculty
              from computer science, psychology, philosophy, and linguistics are leading the
              development and enhancement of the materials during the summer. In subsequent
              fall and spring semesters, the materials are to be tested and reviewed by
              faculty who teach a cognitive science course at other institutions. Final
              evaluation is to occur during the spring semester 2001 when the Web-based
              modules are to be required reading for students enrolled in Introduction to
              Cognitive Science. Upon completion of the project, the modules are to be freely
              available on the Internet and are to be maintained by course instructors.  It
              is anticipated that the maintenance effort can be funded through institution
              granting mechanisms.
