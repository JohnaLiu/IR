Abstract    :
              Computer graphics is a tool for the working scientists, mathematician, and
              engineer.  The value of computer graphics is expanding as the scientific
              culture embraces scientific visualization and as powerful computers become more
              commonly available.   The traditional computer science course in computer
              graphics has required a level of computer science sophistication that has made
              it inaccessible to other science and engineering students.  Now that new
              graphics tools are readily useable by students who have programming knowledge,
              but are not computer science majors, the introductory computer graphics can be
              revised to accommodate a broader range of students.  

This proof-of-concept
              project creates a set of materials to support a computer graphics course
              accessible to students with only the first year computer science programming
              courses.   Thus students from other science and technical fields will be able
              to take the course along with computer science students to learn how to use the
              new graphics tools now available.   These materials are being developed in
              collaboration with the San Diego Supercomputer Center and are being evaluated,
              tested, and disseminated in conjunction with the ACM SIGGRAPH Education
              Committee.
