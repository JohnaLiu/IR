Abstract    :
              This project is reforming and enhancing the learning of mathematics in line with
              educational research and current nationwide calls for changes in pedagogy in
              mathematics education. Technology is being utilized in mathematics courses to
              teach techniques such as collaborative learning, learning by discovery, and
              concept exploration. The project is adapting and implementing technology based
              on methods from NSF Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) projects
              at SUNY A&T Cobleskill in New York, Shoreline Community College in Washington,
              and Queensborough Community College in New York. The mathematics department is
              allocating one classroom for a mathematics laboratory to run software including
              Derive and Scientific Notebook with Maple. All calculus classes are meeting in
              this classroom along with a select subset of classes in Math for Elementary
              Teachers, Intermediate Algebra, and Precalculus.  On-line quizzes are being
              prepared. As a two-year college, students are being prepared for transfer to
              four-year colleges and universities as well as for life-long learning. The
              mathematics laboratory is fostering motivation, innovation, and learning.
