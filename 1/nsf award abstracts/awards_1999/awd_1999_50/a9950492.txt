Abstract    :
              Use of a high-field NMR instrument is giving our students access to current
              technology in NMR instrumentation and is better preparing students to be
              professional chemists because all of the courses involve projects that simulate
              industrial group work.  Standard NMR experiments used at other institutions as
              well as experiments drawn from the NMR research literature are being adapted to
              the group work setting.  Students are exposed to all aspects of NMR from an
              introduction to basic spectral use at the first-year level, routine instrument
              use at the Organic level (proton and carbon), quantitative calculations,
              2-dimensional NMR, and splitting patterns at the Instrumental/Physical level,
              and multinuclear NMR and unknown characterization with several analytical
              techniques at the Advanced Topics level.  Approximately 250 students per year
              majoring in chemistry, natural science, biology, medical technology,
              pre-professional programs, and secondary education-science emphasis are using
              the instrument. Two cross course projects using research-based NMR analysis
              involve 180 students directly each year.  In addition, the NMR is used in a
              range of undergraduate research projects.  Exposure of local high school
              teachers and students occurs through planned programs in the Chemical Educators
              Association and Chemathon. Other junior college and four-year college faculty
              receive exposure at the Small College Conference.
