Abstract    :
              The primary purpose of this project is to enhance the digital design experience
              of students throughout the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) curriculum
              at the Dearborn campus of the University of Michigan. In recent years, industry
              has adopted the use of digital design tools that can significantly shorten the
              time required to complete a design and bring a product to market. These
              software and hardware tools include hardware descriptive languages, such as HDL
              and VHDL, field programmable gate arrays, and digital simulation packages, such
              as PowerView.  The core of the proposed project is a series of laboratory
              experiments that are spread over a 3-course sequence in digital systems. The
              first set of experiments is adapted from exercises in standard digital logic
              textbooks using state-of-the-art technology. This is followed by experiments
              adapted from tutorial examples provided by PowerView. The advanced experiments
              are adapted from ideas presented at an RASSP workshop on VHDL and a workshop
              conducted by Verilog.
The goal of the project is to integrate current design
              tools in a consistent and pedagogically sound manner throughout the computer
              engineering curriculum.
