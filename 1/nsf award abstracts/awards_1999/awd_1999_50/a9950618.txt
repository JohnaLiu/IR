Abstract    :
              Building on new information about cognitive development in mathematical
              thinking, the mathematics department at Columbia College is developing a
              curriculum for developmental algebra, which incorporates handheld computer
              algebra systems (CAS). Careful attention is paid to building on students'
              intuitive understanding of mathematical principles; algebraic manipulative and
              writing are used to help students acquire an understanding of underlying
              concepts; symbolic algorithms are explored and practiced; and the handheld CAS
              is employed to facilitate the symbolic computations. The text has been tested
              extensively on the campus of Columbia College and is currently being tested at
              four other colleges in South Carolina. All indications are that the new
              approach is successful in significantly improving the student's attitudes
              toward mathematics, ability to succeed in courses beyond the developmental
              level and persistence in mathematics related study. This project has received
              the 1998 International Conference on Technology in Collegiate Mathematics Award
              for innovation and excellence in using technology to enhance the teaching and
              learning of mathematics.

It is anticipated that this project will result in
              a commercial product and national classroom testing of this new approach.
