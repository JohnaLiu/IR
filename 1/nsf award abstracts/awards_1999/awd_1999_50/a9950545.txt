Abstract    :
              Service-Learning Practices have been widely adapted in other disciplines in
              higher education, but very few in geology.  We have adapted Service-Learning
              Practices in upper-division undergraduate Earth Science courses from the model
              set forth by Mogk and King (J. of Geological Education, 1995) who used this
              approach in their lower-division geology classes.   We have upgraded our
              existing geophysical equipment enabling the curriculum in a number of
              upper-division undergraduate courses to be modified for adapting
              student-centered learning by studying community-based problems.  The upgrades
              include a DC resistivity meter, a  12-channel seismometer to 48 channels, and
              the real-time kinematics (RTK) function to 2 Trimble 4000 SSI GPS receivers. 
              The improvement of lab equipment  impacts 120 undergraduates and the research
              of faculty and graduate students.  This equipment is used in at least eight
              upper-division undergraduate courses offered by the Department of Geology and
              Geophysics, two by the Department of Geography, and two hydrogeology courses
              taught at the Environmental Earth Science Department, Eastern Connecticut State
              University.   The RTK GPS receivers  are used in developing new mapping
              techniques and in increasing the University's ability to provide outreach
              service to the surrounding communities.  Some of our service-learning projects
              at the local community scale include 1) geological and environmental feature
              mapping; 2) groundwater and soil investigation associated with environmental
              protection; and 3) geotechnical investigation associated with construction and
              development. The proposed adaptations have stimulated multi-lateral
              interactions among undergraduates, and between undergraduates and graduates,
              students and faculty, students and engineering professionals, as well the
              educational institution and the local community.
