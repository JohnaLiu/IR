Abstract    :
              Bismarck State College (BSC), a community college in Bismarck, North Dakota and
              the EPRI Similator and Training Center, based out of Kansas City, Missouri, are
              joining resources and expertise to provide a quality comprehensive curriculum
              that will meet national needs for the education of power plant operators. This
              will be a significant improvement over current practice.  Two specific goals of
              the project are: 1) strengthen science, math and technical curriculum and
              instructional materials which support energy technology education; and 2)
              increase the number of students, especially women in non-traditional fields,
              Native Americans and other minorities within the region, who are technically
              prepared for employment in the energy industry; in order to meet the increasing
              need for well-educated technicians and engineers who can perform in a variety
              of capacities in the energy industry.
