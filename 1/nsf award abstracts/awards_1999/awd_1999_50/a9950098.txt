Abstract    :
              
The North West Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET) at Bellevue Community
              College (BCC), the applicant organization, and the Institute of Electrical and
              Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE) propose to collaborate on the development of
              a video on Information Technology (IT) careers provisionally entitled Cyber
              Careers for the Net-Generation. This video will have a target audience of
              middle and high school students and non-IT major college students. Cyber
              Careers will include a special focus on women and minorities, who have been
              traditionally underrepresented in the IT field. The main purpose of the
              NWCET/IEEE collaborative video is to inform students about IT careers and to
              attract them to the IT profession. The video will also focus on two goals: 1)
              emphasizing the appeal of the profession in the view of younger students and 2)
              projecting a positive image of the IT
              worker.
