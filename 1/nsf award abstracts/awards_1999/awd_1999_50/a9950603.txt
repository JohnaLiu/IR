Abstract    :
              The study of neurons and other electrically active cells is one of the most
              important areas in biology, and almost all universities offer neurobiology
              courses to their undergraduates. Educators in many areas of biology are
              realizing the value of software that simulates biological experiments towards
              teaching students both concepts and how to think like scientists. Currently
              there is no comprehensive, general-purpose simulation program designed
              specifically for teaching neurobiology. This project is developing teaching
              software that can simulate a wide range of experiments. It is designed to be
              useful for beginning undergraduate students up through graduate students.  A
              set of laboratories is being written to go along with this software that
              teaches neurobiology concepts in an open-ended, exploratory way. The software
              also allows instructors to design their own laboratories or to modify our labs
              to suit their classes.
