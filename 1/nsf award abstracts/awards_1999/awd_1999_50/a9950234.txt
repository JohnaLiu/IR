Abstract    :
              Many American manufacturing organizations are adopting "agile" product
              development practices in an effort to retain their predominant position in
              today's fast changing global environment.   The growing product complexity and
              resultant diverse skill requirements underscore the need for organizations to
              work together as a "Virtual Enterprise".  A Virtual Enterprise (VE) is a
              temporary consortium of companies formed quickly to explore fast-changing
              opportunities.

In this context,  there is a need for graduating engineering
              students that are proficient in the methods, concepts, and software used in the
              VE subject areas.  This project is developing a Virtual Enterprise Engineering
              (VEE) laboratory to facilitate the learning process for students.  This
              development adapts and merges the related laboratory experiences at Texas A&M,
              the University of Houston, and the University of Illinois at Chicago and
              supports on-going curriculum development at Utah State University.
