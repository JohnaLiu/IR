Abstract    :
              This project details the development of a new course in quantitative analysis
              that is designed to capture the imagination and interest of chemistry majors
              and of larger numbers of students of environmental and biological sciences. The
              revised course will improve students' preparation for independent research
              opportunities with faculty mentors. 

The project is to implement work from
              "The Chemistry of Water" (NSF DUE 9156123). The primary object is to enable
              students to:  1) receive training in analytical chemistry that is current,
              level-appropriate, and of the highest quality; 2) see how their own laboratory
              results relate to an ongoing scientific investigation and thus how scientific
              knowledge advances through collation of independent data sources; 3) gain
              mastery over the internet's power to facilitate the sharing of data; and 4)
              work on assignments that take account of their varied learning styles. 
              Successful innovations and modifications will be shared with the larger
              community of chemical and environmental educators. 

A working group of
              faculty members from the Departments of Chemistry, Marine and Coastal Sciences,
              Environmental Sciences, and Biochemistry has devised means to obtain for
              students a set of oceanographic samples with research significance.  Students
              will analyze these samples in many different ways and compare their results
              with those obtained by active research scientists.  New experiments will be
              designed by project investigators knowledgeable in instrumental chemical
              oceanography (NSF BES 9402540); trace element analyses (NSF OCE 9601668; NSF
              EAR 9316242); and analytical techniques related to phytoplankton pigmentation
              (NSF OCE 9402540). The organization of the group laboratory activities will be
              based partly on the ideas of P.M. Treichel and colleagues (NSF DUE 9450615) and
              will also be influenced by experience gained in connection with a course on the
              Greenhouse Effect (NSF DUE 9354742), and a program recently begun at Rutgers
              for Institution-Wide Reform of Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering,
              and Technology (NSF DUE 9850071).  

The proposed innovations will affect a
              diverse group of undergraduates. Current enrollment demographics indicate that
              an appropriate audience is being and will be reached. (e.g., Fall 1998: 50%
              male, 50% female; 10-15% latino; 5-10% African-American). The revised course
              will rely on the use of the web for distribution of course materials and for
              transfer of data among students and from the web site for Rutgers' Long-term
              Ecosystem Observatory.
