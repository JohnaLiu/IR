Abstract    :
              Bergen Community College and Passaic County Community College are collaborating
              with four-year colleges and industry representatives on the Interdisciplinary
              Science Technology (IST) project. This project is designed to meet needs
              identified by industry employers, including a growing demand for
              interdisciplinary science technologists who can use a variety of analytical
              instruments and deal with the new employment realities of rapidly changing
              assignments, variable functions, and multicultural teams.  Community college
              faculty and expert advisors from four-year colleges and from high technology
              industry employers in the region will develop, implement, and evaluate a
              broad-based Interdisciplinary A.A. S. curriculum to:  
1.	Prepare students to
              effectively use a variety of modern laboratory equipment and analytical methods
              required by business and industry employers.
2.	Help students gain interactive
              classroom based experiential learning about work.
3.	Create interactive
              interdisciplinary learning modules that simulate workplace problems,
              activities, and assignments.
4.	Integrate laboratory internships, work based
              learning experiences, and mentor relationships.
5.	Arrange peer support groups
              and an array of academic supportive services that will ensure student
              retention, completion, and employment or further education, especially among
              under-represented populations.
