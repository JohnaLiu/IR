Abstract    :
              Undergraduate students, especially those planning majors in non-science
              disciplines, frequently do not see mathematics as relevant to their education.
              They often find it difficult to comprehend the relevance of mathematical
              concepts in their chosen majors and the usefulness of mathematics for their
              educational development. 

The main goal of this project is to improve the
              mathematics literacy of students majoring in the social sciences, behavioral
              sciences, and humanities by means of Web-based interdisciplinary and
              interactive lessons.  The project team also believes that the interactive
              lessons will enable the students to develop their critical thinking and
              quantitative skills, and to become better citizens. The Web-based (on-line)
              lessons are being developed by faculty educators in Mathematics, Business &
              Economics, Music, and Philosophy working together. 

The project effort is a
              tri-institutional collaboration among Washington State University, the
              University of Idaho, and North Idaho College, a two-year institution.  The
              project is increasing the integration of technology in education and supporting
              faculty development.
