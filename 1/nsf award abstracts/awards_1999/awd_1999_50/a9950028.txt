Abstract    :
              Sinclair Community addresses the shortage of information technology (IT)
              technicians by working with local industry to develop curricula that educate
              students for rapidly changing competencies needed by the workplace.  IT
              curricula are integrated from high school through the associates degree with
              emphasis on using the IT skill standards and implementing instructional
              materials developed elsewhere.  The project builds on a fundamental IT skills
              and employability skills to provide specialties in networking and
              telecommunications, web technologies, and programming and analysis.  A
              "Fast-Track" intensive certificate program provides students with work
              experience and an advanced skill set in programming and analysis.  Professional
              development for faculty includes industrial experience and short courses in
              pedagogy and content both for full-time and part-time faculty.  Working with a
              local institution employable IT skills are provided to the visually impaired. 
              Evaluation is done in conjunction with other projects.  Dissemination is done
              by links to three other community college systems.
