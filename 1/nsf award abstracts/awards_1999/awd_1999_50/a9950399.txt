Abstract    :
              Three introductory chemistry laboratories are being equipped with workstations
              containing Ocean Optics CCD spectrometers, servers, and networking hardware.
              The spectrometers, in conjunction with capabilities for data collection and
              manipulation of data, are being employed in a series of new fully
              network-integrated inquiry laboratories through which students are determining
              and experiencing 1) the nature of interactions between matter and light, 2) the
              relationship between concentration and absorbance, 3) the concept of
              equilibrium and speculation, and 4) the nature of reaction rate and its
              relationship to reactant concentration.  The project is adapting cooperative
              learning and an inquiry-based approach into these laboratories, and is adapting
              standard experiments to make use of the new equipment and pedagogical
              approaches.
