Abstract    :
              This project, structured upon the educational model presented by Wikle and
              Lambert (1996) for integrating GPS into college curricula, integrates the use
              of statistical and spatial analytical techniques.   Adapting Global Positioning
              System (GPS) technology within the Geography and Environmental Studies Programs
              provides students with a variety of interdisciplinary skills that have aided
              them in:  1) constructing research hypotheses,  2) developing research
              methodologies, 3) collecting data, 4) analyzing, and 5) preparing
              presentations. This project recognizes that most environmental data are spatial
              in nature and require an understanding of location and use GPS technology to
              provide an effective technique for determining location and a method of
              recording the spatial characteristics of the environment. Students are exposed
              to GPS theory and application in forums ranging from introductory lectures and
              labs to more sophisticated GPS applications in junior- and senior-level
              classes. At the introductory level, this approach introduces a wide,
              interdisciplinary audience to GPS technology, its scientific foundations, and
              its growing importance in society. At the advanced level, this initiative
              exposes geography and environmental studies students to advanced mapping
              techniques using GPS and the integration of these data within GIS.
