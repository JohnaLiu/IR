Abstract    :
              In order to help undergraduate students grasp the basic concepts underlying the
              role and function of proteins in living systems we take the students on a
              journey, from gene through mRNA to functional protein - showing them a "day in
              the life of a protein." The vehicle for this journey is the visually appealing
              Green-Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Discovered in bioluminescent jellyfish and sea
              pansies in the 1960s and characterized in the 1970s, GFP has recently become
              one of the most exciting and useful molecules in the field of biotechnology.
              When expressed in either eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells and illuminated by UV
              light, GFP emits an eerie green glow. This light fascinates students, allowing
              them to see where the protein is located, and by the intensity of the glow, how
              much protein is present, giving the students a very direct interaction with the
              protein. Using both wild-type GFP and a blue colored variant as tools the
              students explore the concepts behind gene transfer, gene expression and
              regulation, as well as the relationship between protein structure and function.
              Because the students use GFP throughout all their explorations in the
              laboratory course, they experience a continuity of purpose seldom achieved in
              the biochemistry teaching laboratory. During this journey the students obtain
              direct hands-on-experience in the basic techniques used in modem
              biotechnological research. This experience helps prepare the students to enter
              a society in which issues involving genetic and protein engineering are
              becoming ever more common.

The implemention of these changes to the
              Biochemistry laboratory course is based on information in the literature from
              both basic and applied research on GFP. Adapted NSF funded research information
              comes GFP work in basic biophysical properties (9632342), bioimaging (9816947 &
              9513065), ecophysiology (9604528), cell physiology (9604342 & 9603730),
              genetics (9505535 & 9874491) and environmental research (9701018). Other
              adapted material from NSF funded education work is from cellular physiology
              (9875939) and glycopeptide biochemistry (9874744). Furthermore, gains from a
              NSF-ATE work in biotechnology are adapted (9602356).
