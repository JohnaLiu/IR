Abstract    :
              This project implements a model laboratory for use by computer science students
              in a distributed systems course and a computer networks course.  It adapts and
              updates pedagogical strategies from similar projects around the country, basing
              the lab upon the latest distributed networking technology now available.  A
              collection of innovative laboratory modules are being developed to provide
              students with practical experience to complement the theoretical material
              covered in the course.  

ALAMODE consists of 21 PC's, a fileserver, and a
              100 MB network switch specifically designed to simulate a real wide-area
              network.  One of the 21 PC's is being used to simulate a faulty wide area
              network to provide fault tolerant aspects to projects.  The use of a real
              network switch provides students access to cutting edge network technology.  
              The D'Agents mobile agent system is being adapted for the simulated wide-area
              network,   

An evaluation is being directed by an assessment committee
              examining student learning at several stages during the courses as well as an
              exit survey of student attitudes.  The laboratory modules with explanatory
              notes are being made available to other computer science departments interested
              in developing similar courses.
