Abstract    :
              This project is enhancing the quality of undergraduate instruction by using a
              fluorescence spectrophotometer to carry out steady state and time resolved
              fluorescence measurements in several upper level undergraduate laboratories. 
              Students have hands-on exposure to fundamental concepts which they often have
              difficulty grasping. Particularly, concepts involving quantum mechanical theory
              related to electronic properties of molecules and the interaction of light with
              molecules are being brought to life in the undergraduate curriculum. The
              courses affected are Instrumental Analysis, Physical Chemistry, Inorganic
              Chemistry and Independent Study and Research. A carefully chosen set of
              experiments from the research literature and from the Journal of Chemical
              Education is being adapted into the courses.  Students gain a more detailed
              understanding of spectroscopy, kinetics, quantum mechanics and
              structural/optical properties of molecules and materials through laboratory
              applications of steady state and time resolved emission techniques.
