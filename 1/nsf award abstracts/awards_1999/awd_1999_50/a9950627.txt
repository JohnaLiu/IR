Abstract    :
              The Chautauqua Program provides faculty an annual series of workshops in which
              research and teaching scholars at the frontiers of a number of science
              disciplines, mathematics, and engineering work intensively for several days
              with undergraduate faculty to bring them up to date with the state of the art. 
              The workshops provide opportunities for participating scholar instructors to
              communicate new knowledge, concepts, and techniques directly to college
              teachers in ways which are immediately beneficial to their teaching.   

The
              overall objective of this program is to enable undergraduate faculty in the
              sciences, mathematics, and engineering to maintain their undergraduate
              instruction at the highest levels of effectiveness.  To achieve this goal year
              after year, the Chautauqua Program actively seeks to refresh to the pool of
              workshops with new education experiences reflecting the progress in improving
              undergraduate education.  

The Chautauqua Program is national in scope.  It
              is anticipated that throughout the USA these workshops will provide 15,000
              faculty with enrichment experiences who will (collectively) impact 2,625,000
              undergraduate students per year after year 5.  It is also anticipated that
              about 5,000 of these faculty participants will be drawn from two-year colleges.
