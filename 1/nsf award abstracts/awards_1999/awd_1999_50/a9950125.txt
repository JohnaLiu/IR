Abstract    :
              Creating values and knowledge for the future (Dewey, et al, 1995) requires
              quantification of landscape flows and processes (Diaz, 1996) which in turn
              require students trained on current equipment (Congalton and Green, 1992).  In
              meeting the needs of today's students,  we have adapted GIS/GPS into our six
              forest technology courses: 1) Forestry Software Applications 2) Forest
              Surveying, 3) Advanced Forest Measurements, 4) Forest Management, 5)
              Silviculture, and 6) Forest Measurements and Surveying Field Practices.  
The
              adaptation of GIS/GPS into the entire forest technology curriculum has provided
              a tool for students to manage natural resources in a responsible
              manner.
Learner-based instruction is the focus on each course with extensive
              field experiences where students integrate their knowledge implementing the use
              of  technology.   All new curriculum and course materials are distributed
              conventionally and are available on the web.
