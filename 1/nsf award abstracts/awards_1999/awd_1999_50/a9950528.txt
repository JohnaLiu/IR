Abstract    :
              Many elementary and secondary school teachers teach as they have been taught. 
              In may cases, this results in following a given textbook slavishly.  Research
              on learning documents improved retention of course material by students
              actively involved in the learning process.  This project focuses on the
              development of new curricula in mathematics and science for teacher preparation
              programs which promotes active student involvement in learning.  Integrating
              the content of mathematics and science, the new curricula teaches pre-service
              teachers  the use and benefits of proven techniques of inquiry-based
              instruction as an integral part of their teacher education program by example. 
              The project builds on the successful physics and mathematical initiatives
              nationally and statewide, respectively.  The curricula are designed using the
              results of the pretests to determine prevalent preconceptions and to define
              topics for inclusion.  Course materials are pilot tested in teacher education
              programs on two campuses of The Ohio State University.
