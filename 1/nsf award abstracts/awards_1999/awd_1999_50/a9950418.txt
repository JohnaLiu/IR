Abstract    :
              Use of a gas chromatograph is allowing for substantial modification of a
              high-enrollment course in physical science for students pursuing certification
              in elementary education. The course assumes an environmental focus, utilizing
              the chromatograph to develop a water quality testing ability. The testing
              laboratory provides a service to the local agricultural community and a
              hands-on environmental experimentation for teacher-education students and other
              students in the fields of chemistry and biology. The water quality testing for
              which the gas chromatograph is used involves the participation of biology
              students, chemistry students, and other students taking chemistry courses and
              the College's work program.  Trained students manage the water-quality testing
              program.  The gas chromatograph also is used for collaborative independent
              research involving the chemistry and biology faculty and undergraduate
              students.
