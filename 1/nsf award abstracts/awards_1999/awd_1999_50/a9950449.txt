Abstract    :
              This proof-of-concept project supports the development and implementation of a
              new course in scientific programming based entirely on software freely
              available over the Internet.  The traditional computer-programming course for
              science majors is based primarily on a compiled programming language (Fortran
              or C) rather than on a user-friendly interactive and graphical interpreted
              environment.  This leads to significant barriers to the integration of
              computing into the subsequent  science course work.  The new scientific
              programming course utilizes the compiled programming language in the context of
              the freeware SCILAB, a computational environment similar to MATLAB that easily
              interfaces with Fortran or C subprograms.  The course focuses on science majors
              early in the academic career learning  to solve an array of computational and
              graphical problems representative of those encountered in undergraduate and
              graduate courses. A website designed to assist undergraduates in creating
              individualized suites of computational and graphical tools, based on the
              scientific programming course, for personal computer use is under
              development.
