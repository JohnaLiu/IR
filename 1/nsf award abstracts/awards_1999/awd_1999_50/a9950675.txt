Abstract    :
              The Department of Biological Sciences at Eastern Illinois University
              offers
undergraduate majors courses in Animal Physiology and Comparative
              Vertebrate Physiology and non-majors a course in Human Physiology (General
              Education course). For teachers obtaining the Masters Degree in Natural
              Sciences program, a summer course in Animal Physiology is also offered. The new
              PowerLab-based Physiology Laboratory provides a unique physiology teaching
              center shared by students in all physiology courses. The
PowerLab is a
              powerful and affordable system designed for both classroom teaching and
              advanced research projects. It is an adequate tool to introduce to students
              principles, applications and instrumentation in modern, experimental
              physiology. The main goals of this laboratory are:

1) involving students in
              interactive and investigative projects to develop critical thinking skills of
              making predictions and solving problems;

2) teaching students modern
              physiology techniques and methods that will be used in their future workplace
              or graduate school;

3 )evaluating, through experimental results, theories
              and facts taught in the
lecture;

4) providing resource for secondary school
              science teachers in the area.
        
The Physiology Laboratory is also a
              valuable resource for Honors students completing Honors thesis in Biology, and
              undergraduate students pursuing independent research projects.
