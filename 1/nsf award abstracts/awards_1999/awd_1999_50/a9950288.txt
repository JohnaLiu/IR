Abstract    :
              In response to national trends and local needs, the Department of Biology &
              Physics and the Department of Chemistry have introduced a cross-departmental
              Biochemistry Option upon conversion from quarters to semesters (Fall, 1998).
              Our goal is to best prepare students at our all-commuter campus for a variety
              of biochemistry-related careers. While planning the option, we identified a
              main concern: students lack adequate laboratory exposure in three key areas
              (proteins, enzymes and nucleic acids) and three general areas (purification,
              spectroscopy, computer technology). Thus, our objective is to integrate current
              technology in these areas across the curriculum adapting the models at Ventura
              College (NSF award DUE 9750770) and Michigan Technological University (NSF
              award DUE 9152722). The project affects six courses spanning from the
              introductory to the senior level. To facilitate this step, we are introducing
              equipment for electrophoresis/analysis of proteins and nucleic acids, a
              microtitre plate reader, a refrigerated table-top centrifuge, and personal
              computers (for lab use).  The project impacts Biochemistry Option students,
              chemistry and biology students and undergraduate research students supervised
              by three faculty. In support of this project, we: 1) establish an advisory
              board for ongoing input from industry, graduate schools and professional
              schools and 2) centrally locate biochemistry equipment within the College of
              Science and Mathematics for accessibility. The outcomes are laboratory
              experiences which facilitate student learning of current technology and related
              literature reports, readily accessible biochemistry laboratory equipment, and a
              program with a mechanism for continued response to the changing needs of our
              area.
