Abstract    :
              The upper-level chemistry courses are being modified by introducing thematic
              experiments focussing on problems of environmental interest.  The improvements
              are coming with the augmentation of available instrumentation to allow for the
              most common methods of environmental analysis. The specific objective of these
              improvements is not to teach environmental chemistry, as such, but rather to
              develop student understanding of the capabilities of the instruments or
              environmentally important chemical processes, and to assure an intellectual
              exchange across a set of experiments. To achieve the change, the curricula in
              the instrumental methods course and physical chemistry laboratories are being
              modified by adapting relevant experiments from the Journal of Chemical
              Education, the research literature, laboratory manuals in instrumental and
              analytical areas, and from standard EPA methods.  All of the activities
              employed to achieve the desired result are hands-on, student-centered, and have
              significant student reporting components.
