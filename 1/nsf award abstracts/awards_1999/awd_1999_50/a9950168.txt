Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the development of the foundation for a coherent
              curriculum in the area of Information Science and Engineering (ISE).  The
              objectives of the project are: the formal definition of the overall ISE
              framework and its curriculum, design of at least one ISE core course and its
              offering at Arizona State and at two test sites (Univ. of Nebraska and Wright
              State Univ.), and training and assistance for others teaching the ISE course. 
              The main deliverable is a manuscript to support the core ISE course.  This
              manuscript is being developed for publication.  A detailed evaluation and
              refinement of course and curriculum along with web-site creation and
              maintenance is also being carried out.

The project team is developing a
              non-quantitative framework for ISE which is analogous to Shannon's quantitative
              theory.  Conservative logic is the approach chosen, which ties in with the
              conservative theories which are the basis for many of the engineering
              disciplines.  It is timely to study the foundations of information engineering
              starting with the idea of "conservation of information" based on conservative
              logic or a similar suitable logical framework.  An interdisciplinary team
              including practicing engineers from IT industry will participate in the design,
              launching, and evaluation of ISE curriculum development, specifically the core
              ISE course.
