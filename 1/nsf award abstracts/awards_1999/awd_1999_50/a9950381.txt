Abstract    :
              This proof-of-concept project is developing and evaluating two modules from a
              projected suite of seven mathematics modules based on using current, meaningful
              industry-based problems or case studies.  The seven modules are intended for
              use individually or as a complete college-level mathematics course,
              "Industry-Based College Mathematics," covering most of College Algebra and
              developing an effective set of problem-solving heuristics. 

The project
              includes testing and evaluation of the modules in use at Linn State Technical
              College, one or two members of the Missouri Mathematical Association of Two
              Year Colleges, Southeast Missouri State University, and Oklahoma State
              University at Okmulgee.

If evaluation confirms the expected value of this
              approach this project is expected to be the basis for full development of the
              complete suite of seven modules.
