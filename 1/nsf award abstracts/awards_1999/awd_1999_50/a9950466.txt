Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to improve course content and student learning in
              physics classes. Implementation will allow completion of an upgrade to
              laboratory and lecture demonstration equipment for use in all introductory
              physics and physical science classes, for both science majors and general
              education classes.

The equipment requested is computer based which will
              allow implementation of the most current data collection and analysis
              techniques. The new laboratory equipment will provide quick, graphical, real
              time feedback that makes possible study of a wider variety of experiences than
              were previously possible, while at the same time enhancing quantitative
              capabilities. This equipment is also necessary to allow community college
              students to start learning to use equipment and techniques which have become
              standard in universities and industry.

This project will encourage students
              to continue their study of science by providing the tools to master what many
              often find difficult concepts in science. It will help prepare both the
              science/engineering major and the non-science majors to increase their
              scientific literacy and to be better prepared for critical science related
              decisions in their future professional or personal lives, as science and
              technology affect more areas of daily living.
