Abstract    :
              A central facility is being established to: 1) help faculty in diverse
              disciplines introduce molecular biology techniques into undergraduate student
              laboratories; 2) establish an infrastructure that makes use of the facilities
              easy for other faculty and enables the department to track and schedule
              facility use; and 3) train undergraduate students in the techniques and
              pedagogies involved and then use them to help faculty develop and implement the
              new modules for the various laboratories depending on this equipment.
