Abstract    :
              This project is developing a suite of web-based multimedia courseware to
              simulate soil laboratory tests in geotechnical engineering. The benefits of
              this courseware include enhancing learning, retention and transfer of learning,
              improving the connection between theory, experiments and applications, making
              laboratory exercises possible at remote locations, and use of effective
              pedagogical strategies.

Interactions are coded in the courseware to recall
              prior knowledge, to stimulate learning and to test learning outcomes. The
              courseware simulates all the procedures that a student will normally perform in
              a laboratory class. Each student has his or her own virtual apparatus to
              conduct not only the standard test but also a variety of tests that existing
              equipment cannot accommodate. The consolidation, triaxial, direct shear and
              simple shear tests would be simulated. These tests are normally required as
              part of the curriculum for undergraduate civil engineering students. The
              courseware is being tested at the University of Illinois, Louisiana State
              University, Northeastern University, Syracuse University, Texas A & M
              University and at this University. Evaluation and assessment would be conducted
              with the help of the Instructional Assessment and Evaluations Services. John
              Wiley and Sons has agreed to distribute the courseware as a CD-ROM worldwide.
              The courseware is also on the web.
