Abstract    :
              The Southwest Missouri State University (SMSU) Department of Chemistry is
              committed to providing our graduates with a sound background in fundamental
              areas of chemistry coupled with an understanding of and exposure to modern
              instrumentation.  Our current project concerns the upgrading of a 200 MHz NMR
              spectrometer, which was purchased in 1987 with funds from a NSF-ILI grant and
              matching funds from SMSU.  Through this upgrade, our students have greater data
              acquisition capabilities and faster data processing.  The system is integrated
              into the campus network, thereby allowing rapid data transfer to PCs in the
              computer lab as well as to students in the classrooms.  

The use of NMR data
              transfer and storage methods is adapted from projects published in J. Chem. Ed.
              that have received prior NSF support (NSF-CHE 8620242 and NSF-BIR 9414026).  In
              addition, this upgrade allows for greater implementation of laboratory
              experiences for all chemistry majors including the following published projects
              in J. Chem. Ed. that have been developed through NSF support (NSF-USE 9151729
              and NSF-DUE 9152468).  Over 2000 chemistry students have used the NMR
              spectrometer in chemistry courses and research over the past ten years.  The
              transfer of technology from the instrument to another site (computer lab,
              classroom, or office) is an essential tool for increased usage by faculty and
              students.
