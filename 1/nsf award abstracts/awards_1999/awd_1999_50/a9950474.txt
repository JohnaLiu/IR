Abstract    :
              A recent NSF-sponsored workshop regarding Curricular Developments in the
              Analytical Sciences (DUE-9615091) recognized a need to implement experiments
              which prepare students for independent problem-solving in a laboratory setting.
               Such experiments provide students with opportunities  to solve problems
              through the cognitive skills of critical thinking and the use of modern
              laboratory techniques.  The effort at Kutztown University to implement these
              types of experiments involves the use of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
              (GC/MS) and the appropriate accessories.  The GC/MS is used in five laboratory
              courses (Organic Chemistry I and II, Environmental Analysis, Instrumental
              Analysis, and Biochemistry) for a total of eleven experiments.  Of these
              experiments, four are from the chemical education literature, of which two were
              developed with NSF support (Bishop: CHE-8952157, Rubinson:  DUE-9352407).  In
              one of the other experiments, a technique used extensively in commercial
              environmental analysis (purge and trap sample concentration) is adapted to the
              undergraduate laboratory curriculum.  Each experiment is problem driven in that
              its explicit purpose is to answer a question or explore an idea.  Students
              learn how to address chemical questions via laboratory methods by a graduated
              curriculum which requires from the student increasing amounts of experimental
              design.  In upper level courses experiments follow a problem-based learning
              model in which a group of students are given a problem and required to research
              the problem, develop a procedure, carry out the experiment, and analyze the
              results.  This training better prepares students to take an active role in
              experimental design in their occupation or further education.
