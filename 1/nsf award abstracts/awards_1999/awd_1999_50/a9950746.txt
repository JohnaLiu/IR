Abstract    :
              The project objective is to design and evaluate seven instructional modules
              (average speed, task completion, mixtures, distance-rate-time, biological
              dynamics, physical dynamics, review) to improve students' estimation,
              reasoning, and problem-solving skills in an intermediate algebra course. The
              modules provide an animation of the situation (filling a tank, completing a
              round trip) to provide visual feedback regarding the accuracy of students'
              estimates and calculations. Each module begins with estimation experiences
              which sharpen estimation skills and provide motivation for learning analytic
              techniques for calculating the answers.  Plot estimates and correct answers are
              provided so students can attempt to infer what kind of functional relations
              link the variables. Algebraic techniques are introduced for solving the
              problems, and the students are encouraged to apply these techniques to solve
              more challenging problems and to reason conceptually (such as explaining why a
              function approaches an asymptote).

The curriculum would be evaluated as part
              of the Minority Science Improvement Program at Southwestern Community College
              in Chula Vista, California. The student population is composed of 78% ethnic
              minorities including 52% Hispanic, 14% Filipino, 6% African American, 4%
              Pacific Islander, and 1 % Native American. The program is designed to improve
              the transfer rates of minority students who have an interest in mathematics,
              science, or engineering.
