Abstract    :
              The project objective is the construction of  an interdisciplinary undergraduate
              intelligent control laboratory.  The laboratory is based on the adaptation  of 
              recent advances in soft computing design techniques such as Neural Networks
              (NN), Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Neurofuzzy algorithms.  The laboratory design
              emphasizes creating experiments that are based on industrial applications.
              Industrial  design ideas, concepts and  innovative techniques that have already
              been utilized and demonstrated in a fully automated electronic assembly factory
              are to be incorporated into the laboratory design.  

The project includes
              learning experiences in several different processes, represented by stations in
              the laboratory, including DC Servo Systems, Heat Trainers, Inverted Pendulums,
              X-Y Tables and Visual Component Inspection Stations. Each station contains a
              microcomputer with  A/D, D/A , Frame Grabber interfaces  and six experimental
              setups. The effect of design performance, robustness,  cycle time and other
              design parameters are to be investigated by the undergraduate  students.

The
              use of  a digital computer with soft computing capability in a real-time
              control loop reflects the rapidly increasing use of these techniques for
              industrial applications.
