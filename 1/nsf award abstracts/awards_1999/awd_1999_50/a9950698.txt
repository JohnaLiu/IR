Abstract    :
              A collaboration among the Department of Biology and the Center of Excellence in
              Math and Science Education (COE) at Black Hills State College and a nearby
              tribal college, Oglala Lakota College (OLC), adapts and implements within
              molecular biology an approach, first developed in geology, to implement
              research based courses exploring the local environment (DUE 9551226). The past
              approach used Global Positioning Systems to provide data on the local
              environment. In the current project, faculty, pre-service and in-service
              teachers participate in workshops in molecular biology both to upgrade their
              skills and knowledge and to help implement courses adapting molecular
              approaches to the study of rare and sensitive local species. Two of the revised
              courses (Genetics and Conservation Genetics and Bio-diversity) are shared
              between the University and OLC.  The University delivers the lecture portions
              of the courses to OLC by distance education. The accompanying laboratories are
              taught by OLC faculty who have participated in the workshops.  In addition,
              undergraduate students at both institutions are offered research opportunities
              within these redesigned curricula and will be part of the workshops offered.
              The research opportunities available for preservice students and others and the
              courses themselves focus on conservation genetics of rare or sensitive native
              species in the region. Preservice students are an important component of the
              student population involved.  Inservice teachers involved act as mentors for
              the preservice students.
