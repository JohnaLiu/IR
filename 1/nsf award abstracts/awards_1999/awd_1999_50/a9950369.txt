Abstract    :
              This project will develop a set of web-based tools that students and others will
              use to examine and understand the dramatic demographic changes that have
              occurred in New York City from the turn of the century to the present.
              Exploratory visual and map enabled software tools will use a unique set of
              materials drawn from data and maps based upon the U.S. and New York State
              Censuses going back to 1905, which are being computerized as part of a long
              term project for the New York Times.

The tools will allow students to
              compare and contrast change in specific areas of New York City and among
              specific groups over a long time period, particularly in the areas of race,
              ethnic ancestry, family status, housing and income. Exercises that complement
              these tools will make it possible for students to study their own or another
              neighborhood in New York City and compare its characteristics with the city as
              a whole. They will be able to compare the fate of various race, ethnic and
              other groups over time. The tools will be visually oriented, and students will
              produce maps and charts that illustrate topics of interest interactively using
              a web browser. These materials will be pilot tested in a set of courses that
              focus upon urban, race and ethnic topics. They will then be offered generally
              "on the Web."

Queens College and its sociology department is one of the
              premier producers of primary and secondary school teachers, as well as students
              who go on to get a Ph.D. in sociology. The department itself has about 900
              majors. Its students, who are about 70 percent female, are drawn from the
              diverse mix of race and ethnic groups who inhabit New York City. Through
              partnerships with secondary institutions, the tools and exercises will also be
              developed for use by secondary school students.
