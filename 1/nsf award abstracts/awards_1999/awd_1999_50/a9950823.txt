Abstract    :
              In response to current thinking on undergraduate science education, this project
              involves a revision of the chemistry laboratory curriculum in an effort to give
              students more direct experience with the methods and process of scientific
              inquiry.  Traditional, "cookbook" laboratories often do not engage students in
              what chemists really do.  By introducing multi-week, project-based labs into
              the chemistry curriculum, students experience the discovery process and improve
              their problem solving and critical thinking skills.  In addition, as high field
              FT-NMR is integrated into all of the project-based labs, it becomes an
              essential tool for students to solve chemical problems.  

In our work,
              project-based/NMR labs adapted from the Journal of Chemical Education are
              introduced into the organic and inorganic chemistry courses.  In the sophomore
              organic laboratories the "guided inquiry" technique published by Spencer et al.
              (J. Chem. Ed., 1998) and the NSF-sponsored project of Olmstead (No.
              USE-9250902) is adapted and implemented in order to introduce students to 1H
              NMR.  In that same course, 13C NMR and DEPT and COSY techniques are introduced
              by the adaptation and implementation of the NSF sponsored work of Reeves and
              Chaney (J. Chem. Ed., 1998) as well as that of Branz et al. (No. USE-9151729). 
              In the inorganic laboratory course multi-nuclear NMR techniques are introduced
              by adapting the work of Schreiner et al. (No. DUE-9452264) and that of Richmond
              et al. (J. Chem. Ed., 1991).  A new, advanced NMR methods course is
              incorporated into the curriculum and includes experiments similar to those of
              Mills (J. Chem. Ed., 1996), which involve advanced techniques like NOE and
              HETCORR, coupled with molecular modeling.  Subsequently, project-based/NMR labs
              are also adapted and implemented into the physical chemistry and biochemistry
              courses.
