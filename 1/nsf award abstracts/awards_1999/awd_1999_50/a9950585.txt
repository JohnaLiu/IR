Abstract    :
              The chemistry faculty at St. Louis Community College at Meramec is integrating
              computers into all aspects of the first two years of the college curriculum. 
              To accomplish this goal, fifteen modern PCs have been added to the program. 
              Furthermore, this addition is occurring with corresponding adaptation of the
              methods described in "Computer Interfacing in the Chemistry Laboratory, by King
              Weyh, and Pavia.  One of the general chemistry laboratories is networked with
              12 PCs, one PC for the instructor, and one printer.  Two computers are
              networked into the organic chemistry laboratory.  Software is used to operate
              the existing departmental spectrometers, pH meters, and digital thermometers.
              Additionally, the PCs are used for the purposes of molecular modeling.

The
              integration of computers takes place across the chemical curriculum for the
              introductory chemistry course, Fundamentals of Chemistry, through the
              two-semester General Chemistry sequence and into Organic Chemistry.  Students
              use the PCs to increase computer literacy, to acquire data in the laboratory,
              to analyze data, and to visualize and explore the chemical world.
