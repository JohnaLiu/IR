Abstract    :
              This project addesses the problem of incorporating technology into science
              education without asking students to master complex programs and without
              requiring authors of instructional material to master Java programming.

The
              objective of the project is designing and implementing a collection of
              mathematically oriented Java "Beans" (software components) that can be used as
              interactive illustrations on Web pages. We call these components Math Beans.  A
              Math Bean should be limited in scope, and easy enough for students to use so
              that it requires almost no instructional overhead. Furthermore, it should be
              easy for authors of Web pages to use.  The configurability of Java Beans means
              that properly designed beans can be adapted, without programming, to a range of
              specific applications.  In this proof of-concept project, the objective is to
              produce several dozen Math Beans covering a range of applications and to
              provide a basis for further development.  

The material we develop will be
              published on the Web.  A workshop will be held in Summer 2000 for faculty who
              are interested in using Math Beans and the Web in their courses.
