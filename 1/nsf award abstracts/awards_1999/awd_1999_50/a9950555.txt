Abstract    :
              While nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is widely used in chemical research for
              purposes ranging from structural determination to measurements of dynamic
              processes, student access to such instruments at the undergraduate level is
              often limited due to high initial costs and ongoing expenses for cryogen and
              maintenance. In this project, the NMR is being used throughout the chemistry
              curriculum beginning in the first semester of general chemistry with simple
              measurements and progressing to more sophisticated experiments in the Advanced
              Chemistry Laboratory course, in undergraduate research, and in collaborations
              with local industry. Furthermore, faculty and students in organic chemistry
              classes at Kirkwood Community College and Mt. Mercy College, two nearby
              institutions that do not have NMRs, also are using the instrument. Students in
              an Advanced Placement (AP) Chemistry class from a local high school are gaining
              hands-on experience with the instrument as part of a unit on modern methods of
              structural determination which are being developed in collaboration with the AP
              Chemistry teacher. If successful, this collaboration will be expanded to AP
              Chemistry classes at other local high schools. Acquisition of this instrument
              is enhancing teaching and research, providing additional teaching resources to
              other local colleges, and providing opportunities for enhanced interaction
              between faculty at local colleges and secondary science educators.
