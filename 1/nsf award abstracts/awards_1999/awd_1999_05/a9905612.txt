Abstract    :
              The ESH project will study the changes in denitrification of the Arabian Sea
              over the last glacial cycle at a resolution of a few hundred years.  Both
              regional productivity and hydrographic conditions contribute to the suboxic
              intermediate waters necessary for denitrification.  The project will study a
              set of cores from the Oman margin transecting the modern range of suboxic
              waters, concentrating on times of rapid global climate change.  Variables to be
              analyzed include 15 N/14 N of sediment organic matter, carbon and oxygen
              isotopes of foraminiera, abundance of planktic foraminifera indicative of
              upwelling and of oxidation state of the intermediate waters, and Ba flux as a
              second measure of production.
