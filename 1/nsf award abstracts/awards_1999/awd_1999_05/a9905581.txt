An
              argon-ion-pumped ring-dye laser system is acquired and is used to obtain in
              situ quantitative gas-phase species concentration, temperature, particle
              diameter, number density, and volume fraction measurements in particle
              formation and growth studies.  Two diagnostic approaches are used: in one, the
              narrow line, tunable emission features of the ring-dye laser are used to obtain
              species profiles in particle-growth studies under controlled experimental
              conditions; in the other, the argon-ion laser is used as a high-power,
              monochromatic emission source for particle scattering studies.
