Abstract    :
              The PI will develop a physical-thermal-fluid model of the seismogenic zone that
              not only includes constraints from seismology but also from fluid flow that can
              modify both the stress and thermal state. He will explore a spectrum of models
              for fluid expulsion from the subducted crusts and its effect on the temperature
              regime. The objectives of the work are in accord with the overall scientific
              objectives of the Seismogenic Zone (SEIZE) initiative of the MARGINS Program
              that seeks to understand the temperature structure and the flow regimes in the
              seismogenic zones.
