DLI International: Online Music - Recognition and
              Searching

This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award. 
              This project, entitled The Online Music Recognition And Searching (OMRAS) is a
              partnership of the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval at the
              University of Massachusetts, and King's College London.  OMRAS aims to be an
              intuitive and efficient system for content-based searching and retrieval of
              musical information from online databases.  The information may be stored in a
              variety of formats ranging from encoded score files to digital audio.  The
              overall goal of this cross-disciplinary research is to fill a serious gap in
              existing online facilities for musical collections: the inability to search the
              content for music itself.
