Abstract    :
              The proposed research will address the speed and magnitude of the abrupt
              temperature changes that are now recognized to have occurred during the
              Holocene and the preceding glacial period, using sub annual measurements of
              nitrogen and argon isotopes in ice cores. Previous work has shown that nitrogen
              and argon isotopes record a signal of rapid temperature change due to isotope
              fractionation by thermal diffusion in air in the porous snow overlying the
              polar ice sheets. This work will increase the sample resolution by two orders
              of magnitude, to monthly sampling, to address the question of exactly how fast
              were the abrupt changes in climate. This approach is proposed based on the
              recent recognition that gas ratios in ice cores are annually-layered much like
              the better-known annual layers in the ice matrix. Because of the details of the
              air enclosure process, summer layers should contain air that is much less
              affected by smoothing than the seasonally-averaged bulk measurements made to
              date on ice cores. Thus very high-frequency information (order of 1-3 years) on
              climate change is present in the gases, if sampled at sufficient resolution..
              The results will constrain hypothesized mechanisms for the abrupt changes
              involving the atmospheric circulation and ocean reorganization.
