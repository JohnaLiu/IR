Abstract    :
              The US-Japan Cooperative Earthquake Research on Composite and Hybrid Structures
              NSF 94-154 is currently in its final states.  The research program was aimed at
              obtaining much needed basic information to understand the behavior and to
              develop practical design recommendations and procedures for composite and
              hybrid structures.  Therefore, which was constrated so far on component and
              subassemblage studies.  The research program has produced a wealth of useful
              engineering information.  However, testing work on full structural systems,
              which is critical for completing the joint research initiative has not been
              undertaken.  

This project follows the recommendation of the last annual
              meeting (October 1998) of the Joint Technical Coordination Committee, which
              strongly urged a careful planning effort for the full-scale testing.

The
              purpose of this project is to carry out the planning work on the US side (in
              parallel with similar work on the Japanese side) for the US-Japan cooperative
              research program on full structural system testing and related studies.  The
              planning effort will span over a period of 12 months, covering (1) holding two
              meeting of the US planning group and (2) holding a joint US-Japan Planning
              workshop in order to finalize detailed recommendations and plans for the
              program.
