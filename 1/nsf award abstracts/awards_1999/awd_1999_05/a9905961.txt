This award supports a planning visit to Rennes, France for
              preliminary research and proposal development.  Daniel Kilper of the University
              of North Carolina at Charlotte proposes to develop a collaborative research
              project with G. Michel Stephan of the Optics Division of the Ecole Nationale
              Superieure de Sciences Appliquees et de Technologie.  They will conduct
              preliminary studies of doped-glass microdisk and microring resonators, which
              are optical devices that may have potential for communication and optical
              sensing applications.  The studies will form the basis of a proposal to the
              cooperative science and engineering program of the National Science Foundation
              and French National Center for Scientific Research.
