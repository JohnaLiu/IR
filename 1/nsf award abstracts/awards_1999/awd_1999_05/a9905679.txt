Abstract    :
              We propose to investigate the environmenmtal control of breeding in populations
              of "crowned sparrows" of the genus Zonotrichia.  We have identified key
              populations in Artic, mid-latitudes and equatorial regions that express the
              full spectrum of extreme inflexibility of timing (Artic) to almost complete
              flexibility and asynchrony (equatorial regions).  Intermediate degrees of
              flexibility are found at mid-latitudes.  We also have a large corpus of data
              from a population of Melospiza melodia in western Washington State that
              expresses a similar cline of reproductive flexibility showing most plasticity
              in mild, coastal habitats and least flexibility in high altitude habitats in
              the Cascade mountains.  Field experiments will determine how flexible breeding
              seasons are within each habitat.  Parallel laboratory experiments will explore
              further how environmental signals such as change in day length, temperature,
              food and water interact with social cues to regulate neuroendocrine and
              endocrine secretions that orchestrate reproductive development.  The results
              will have practical application on how vertebrates may respond t global change
              in the near future.
