This award, jointly funded by the Americas Program and the
              Division of Biological Infrastructure, will help to leverage contributions from
              the Department of Agriculture and the Fondo Regional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria
              (FONTAGRO) of the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB), to support Discovery
              Dialogue Workshops aimed at identifying coincident agricultural research needs
              and interests among US and Latin American/Caribbean scientists and promote
              regional collaboration. 

The initial workshop, to be held in April 7-9, 1999
              at Texas A&M in College Station, Texas, will bring researchers from Latin
              America and the Caribbean to identify potential areas for collaboration.  An
              expected outcome of these Discovery Workshops will be the identification and
              detailing of specific research projects for submission to the IDB's FONTAGRO
              competition in 1999 and subsequent years, and a data base of research
              personnel, institutions, and projects that will stimulate cooperation between
              U.S. and Latin American/ Caribbean researchers.
