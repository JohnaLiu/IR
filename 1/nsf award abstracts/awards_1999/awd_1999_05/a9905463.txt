Abstract    :
              This project is a 3-year study of very recent (last 100 yrs or so) eruption
              chronology and lava geochemistry at mid-ocean ridges to better understand
              volcanic, hydrologic and biological processes at some of the world's
              most-active submarine volcanoes. The temporal variability of processes
              occurring at the mid-ocean ridge system is a key component for understanding
              the dynamics of these globally important volcanic structures and how they
              affect terrestrial environments. Eruption chronology will be determined from
              analyses of naturally-occurring radioactive elements in the lavas and by
              applying actinide-series disequilibrium techniques. Part of this work will use
              established techniques but part of the project involves development of new rock
              dating tools to further our reach back in time. The work plan is composed of
              three aspects to be conducted semi-concurrently:
[1] be "RREADI" to date very
              young (0 to 1.5 yrs since eruption) rocks for eruption verification in our
              existing facility using the 210Po-210Pb technique.
[2] investigate 210Pb-
              226Ra for use as a chronometer over the 1-100 yr time scale and apply it to
              lavas from areas of recent mid-ocean ridge eruptions.
[3] investigate
              variability in magmagenetic conditions in the sub-ridge mantle associated with
              the most-recent mid-ocean ridge eruptions by measurements and data modeling of
              longer-lived actinide series isotopes.
