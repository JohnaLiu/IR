Abstract    :
              This ESH project will analyze benthic foraminiferal carbon isotopic composition
              in a suite of surface sediment samples from the eastern equatorial Atlantic. 
              The samples are chosen to cover a range of calcite saturation states and
              organic carbon rain rates.  The relationships between foraminiferal 13 C values
              and these environmental parameters will be used to distinguish the effects of
              carbonate dissolution from those of organic carbon flux in affecting
              foraminiferal shell chemistry.
