Abstract    :
              This ESH project will use ocean and atmospheric models to reconstruct conditions
              at the last glacial maximum and to calculate the response of the climate to
              meltwater pulses during deglaciation.  The models will include oxygen isotope
              tracers in seawater and in atmospheric water vapour and these will be used, in
              conjunction with ecologic models, to estimate carbonate oxygen isotopes values
              in planktonic foraminifera and coral.  The calculated glacial-age deep sea
              sediment and coral.  Results from this project will test the ability of models
              to simulate different climates and help quantify climate changes over the last
              20,000 years.
