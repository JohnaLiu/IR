Abstract    :
              This collaborative proposal seeks support for a study to examine the timing of
              ice-margin retreat from the last glacial maximum positions of multiple lobes at
              three carefully selected sites in southern South America.  Date from the three
              widely spaced, well mapped moraine sequences from outlet lobes of the Tierra
              del Fuego ice cap will help evaluate the synchroneity of outlet lobe responses
              to climatic changes.  A combination of cosmogenic 3He, 10Be, and 26 A1 methods
              will be used to date glacial retreat from each of the moraine sequences.
