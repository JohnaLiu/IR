Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to investigate the metabolic engineering of
              solventogenic Clostridia using modern molecular biology and genetic techniques.
               The primary goal of this interdisciplinary proposal is to genetically alter
              the metabolism of Clostridium acetobutylicum.  The proposal describes four
              areas 
of activity; (1) a detailed examination of the regulation of the sol
              locus genes through a putative repressor, SolR; (2) a molecular analysis of the
              function of sporOA and of ORF (orfY) gene products, both of which are likely to
              be important in the expression of the sol locus genes; (3) an analysis of
              patterns of gene expression using cDNA arrays; and (4) the further development
              of antisense RNA as a metabolic engineering tool.
