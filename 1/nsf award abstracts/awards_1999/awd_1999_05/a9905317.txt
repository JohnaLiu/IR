Abstract    :
              	How can the electorate reach a reasonable decision in elections, when voters,
              individually, appear so uninformed and uninterested?  Existing micro-level
              theories of candidate evaluations and campaigns cannot account for aggregate
              learning and election results.  I propose a model of candidate evaluation that
              incorporates a social-psychological understanding of attitude strength that
              demonstrates how voters learn and use information about candidates.  It begins
              with the premise that voters separate their views of candidates into an
              evaluation of the candidate's policy positions and character traits, and the
              policy dimension is causally prior to the personal.  This relationship,
              however, is mediated by how certain voters are about the policy positions of
              the candidates.  Specifically, the policy positions of the candidate exert a
              greater influence over the perceptions of candidate character for those who are
              more certain.  As a voter learns more, as the policy attitude becomes stronger,
              its influence over both the personality dimension and the overall evaluation
              grows.  This thesis is tested in two ways.  First, I use three types of
              National Election Studies - standard cross sections (1980 through 1996), the
              1980 Major Panel Study, and the 1984 Continuous Monitoring Survey.  Finally,
              the underlying mechanism is isolated using an original experiment.
