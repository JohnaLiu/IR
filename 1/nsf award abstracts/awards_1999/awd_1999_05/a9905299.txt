Abstract    :
              This research award  seeks to obtain comprehensive information on the
              accumulation history of the GISP2 ice core, using a nuclear method based on
              in-situ 14C produced by cosmic rays in the firn "oxygen" during accumulation.
              This method was developed in a study of the well-documented Holocene of the
              GISP2 core, whose chronology and accumulation rates are fairly well
              constrained. This method allows characterization of ice accumulation rates in
              situations where reliable flow models cannot be constructed. The proponents
              seek to complete 14C analyses of several deep ice samples of ages 16-39 ky BP
              in hand, and also of ice samples which accumulated during special solar
              activity epochs. The first set of data would yield information on accumulation
              rates during the glacial period, while the second would shed light on the
              effects of changes in climate and cosmic ray fluxes during different solar
              activity levels.
