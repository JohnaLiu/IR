Abstract    :
              This award will provide  support to help junior U.S. scientists to attend the
              Tenth International Conference on Arabidopsis Research to be held in Melbourne,
              Australia, July 4-8, 1999.  The aim is to provide an opportunity for these
              young researchers to exchange ideas with colleagues from around the world on
              all aspects of research concerning the model plant Arabidopsis.  The conference
              will include sessions on environmental perception and abiotic stress,
              epigenetics and gene expression, structural and functional genomics, metabolism
              and trafficking, signal transduction, plant pathogen interactions, vegetative
              and reproductive development and differentiation, and fertilization and
              embryogenesis.

Arabidopsis is an excellent model for crop plant development
              and physiology, and many of the findings made in Arabidopsis are readily
              applicable to crop plants.
