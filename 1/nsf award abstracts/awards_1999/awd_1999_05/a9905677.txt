This project's aims are to elucidate enzymological and
              related
aspects of a recently recognized type of bacterial
              metabolism--the
biodegradation of organosulfur compounds known as sulfonic
              acids--that
occurs in anoxic habitats.  Such habitats are widespread on the
              planet.
Sulfonic acids are not only biosynthetic products of a variety of
              animals,
plants and microbes, but are products of chemical commerce (for
              example,
household and industrial detergents, dyes, and soaps).  These
              compounds
thus enter into both the carbon and sulfur biogeochemical cycles
on
              the planet.


It has recently been recognized that household and industrial
              detergents
known as sulfonic acids can be degraded, or cycled, by bacteria
              that
thrive in habitats in which molecular oxygen is in limited supply. 
              This
metabolism of sulfonic acids results in release of sulfide, a
              chemical
that has the smell of "rotten-egg" and is, in addition, corrosive to
              metal
pipes, for example.  How these particular bacteria bring about
              this
biodegradation is the focus of this research project.  The results of
              the
study may be of value in furthering our understanding of metal
              deterioration
and how to minimize it, as well as to deepen our understanding
              of
sulfonic acids' roles in contributing to the crucial cycling of carbon
and
              sulfur compounds on the planet.
