Title: Role of
              Arctic in Extreme Cold Outbreaks Affecting the United States

The planned
              research is aimed at understanding extreme wintertime cold outbreaks in the
              United States. The relative importance of physical processes in the Arctic and
              hemispheric-scale dynamics in the scenarios that lead to extreme cold outbreaks
              will be determined. Several tasks will be undertaken: (i) evaluation of
              trajectories of coldest airmasses in order to determine where, within the
              Arctic, cold airmasses originate; (ii) for three subregions of the US, the
              robustness of conclusions about recent decade-to-century scale variations in
              the frequency and intensity of extreme cold outbreaks; (iii) evaluation of
              global climate model simulations of cold Arctic outbreaks; (iv) assessment of
              impacts (economic, agricultural, social, human) of this manifestation of
              Arctic-midlatitude interaction; and (v) preparation of a web-based educational
              module on cold wave.
