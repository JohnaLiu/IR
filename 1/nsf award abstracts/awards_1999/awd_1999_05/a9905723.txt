Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

The investigators will perform an exosystem-scale study of
              nitrogen-driven eutrophication in the Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina, in
              which linkages between externally-supplied ("new") nitrogen loading and its
              role in phytoplankton blooms, associated carbon flux and the resulting sediment
              oxygen demand (SOD) will be investigated.  Specific aspects of the work will
              includ investigation of selective responses of bloom-forming phytoplankton
              groups to specifc forms of nitrogen from anthropogenic sources, the effect of
              these groups on SOD, and the impact of bloom mediated SOD on sediment-water
              column carbon and nitrogen fluxes.  Additionally, the effects of bottom-water
              oxygen levels on sedimentary nitrogen cycling will be studied.

The proposal
              was submitted in reponse to the Envirnmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry
              solicitation NSF- 99-9, and is being funded jointly by the Divisions of Ocean
              Science, Earth Sciences, and Chemical and Transport systems.
