Abstract    :
              This project is entitled CMNet (Chinese Memory Net): U.S.-Sino Collaborative
              Research Toward a Global Digital Library in Chinese.  It proposals to bring
              together select academic research and education partners in the United States,
              Taiwan and China to develop a sustainable digital library focusing on Chinese
              Studies.  The objectives are to build the necessary multi-national
              collaborations and resources communities by bringing together existing efforts
              in these countries and to establish new processes and coordinated activities. 
              By doing so the investigators seek to elucidate and prevent duplication of
              effort and emergence of fragmented, non-interoperable digital libraries
              resources in the area of Chinese Studies.  Instead the goal is to define
              characteristics of interoperable systems in this area, to find potential
              solutions for multilingual language processing, and to develop commonly
              accepted standards of methods, protocols, tools and technologies within the
              evolving high bandwidth international networked environment.
