Abstract

     The long-range goal of the present project is
              to integrate two important approaches to the study of semantics: the
              model-theoretic formal semantics tradition with ties to logic and
philosophy
              of language and an emphasis on a compositional syntax-semantics interface,
              and
lexical semantics with its roots in lexically and cognitively based work
              on semantics and semantic categorization.  This project also aims to link
              Russian and American traditions by building on the Moscow school of lexical
              semantics.
     In the study of how lexicon and grammar interact in semantic
              interpretation, the static view of compositionality as the simple putting
              together of given lexical meanings into larger wholes has been giving way to a
              dynamic view in which compositionality is seen in the context of the
              meaning-shifting potential of the parts that are being combined.  Essential
              issues for the present project include understanding the nature and roles of
              fine-grained type structure and sort structure of lexical meanings and their
              effects, in interaction with contextual information, on meaning shifts and
              coercions.
     The project's substantive focus is on controversial problems
              concerning the principles of
interpretation of genitives and related
              constructions with relational and non-relational nouns
(John's brother, John's
              team). These constructions have sparked debates concerning the division of
              labor and interactions among compositional semantics, lexical semantics, and
              context.
