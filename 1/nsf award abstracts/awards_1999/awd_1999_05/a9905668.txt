Abstract    :
              9905668

Models of the relationship between plant structural characteristics
              and climate need to be thoroughly tested to determine their validity and
              precision. The proposed work entails the collection of leaves and associated
              wood from native angiosperms in forested areas whose climate parameters are
              known.  The physiognomy of the leaves and wood will be used, in conjunction
              with existing climate models, to estimate temperature; these estimates will be
              compared with actual site temperature to determine the accuracy of the models
              and to refine their precision.
