Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with studying nucleation phenomena in crystallation
              processes.  The PI's have developed a new conceptual approach (Embryos
              Coagulation Secondary Nucleation) for understanding nucleation in these systems
              and have identified a very important problem to work on, involving chiral
              separations.  The objective is to develop the basic knowledge required for
              developing processes that enable the crystallation of pure enantiomers from
              mixed chiral solutions.  This would be a significant process advance with many
              potential applications in the pharameceutical industry.
