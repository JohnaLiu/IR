              Abstract

The primary objective of this research is to develop a continuous
              tree-ring chronology spanning the past 2000-years from living and subfossil
              wood around Prince William Sound, southern Alaska. This chronology will provide
              an annually resolved record of North Pacific climate for the past
              two-millennia. In addition, development of the long tree-ring record will
              involve cross-dating of trees killed by advances of Columbia and other glaciers
              around Prince William Sound; interpretation of the dates of tree germination
              and death on these glacier forefields will enable glacier fluctuations in the
              region to be reconstructed with decadal precision.
