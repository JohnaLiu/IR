Abstract    :
              Nervous systems use electrical signals to transmit information.  Critical
for
              this process are proteins called ion channels that form pores
permitting ions
              to flow across cell membranes.  Modulation of ion channels
alters the
              electrical activity of an individual neuron and can produce
behavioral
              changes.  The long-range goals of this research are to
determine the function
              for a novel evolutionarily conserved family of
potassium ion channels, ether
              a-go-go (eag), to determine if they are
modulated by hormones and which ones,
              and to understand how these changes
produce behavioral plasticity in vivo.  A
              compelling model system for
these studies is metamorphosis of the tobacco
              hornworm Manduca sexta
because it permits analysis to be conducted at the
              level of identified
neurons whose developmental fates and behavioral roles are
              known.  This
system also will permit the use of hormonal manipulations to
              determine if
the endocrine system modulates the presence or activity of ion
              channels.
Standard molecular cloning techniques, molecular and
              immunochemical
cytological methods and quantification assays will be used. 
              Results from
these studies will contribute to our understanding of the roles
              and
regulation of this family of  potassium channels in electrical
              signaling
critical for the normal development and functioning of the nervous
              system.
