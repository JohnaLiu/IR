Abstract    :
              Recent studies suggest that estrogen can influence cognitive processes.
It is
              hypothesized that these effects are due, in part, to the ability of
estrogen
              to enhance the functional status of cholinergic projections to
the hippocampus
              and cortex by affecting cholinergic and GABAergic
neurons within specific
              regions of the basal forebrain.

The proposed studieson rats will use a
              combination of biochemical,
pharmacological, and behavioral techniques to
              examine the effects of
estrogen replacement on basal forebrain cholinergic
              neurons and
corresponding cognitive processes.  One major goal is to test
              the
hypothesis that estrogen replacement can reduce cognitive
              impairments
associated with the loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. 
              This
goal will be accomplished by examining the ability of
              estrogen
replacement to reduce impairments in learning, memory and
              attentional
processes produced by selective cholinergic lesions in rats. 
              Another
major goal is to examine the ability of estrogen to
              reduce
GABA-receptor-mediated effects on cholinergic activity.  This will
              be
accomplished using an in vivo microdialysis approach and examining
              the
ability of estrogen to prevent decreases in acetylcholine
              release
produced by lorazepam.
These studies will help provide an integrated,
              mechanistic account of
how estrogen replacement influences interactions
              between cholinergic and
GABAergic systems in the basal forebrain and
              hippocampus, and will help
to define potential mechanisms by which estrogen
              replacement can reduce
cognitive impairments associated with alterations in
              cholinergic and
GABAergic activity.
