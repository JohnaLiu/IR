Abstract    :
              Human beings, like all organisms that move in the world, must remember
the
              location of objects and goals in order to live successfully. Unlike
other
              organisms, human beings can learn about locations both
symbolically and
              through direct experience. The goal of this research
program is to understand
              the development of spatial competence.

Recent work has shown that many
              spatial skills arise earlier in
development than had hitherto been supposed.
              However, early success may
reflect the use of simple processes, different from
              mature coding,
rather than innate specification of spatial competence. Three
              sets of
studies will be carried out to address this general issue. In one
              line
of work, the focus is on the nature of infant location coding
              as
inferred from their looking times to events. In a second line of work,
the
              aim is to evaluate a recent claim that children show evidence of
              an
innately-specified "geometric module" in their searches for
              hidden
objects. The third line of work will examine how children use
              simple
maps to find hidden objects.

Finding evidence for developmental
              transformations in spatial
development as well as for strong initial starting
              points is important
theoretically, as it provides support for a position in
              which biological
specification and environmental interaction interact to
              produce
development. In practical terms, support for such a position
              would
indicate that certain environmental experiences may be necessary
              for
normal development, and could even be manipulated to allow
              optimal
development.
