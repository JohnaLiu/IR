Abstract    :
              This ESH project will test the hypothesis that millenial cooling events in the
              North Atlantic during the Holocene are caused by reduced meridional heat
              transport from the tropics.  High0accumulation-rate sediment cores from the
              Bahamas and the Brazil margin spanning thermocline depths (400-1000 m) will be
              analyzed at 250-year intervals for C and O isotopic composition of benthic and
              planktic foraminifera, with emphasis on the benthic 18 O data.  A temporal
              correlation between high-latitude, surface water cooling and low-latitude,
              thermocline warming at these sites will support the hypothesis.
