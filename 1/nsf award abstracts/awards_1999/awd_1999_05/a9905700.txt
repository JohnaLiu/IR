Abstract    :
              One of the chemosensory systems in the nose of vertebrates is called the
              vomeronasal system.  It is sometimes used for detecting pheromones in the
              environment, and in some reptiles it also is essential for prey detection.  In
              contrast to the regular sense of smell, very little is known about how the
              relevant chemical molecules trigger the intracellular response that leads to a
              nerve signal from the vomeronasal organ.  This step, called transduction, is a
              very active area of chemosensory research using modern biochemical approaches. 
              This project uses the garter snake as a model system having a high sensitivity
              to a chemoattractant molecule purified from earthworms, which are a favorite
              prey item.  Biochemical techniques are used to study how intracellular and
              extracellular levels of calcium ion may depend on a pathway involving a
              compound known as IP3 (inositol triphosphate).  IP3 is known in other signaling
              pathways to mobilize calcium, and this project will test how it works in the
              vomeronasal system.
    Results will be important for clarifying chemosensory
              transduction in this system that is ecologically important for detecting food
              as well as mates, and the work also will involve high school students in a
              research experience.
