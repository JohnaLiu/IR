Title: Vortex
              Interactions with Abrupt Topography

The proposed research will address the
              interaction of eddies and vortices with abrupt topographic features. The issues
              to be dealt are (1) the interaction of a seamount chain and meddies, (2) the
              interaction of a mean flow and a seamount chain, and (3) vortex and ring
              interaction with continental shelves and slopes. The principal tools will be
              analytical and numerical process models. The work is important because the
              result of the studies will impact areas such as the formation and maintenance
              of the Mediterranean salt tongue and the penetration of energy from the open
              ocean onto the shelf.
