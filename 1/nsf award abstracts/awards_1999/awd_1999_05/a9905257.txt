SBR-9905257
This project will study the causes and consequences of
              the slow-down in educational attainment that occurred for cohorts born after
              1950 in the United States. Among those born prior to 1950, each successive
              5-year cohort of young men had about a 2.5 percent higher college completion
              rate than the preceding one. This trend stopped and abruptly reversed with
              cohorts born after 1950. Even today, the school enrollment rates of 18-21 year
              old men have not yet resumed to the levels ofthe mid-1960s, when people born in
              the late 1940s were in school. A similar although less dramatic slowdown has
              affected the educational attainment of women.
Part I of the project will
              analyze the consequences of the slow-down and reversal in education trends
              across cohorts. Initial evidence from data over the 1975-95 period suggests
              that the shift in the supply of college graduates among younger cohorts of men
              can account for both the rapid rise in the relative returns to college for
              younger workers over the past decade, and for the overall rise in retums to
              college for all age groups from the mid-1970s to the mid-199Os. This project
              will develop and test alternative models of the link between age-group-specific
              returns to college and the relative supplies of college workers in a given age
              group, in other age groups, and in the economy as a whole. It will also
              investigate other potential explanations for the changing age structure of the
              returns to college, including demand-side explanations related to skill-biased
              technical change.
The second part of the project will study altemative
              explanations for the break in the trend of rising educational attainment
              between pre-1950 and post-1950 cohorts. Among the potential explanations that
              will be explored are the role of changing parental education and other family
              background characteristics; the effect of the G.I. Bill and veteran education
              benefits; the effect of Viet Nam-era draft policies; and the effect of supply
              constraints, caused by the relatively large size of the post-1950 cohorts and a
              relative slow down in investment in college and university infrastructure in
              the 1970s.
