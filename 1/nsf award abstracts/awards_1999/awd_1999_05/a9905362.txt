Abstract    :
              This project will explore the use of barite in deep-sea sediments to trace the
              variations in seawater [Sr] and [Ca] since the middle Cretaceous.  A suite of
              core tops will be analyzed to confirm that barite reliably records modern
              seawater concentrations.  Samples at roughly 1-2 million-year intervals will be
              analyzed from ODP cores in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans to determine whether
              the barite concentrations are globally consistent.  Selected samples will also
              be anlayzed for Sr isotopes, in order to correlate the sites to the lobal Sr
              isotopic record.
