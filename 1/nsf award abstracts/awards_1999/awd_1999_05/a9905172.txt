Abstract    :
              This Career Advancement Award is supported  by the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program.  Professor Allan D. Headley of the Department of Chemistry
              at Texas Tech University will use quantitative structure-activity relationships
              (QSAR) to determine and quantify the type of interactions that exist between
              the receptor site of neutrophil and conformationally mobile dipeptide
              chemoattractants.  He will carry out the synthesis of potential chemotactic
              dipeptides, determine conformations in solution, study their biological
              activities in collaboration with John McGlone of the Animal Sciences Department
              at Texas Tech, and then calculate a variety of MNDO molecular parameters in
              MOPAC.  Finally, he will apply these results to a QSAR analysis of the data in
              efforts to design more potent chemotactic agents.  

Knowledge of the
              conformation of individual amino acids gives information on possible
              conformation that peptides adopt.  Peptides and proteins must adopt specific
              conformations in order to be biologically active.  A goal of these studies is
              to develop theoretical models to predict the biologically-active conformation
              of small peptides.  These are fundamental studies which may ultimately lay the
              groundwork for the development of new anti-cancer agents.
