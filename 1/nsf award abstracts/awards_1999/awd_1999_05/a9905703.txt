Abstract    :
              	"Mexico 2000:  Voting, Campaign Effects, and Democratization" is designed to
              document campaign effects and voting behavior in Mexico's presidential
              elections of 2000.  Its imediate goal is to enhance knowledge of voting
              behavior and campaign effects in Mexico.  Its larger goal is to illuminate the
              impact of campaigns on electoral outcomes in contexts of weak partisan
              attachments, high uncertainty, and high stakes - that is, in the circumstances
              confronting most new democracies today.  As the first major study of its kind
              in an emerging democracy, it should prove valuable to a range of scholars
              interested in voting behavior, campaign effects, political communication, and
              democratization, regardless of their geographical specialization.

	The
              project consists of a combination of five panel and cross-sectional surveys
              over the course of the 2000 campaign in Mexico.  Each round of the survey is
              designed to measure different correlates of voting behavior (such as
              demographics, media exposure, political knowledge and engagement, opinion about
              salient public issues, attitudes toward the main parties and candidates, and
              impressionsof the electoral process) and different types of campaign effects
              (such as contact with party activists, media exposure and attention, political
              advertisements, and the presidential debate).  In all, the surveys cover more
              than 125 items for the 4,000 respondents interviewed twice and 70 items for
              those 2,000 respondents interviewed once.  Data generated by the project, along
              with the necessary background and technical information, are available publicly
              through the Harvard-MIT Data Cente,r the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the
              University of California at San Diego, and the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo
              de Mexico (ITAM) in Mexico City.
