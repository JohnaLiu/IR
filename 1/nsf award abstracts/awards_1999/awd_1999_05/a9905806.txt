Abstract    :
              The focus of this work is the development of Ru- and Mo-based chiral catalysts
              for enantioselective metathesis.  Polymeric Ru-based complexes that readily
              promote metathesis reactions and can be easily recovered will be prepared.
              Chiral Ru-based catalysts will be among those to be studied.  Chiral Mo-based
              catalysts will also be developed to be used in concert with Lewis acid
              co-catalysts.  The Mo-based complexes will be used to develop asymmetric
              catalytic ring-opening metathesis processes.

With this renewal award the
              Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.
              Amir H. Hoveyda of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College.  Professor
              Hoveyda will focus his work on the development of synthetic methodology for the
              catalytic preparation of optically pure compounds.  Within this context,
              catalytic asymmetric metathesis reactions will be the focus.  The broad
              potential for the synthesis of complex molecules makes the work important to 
              the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and provides an excellent for
              the training of graduate students.
