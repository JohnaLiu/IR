Abstract    :
              This is a study of social networks in the plaintiff's personal injury bar. The
              plaintiff's personal injury bar may be characterized as the "ideal type"
              profession in terms of its relative autonomy. Compared to other sectors of the
              bar, plaintiff personal injury lawyers are more often solo and small-firm
              practitioners and are less client-dependent. Yet, preliminary research suggests
              that plaintiff personal injury lawyers are embedded in multiple social networks
              that support them in their practices. They are dependent on other lawyers both
              inside and outside the plaintiff's personal injury bar for case referral,
              advice, and the sharing of resources.

This research consists of in-depth
              interviews conducted with 60 Chicago area plaintiff personal injury lawyers.
              The sample includes both "low-end" and "high-end" personal injury lawyers along
              with personal injury "elites." Through a study of two different networks
              (advice and case referral) in two different strata (low-end and high-end) of
              the plaintiff's personal injury bar, this research explicates the role that
              networks play in this profession, how they are structured, and what it means to
              be embedded in a social networks in the practice of personal-injury law.
