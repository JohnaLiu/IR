Abstract    :
              The glaciation of East Antarctica and the associated shift to cold condition
              over high southern latitudes represents the most fundamental reorganization of
              the global climate-ocean system in the Cenozoic.  Determining the mechanisms
              responsible for the nucleation, development, and periodic fluctuations of the
              Antarctic ice sheet is important to our understanding of the global climate
              system and future climatic change.  The Cenozoic cooling trend from the warm
              "greenhouse" climate mode of the Early Eocene, to the "ice house" world of
              today, has long been recognized in paleontologic, isotopic, and sedimentologic
              evidence.  

This award supports designed to answer these question:  1) what
              long-term paleoenvironmental changes led to the growth of limited Antarctic ice
              during the mid-Late Eocene and 2) what triggered the rapid growth of the East
              Antarctic ice sheet in the earliest Oligocene (-33.7 ma).  A comprehensive
              investigation of Late Eocene/Early Oligocene climate echoing, designed to
              isolate the relative role of possible climate forcing mechanisms and feedbacks
              in the transition from a "greenhouse" to "icehouse"  world, will use the
              GENESIS Version 2.0 Global Climate Model, interactivity coupled to a predictive
              vegetation model (IBIS) and asynchronously coupled to a new high resolution
              dynamical ice sheet model specifically designed for GCM investigations of
              ice-sheet initiation and development.  A systematic series of sensitivity tests
              will assess the role of atmospheric CO2, orbital parameter,
              atmosphere-vegetation feedbacks, paleogeography, and ocean heat transport in
              the initiation and growth of glacial ice on Antarctica.
