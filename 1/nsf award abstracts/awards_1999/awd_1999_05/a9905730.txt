The proposed work is to utilize pore-scale numerical
              modeling (based on lattice Boltzmann methods) in order to determine the effects
              of pore-scale variability at the Darcy scale.  Specifically, the effects of
              redox conditions on the bioavailability and biodegradation of PCE in microdels
              will be so addressed.  If successful, fundamental information about transfer
              processes at the pore scale and implications for upscaling are expected to be
              the major technical contributions from this study.
