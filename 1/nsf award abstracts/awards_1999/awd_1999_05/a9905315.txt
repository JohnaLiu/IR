Abstract    :
              The overall goal of this research is to understand the relationship
              between
perception and action in the development of infant postural
              control.
Although the development of posture and locomotion has been
              well
documented, only recently has an understanding of the processes
              that
underlie these changes been sought.  This project
              examines
perception-action coupling as one of the processes that may
              contribute to
the observed changes.  The research is designed to examine the
              relationship
between perception and posture in three ways.  First, we propose
              to study
infants' postural development longitudinally from the onset of
              sitting to
three months after the onset of independent walking.  Second, we
              focus on
the role somatosensation plays in postural control.  And third, we
              measure
the coupling relationship between somatosensory input and the
              infant's
postural responses.  Infants will be tested sitting and standing in
              one of
3 conditions:  touching a fixed bar with the hand, no touch (hands
              free),
or touching a gently moving bar.  Relationships between the excursions
              of
the head, center of mass, and center of pressure as well as forces
              applied
at the hand will be analyzed.  Data are expected to provide
              critical
information about the study of normal infant postural development as
              well
as to lay a foundation for understanding those infants with abnormal
              or
delayed postural development.
