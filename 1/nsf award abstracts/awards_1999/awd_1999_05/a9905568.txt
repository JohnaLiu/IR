Abstract    :
              	This proposal seeks funding to continue research on political violence in
              Africa.  With funding from a previous NSF grant, Robert H. Bates assembled a
              research team of fellow scholars and graduate students.  Among its major
              accomplishments were the collection and dissemination of a comprehensive set of
              political and economic data.  A major purpose of the second grant is to keep
              this team intact, so as to complete the analysis of these data and secure their
              publication.
	More specifically, two objectives motivate this work.  The first
              is to complete the analysis of data collected on the political economy of 46
              African states over the 1970-95 period, as financed by the earlier grant.  The
              second is to move from the creation of this regional dataset to the creation of
              an international data bank.  Drawing on the experience gained from the project
              thus far and mobilizing the resources of the Web, we aim to develop a
              technology that, among other  things, will promote a constructive interaction
              between area specialists and those engaged in the broader comparative study of
              politics.
