Food-web theory is undergoing a paradigmatic shift from
              scale-invariant patterns in food webs to constant connectance and
              scale-dependent patterns. This postdoctoral starter grant will clarify the
              currently undetermined biological significance of the shift by rigorously and
              systematically comparing empirically observed food web patterns with patterns
              generated by null and mechanistic models. As a rich history in ecology has
              shown, such comparisons are critical to evaluating the claim that robust food
              web patterns are indicative of powerful biological processes that constrain the
              structure and function of ecological systems. Lacking the comparisons, the
              hypothesis that food web patterns are methodological artifacts needs to be
              systematically studied before much work on the biological basis for the
              patterns is warranted. The relatively small amount of previous work comparing
              natural and null food webs suggests that biological processes are responsible
              for the relatively low value of connectance in a wide range of terrestrial,
              aquatic and marine ecological systems. In an attempt to delineate the processes
              responsible for this and other food web patterns, candidate biological
              mechanisms will be formalized into computer models that construct food webs.
              Webs constructed in this manner will be compared against empirically observed
              food webs. This comparison will indicate whether the simulated mechanisms
              deserve further analytical and experimental investigation as potential sources
              of food web patterns.
