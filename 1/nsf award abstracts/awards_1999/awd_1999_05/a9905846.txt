Abstract    :
              The proposed exploratory research  will incorporate a new numerical model for
              sea ice dynamics into the NCAR CSM. The new model is computationally efficient
              because it uses the alternating directions implicit (ADI) technique to directly
              solve the sea ice momentum equations without iterations. The model may be well
              suited for parallel computing. In addition, the model approaches true plastic
              solution, which is important for accurate prediction of ice motion, deformation
              and stress. The work is important because success in implementing the ADI model
              in the CSM is likely to enhance the science community's ability to simulate and
              predict the earth's climate system.
