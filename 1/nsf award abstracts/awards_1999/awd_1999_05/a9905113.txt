Lay Summary.   The brain contains high levels
              of gangliosides, natural compounds that are important constituents of the cell
              membranes.  However, the physiological role of gangliosides in the brain is not
              fully understood.  Experimental data have shown that GM1, the prototype of
              gangliosides found in the brain, promotes neuronal differentiation, maturation
              and growth.  The overall goal of this proposal is to examine the molecular
              mechanisms by which gangliosides influence structure and function of neurons. 
              The properties of GM1 demonstrate striking similarities to neurotrophic
              factors, especially the neurotrophins, endogenous substances that are required
              for an appropriate brain development and function.  This proposal main working
              hypothesis is that gangliosides enhance neuronal function by interacting with
              the neurotrophins and in particular their receptors.  Using cell lines which
              express each of the neurotrophin receptors, this proposal will investigate: 1)
              which neurotrophin receptor subtype is activated, 2) which portion of the
              ganglioside molecule is involved in this activation, and 3) which region of the
              receptor is activated by gangliosides.  This proposal will provide new
              discoveries in the field of ganglioside biology and brain function.
