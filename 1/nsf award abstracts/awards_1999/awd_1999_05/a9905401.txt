Abstract    :
              European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), like other temperate zone
              songbird
species, breed seasonally.  Surprisingly, it was discovered
              previously that
these seasonal changes in reproductive activity are associated
              with marked
changes in the morphology of brain areas that regulate singing
              behavior.
Increases in the volumes of song control brain areas in the spring
              largely
depend upon seasonal increases in circulating testosterone.  Recent
              studies
suggest that there are gonad- and testosterone-independent seasonal
              changes
in the volumes of song nuclei.  Our initial findings indicate that
              the
hormone melatonin might mediate these testosterone-independent changes
              in
the song system.  Melatonin concentrations in plasma are high during
              the
dark phase of the circadian cycle.  This results in a seasonal change
              in
the pattern of secretion; longer durations of high melatonin in fall
              and
winter and short durations of high melatonin in spring and summer. 
              The
experiments described in this proposal will test the role of melatonin
              in
regulating seasonal changes in birdsong.  These experiments include
              the
manipulation of endogenous melatonin via the removal of the pineal gland
              as
well as the direct infusion of melatonin into brain areas controlling
              song.
Changes in the morphology of the song nuclei and in song behavior will
              be
measured.
