              ABSTRACT
EEC-9905711
NANNI

Structural retrofit and reinforcing work has
              become important because of the aging buildings and civil infrastructure. 
              Considerable work has been accomplished addressing this problem, but industry
              is recognizing that more research and development is necessary to directly
              address the material performance in the field.  A planning grant (EEC-9812669)
              was awarded to the University of Missouri Rolla to determine the feasibility
              and viability of forming an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              (I/UCRC) for the Repair of Buildings and Bridges with Composites.  

The
              Center's research agenda will address:  1).  Strengthening of Existing RC
              Joists with FRP Rods and Sheets, 2.) Strengthening Unreinforced Walls with FRP
              Material Systems, 3.) Confinement of Rectangular RC Columns Using FRP Jackets,
              4.) Bond and Failure Characteristics of Near Surface Mounted FRP Rods, 5.)
              Anchorage System for Externally Bonded FRP Laminates Using Near Surface Mounted
              FRP Rods.
