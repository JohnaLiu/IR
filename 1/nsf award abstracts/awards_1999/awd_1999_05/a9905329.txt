Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support to produce a 1000-year record of typhoon
              landfalls for the entire coastal zone of China based on historical documentary
              data. The abundance of historical documentary records in the form of local
              county gazettes and natural disaster chronicles in China offers an excellent
              opportunity for extending the climatic record beyond the period of instrumental
              observation to centuries or even millennia before present. Similar to what we
              have recently accomplished in a pilot study for the Guangdong Province, this
              paleoclimatic time-series will consist of year-by-year, county-by-county
              inventories of typhoon strikes for all the coastal provinces of China for the
              last 1000 years. This will be the longest documentary record of tropical
              cyclone activity in the world, even though the data are expected to be more
              continuous and complete only for the last 500 years.
