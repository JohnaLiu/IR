Abstract    :
              Rule-Bound and Autonomous:
Specifying the Conditions for the Successful
              Implementation of the 
Worldwide Quality Assurance Standard ISO9000

The aim
              of this project is to develop an explanation for the conditions under which
              ISO9000, the world's most popular quality assurance and management system is
              likely to have a positive effect on organizational performance.  During the
              last several years, there has been a huge campaign for organizations to seek
              and obtain certification.  Over 300,000 organizations around the world already
              have been certified and nearly the same number are in the process of doing so. 
              Despite ISO9000's immense popularity, existing research has not found a
              definitive impact on performance.  Our research will explore the claim that
              when organizations more effectively combine rules and autonomy they are more
              likely to successfully implement the ISO9000 standard. 
Organizations appear
              to require an appropriate mix of rules and autonomy.  Increasingly, business
              strategists are advising managers to combine the right level of these elements.
               Organization theory, however, does not provide clear guidance about how these
              elements should coexist. 
We will investigate the claim that the more
              organizations exercise choice within a situation of constraints the more they
              are likely to successfully implement ISO9000.  By autonomy we mean having
              intrinsic reasons for adopting ISO9000 and going beyond what the rules require.
               The motivations for adhering to ISO9000's rules often are extrinsic, as
              demanding customers, who refuse to purchase from any but certified suppliers,
              impose the standard on suppliers.  The degree to which extrinsic motivations
              are combined with intrinsic ones, such as achieving better supply chain
              efficiencies, needs to be better understood. 
National culture is likely to
              have a moderating effect on autonomy.  In cultures that are more
              individualistic, less hierarchical, and more tolerant of ambiguity, the effects
              of autonomy are likely to be enhanced, while in cultures with the opposite
              characteristics these effects will be reduced. 
The work we propose is
              exploratory in nature and aims to refine and develop hypotheses about the
              effects of rules, autonomy, and national culture on ISO9000 implementation. 
              The case studies will assess the mechanisms, processes and context of
              implementation of ISO900 including the effects of organizational culture,
              systems, and other factors. 
This project is a cooperative effort involving an
              inter-disciplinary team from the U.S. (University of Minnesota) and other
              countries.  The Juran Center for Quality Leadership at the Carlson Business
              School at the University of Minnesota is taking the lead role.
