Abstract    :
              	The purpose of this research is to explore managers' perceptions of legal
              liability and a range of organizational innovations--which may be called
              "legalized" structures, policies, and procedures--associated with threats of
              liability. Several significant questions are investigated: 1 ) How widespread
              is the phenomenon of administrative legalization? 2) What factors--including,
              but not limited to, managers' perceptions of liability--best explain the
              diffusion of legalized administrative forms among organizations? 3) What are
              the key influences on managers' perceptions of the threat of liability? 4) To
              what extent (if at all) do legalized administrative forms enhance protection
              for rights in practice? These questions will be answered using a survey of
              managers of city personnel departments, parks and recreation departments, and
              police departments in a wide range of cities, supplemented by additional data. 
              The result will be the first nationwide data base on organizational,
              perceptual, and legal variables regarding civil liability as a means of
              regulation.  The study will increase our understanding of whether and how the
              system of regulation by lawsuit "works."
