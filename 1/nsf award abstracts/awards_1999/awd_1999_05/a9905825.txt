Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a workshop titled Hybrid Technologies for
              Waste Minimization to be held July 15-16, 1999 at the Beaver Run Resort and
              Conference Center in Breckenridge, Colorado.  The purpose of the workshop is to
              stimulate research into design methodologies/concepts that have the potential
              for leading to waste minimization in chemical process design and manufacturing.
               This is an important workshop for advancing aspects of this field as well as
              the strategic goals of the participating programs in CTS.
