Abstract    :
              Using counties as the unit of analysis, this project examines the spatial and
              temporal patterning of disaster events and losses in the United States for the
              past fifty years.  The primary purpose is to assess whether these losses are
              equally distributed over space and by social group to see if some regions and
              social groups are more affected than others.  Three broad research questions
              are posed: (1) What are the spatial and temporal variations in hazard events
              and losses over time?  Are some places more disaster-prone than others?  Is
              this due to a singular event with large direct losses or is it more a function
              of smaller, more frequent events whose cumulative losses add to larger sums? 
              (2) Are there differences in the broad demographic characteristics of
              disaster-prone versus non disaster-prone places?  Are disaster-prone places
              more likely to have low income and minority populations or moderate/high income
              mostly white residents?  (3) Does the impact of losses differ from place to
              place, if so, where are the burdens the greatest and why?  What
              socio-historical processes (e.g., demographic shifts, in-migration,
              urbanization) can help to explain the observed pattern of inequities?
