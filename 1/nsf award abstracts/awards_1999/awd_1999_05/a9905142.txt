Abstract    :
              The proposed research concerns a study of remediation techniques for asphaltenes
              from crude oil.  Asphaltenes are aromatic condensed ring compounds with short
              aliphatic chains attached to polar heteroatoms like sulfur.  Their
              precipitation in processes related to crude oil production is problematic. 
              This results in the inefficient recovery of oil from rock formations as well as
              in difficulties processing the oil downstream from the well head.  The use of
              solvents like toluene has been a traditional approach for dissolving
              asphaltenes but these solvents are falling into disrepute because of their
              adverse environmental effects.  More recently, amphiphile-based alkane fluids
              have been proposed as improved solvents for asphaltene remediation and this
              topic forms the basis for the proposed research project.
