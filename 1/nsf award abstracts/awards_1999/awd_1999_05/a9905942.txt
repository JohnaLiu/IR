This Americas Program award will support travel and related
              expenses for five US scientists and 2 postdoctoral students, to participate in
              an international workshop on iron and copper homeostasis, to be held in Pucon,
              Chile, November 16-19, 1999.  Organizers are Dr. Jonathan Glass, Louisiana
              State University, Shreveport and Dr. Marco T. Nunez, University of Chile.  The
              workshop will take place in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the Biology
              Society of Chile, and is designed to bring together scientists with an interest
              in molecular aspects of iron and copper transport and metabolism.  It has been
              noted that although copper and iron metabolism are intimately related, the
              scientists of both fields rarely communicate.  Therefore, a better
              understanding of iron-copper interaction would foster knowledge in iron and
              copper metabolism, and would establish future avenues of collaborative
              research.  

Besides fomenting interactions between scientists, and
              strengthening international scientific collaboration, the workshop will enable
              US and Chilean scientists and students to become aware of the newer molecular
              developments in this area of research. The attendance of leading scientists in
              the field from both US, and outstanding Latin American laboratories is likely
              to lead to closer integration of research efforts In addition to the US and
              Latin American participants, the workshop will congregate a worldwide assembly
              of leading scientists in the field, including scientists from Europe, Israel
              and Japan.
