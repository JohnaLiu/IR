This award provides support
              for the establishment on the Berkeley campus of MOSIS++, an enhanced hardware
              testbed for rapid prototyping that will allow remote users to use the facility
              for fabricating and rapid prototyping of their designs using different
              processes.  The testbed, an extension of the CyberCut project (a networked
              manufacturing service for rapid part design and fabrication on the Internet)
              will allow the rapid manufacture and physical prototyping of hybrid systems
              typical of consumer electronics products.  Educational materials will be
              developed and made available to other universities who wish to use MOSIS++
              capabilities to teach product design and manufacturing of small
              electromechanical products in computer science and engineering courses.
