Abstract    :
              Cx43 gap junctions play an indispensible role in cardiac morphogenesis, as
null
              mutant or knockout mice deficient in Cx43 gap junctions die at birth
from
              cardiac defects involving the right ventricular outflow tract (Reaume
et al.,
              1995). Using transgenic mouse models to manipulate Cx43 function,
Dr. Lo has
              determined that the requirement for Cx43 gap junctions in heart
morphogenesis
              involves the cardiac neural crest cells (Ewart et al., 1997;
Sullivan et al.,
              1998). Her studies indicated that Cx43 gap junction
communication modulates
              neural crest cell migration. In the next funding
period, she proposes to
              investigate the HYPOTHESIS that in crest cells,
signal transduction cascades
              triggered by growth factor/integrin signaling
generate second messengers that
              are mobilized through Cx43 gap junction
channels, and in this manner, gap
              junction communication may help regulate
and coordinate the migration of
              cardiac neural crest cells.  In Aim 1, she
will characterize the in vitro
              migratory behavior of cardiac crest cells
upon growth factor stimulation and
              matrix binding, and determine whether
gap junction communication may be
              altered in parallel with changes in crest
cell migration.  In Aim 2, she will
              examine whether changes in the level of
gap junction communication may affect
              growth factor/integrin signaling and
the migration of cardiac crest cells. In
              Aim 3, she will use knockout mouse
models to further examine the role of Cx43
              gap junctions in mediating
endothelin/PDGF signaling in cardiac neural crest
              cells in the developing
embryo. For these studies, she will intercross mice
              harboring the endothelin
receptor A (ET-A) or platelet derived growth factor a
              receptor (PDGFaR)
knockout alleles with the Cx43 knockout mice.  If gap
              junction
communication has a role in endothelin or PDGF signaling in cardiac
              crest
cells, then compound heterozygous animals with a decrease in Cx43
              function
and a decrease in PDGFaR or ET-A receptor function may exhibit
              cardiac
defects similar to those found in the homozygous knockout
              animals.
Ultimately these studies should pave the way towards the
              identification of
the signaling molecules traversing through gap junctional
              channels, and
thus help elucidate on the molecular level, the role of gap
              junctions in
neural crest migration.
