Abstract    :
              This award will support the continued development and maintenance of SIOSEIS, a
              software package for enhancing and manipulating marine seismic data.  SIOSEIS
              is the only package that runs on SUN, HP, SGI and Dec Alpha computers and is
              widely used by members of the marine geophysics community.
