The investigators propose to carry out a collaborative,
              multidisciplinary study of proposed compositional stratification in the
              lowermost ~1200 kilometers of Earth's mantle.  The investigators hypothesize
              that the existence of compositionally distinct regions can reconcile
              observational constraints from seismological, geochemical, heat flow, and other
              geophysical observations into a unified model of the dynamics of the deep
              mantle. Preliminary numerical models imply that a hot abyssal layer of material
              that is intrinsically about 5% more dense than the overlying mantle is
              dynamically stable, though its surface develops hundreds of kilometers of
              topography.  The proposed work uses numerical models of thermochemical
              convection in 2-D and 3-D, seismological modeling of structure in the deep
              mantle, and calculations of model seismic velocities and other geophysical
              observables resulting from the numerical experiments to test this idea.
