Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop the hyperbolic relaxed eddy
              accumulation technique for measurements of biosphere-atmosphere exchange of
              isotopomers of carbon dioxide (CO2), such as 13CO2 and C18OO. If these
              measurements can be carried out successfully, they can be used to partition net
              ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) into the photosynthetic and respiratory components
              and an independent examination of the response of these opposing processes to
              environmental forcings. The project will focus on an initial field feasibility
              analysis. Measurements will be made at a coniferous forest at Niwot Ridge,
              Colorado, and a grassland site in Lethbridge, Alberta.
This project is
              supported jointly by the Divisions of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and the
              Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology through the Environmental
              Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry Program (EGB).
