This proposal describes a three-year program for the
              investigation of improved terahertz optoelectronic technology and its
              applications in medical and biological imaging, a continuation of the work
              supported previously by NSF CAREER Award. In the last four years, the PI has
              built a state-of-the-art terahertz imaging system and demonstrated its
              applications in several areas, and created innovations in various aspects of
              terahertz generation and detection techniques, including single shot imaging
              and enhancement of THz generation from semiconductors in a strong magnetic
              field, The primary goal of this proposal is to extend the capability of the
              terahertz-imaging instrument with a spatial resolution exceeding 400x600 pixels
              at video frame rate. This would expand the performance of the instrument by
              orders of magnitude and hence greatly increase its utility.
