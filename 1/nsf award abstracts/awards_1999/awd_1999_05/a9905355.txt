Recommended Project is for a multichannel seismic (MCS)
              survey of the subducting ocean crust off the coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica
              in support of both SEIZE and Subduction Factory objectives in this Margins
              program study area.  The primary objective is to characterize the changing
              structural nature of the subducting Cocos plate, and to try to relate these
              changes to known chemical segmentation of the volcanic arc, best shown by
              ratios such as Ba/La that reflect relative changes in material input into the
              subduction zone. The MCS survey will be supplemented by three wide-angle, ocean
              bottom hydrophone (OBH) refraction lines, two perpendicular and one parallel to
              the trench, as well as by Hydrosweep swath bathymmetry, gravity, and magnetics
              data.  This proposed study is part of a larger, international effort, using the
              German research vessel R/V Sonne.  The MCS and Hydrosweep surveys would be
              conducted aboard the R/V Maurice Ewing, using its 6 km-long streamer. The R/V
              Sonne will be used to supply, deploy and recover the OBH's, which will
              themselves be supplied by GEOMAR.
