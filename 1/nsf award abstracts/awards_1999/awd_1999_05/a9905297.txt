Research for Better Schools (RBS), in collaboration with the
              Appalachia Education Laboratory (AEL), will design and conduct a Curriculum
              Showcase Conference focused on K-12 mathematics and science projects sponsored
              by the National Science Foundation.  The target audience (500 participants are
              anticipated) is district math and science coordinators, state policymakers,
              members from state affiliate professional groups, teachers, and those involved
              in preservice and inservice teacher programs in the Mid-Atlantic region.  The
              collective states served by the two sponsoring organizations are: DC, DE, KY,
              MD, NJ, PA, TN, VA, and WV.

Conference goals are to  (1) focus participants
              on mathematics and science improvement through providing direct experiences
              with standards-based curricula; and  (2) provide participants with access to
              resources for additional information about particular curriculum projects.
