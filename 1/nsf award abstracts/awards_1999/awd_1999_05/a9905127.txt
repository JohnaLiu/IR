Abstract    :
              Kocher 9905127  Cichlid fishes have undergone an extraordinary adaptive
              radiation into more than one thousand species in the lakes of East Africa.  Key
              to their success has been the diversification of their oral jaws, which allows
              them to adopt specialized modes of feeding.  Little is known about the genetic
              basis for these differences in jaw morphology.   How many genes control the
              differences in oral jaw shape?  Are the same genes involved in different
              structures of the head?  What kinds of genes control the shape of the jaw?  The
              genetic factors controlling differences in jaw morphology will be studied in a
              hybrid cross between two Lake Malawi species with radically different jaws. 
              The morphology of a large family of F2 animals will be characterized and each
              animal genotyped for 100 DNA markers distributed across the genome.  By
              analyzing the effects of particular marker alleles on jaw shape it will be
              possible to estimate the number,  mode of action (additive or dominant
              inheritance) and chromosomal position of genes contributing to each aspect of
              morphology.  This knowledge will contribute to the understanding of
              morphological diversification and its role in these remarkable vertebrate
              radiations.   In addition, many of the genes involved in jaw development in
              this model system are likely to be involved in the development of jaws in other
              vertebrates, including humans.
