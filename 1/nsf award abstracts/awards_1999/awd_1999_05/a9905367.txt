Spatial patterns in plant-insect interaction may be caused by
              variation among plants, among insects, or both. Often, the nature of the
              variation may produce the appearance that insects are variable, when in fact it
              is the plants that vary (or vice versa). In this SGER project, this
              investigator will tease apart the two variables to understand the cause of an
              apparent example of interdemic selection acting on butterfly diet. The result
              will tell us if interdemic selection really does act in this system. The
              importance of this project is that there are still no documented examples of
              interdemic selection in nature, for any trait of any organisms. This
              plant-herbivore system will provide the best opportunity yet to address this
              interesting and controversial research question.
