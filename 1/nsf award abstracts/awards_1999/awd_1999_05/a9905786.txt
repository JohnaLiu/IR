Abstract

This is an experimental investigation of the mechanisms
              of jet flame blowout and of the morphology of the reaction zone near blowout. 
              The effects of the dynamics of large-scale structures on flames near blowout is
              examined.  Measurements of the propagation rate of the flame zone relative to
              the fuel flow are made using simultaneous particle image velocimetry (PIV) and
              double-pulsed planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF).  The double-pulsed PLIF
              images of the CH radical provide information on the motion of the flamefront,
              while PIV provides information on the fuel velocity in the combustion zone. 
              Assessment of structures at the leading edge of the combustion zone near
              blowout is made using CH-PLIF.  Such visualizations are performed for a variety
              of flow conditions and downstream positions.  The effect of the air coflow
              velocity on flame blowout is assessed for a variety of fuels such as methane,
              ethylene, and propane.  Further studies are performed to contrast premixedness
              in the flowfields in near-field lifted flames to far-field flames with an
              emphasis on the mechanism of lifted diffusion flame stabilization and the
              transition to blowout.
