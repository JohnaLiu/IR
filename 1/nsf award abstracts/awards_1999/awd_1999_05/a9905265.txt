Abstract

The goals of this effort are to provide accurate data
              to facilitate improved models of metallic species in combustion processes and
              to enhance understanding of and predictive ability for the
              temperature-dependent kinetics of such processes.  Rate constants are
              determined in the temperature range of 300-1800 degrees K free from
              interference by other reactions that occur in flames by  using high-temperature
              fast-flow reactor (HTFFR) and high-temperature photochemistry (HTP) systems
              with products analyzed with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and mass
              spectrometry.  Past work concentrated on reactions of neutral atoms of toxic
              elements (chromium, tin, copper, cadmium, lead); this effort examines reactions
              of the neutral monochlorides and monoxides of those elements (and also mercury
              and barium) which are initial products of metal oxidation.  Also studied in
              this project are reactions of alkaline earth cations.

Metals play an
              important role in many combustion processes as additives, impurities, or fuel. 
              Current information of the kinetics of these processes is very limited. 
              Increasingly, however, toxic metal species from burning of coal, diesel
              engines, and incinerators are recognized as serious air pollutants
