Description:  This award supports the material sciences
              research entitled "US-India Cooperative Research: H2 Solubility as a Probe for
              Pd/Oxide Composites Prepared by Internal Oxidation of Pd Alloys."  The
              collaborators are Ted B. Flanagan, Department of Chemistry, University of
              Vermont and R. Balasubramaniam, Department of Materials and Metallurgical
              Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.  The goal of the research
              is to understand the relationship between the microstructure of materials and
              their properties such as H2 solubilities.  This project will explore the
              relationship by combining the expertise of the US PI in physical chemistry with
              that of the Indian PI in physical metallurgy in order to understand the
              characteristics of composite materials using H solubility as a probe and
              relating these to the microstructure. 

Scope:  Based on past successful
              collaboration that has produced three joint publications, there is every
              expectation that these researchers will continue to work fruitfully.  Flanagan
              with his students will carry out thermodynamic studies in the US and
              Balasubramaniam with his students will perform the microstructural
              characterization studies at the Advanced Centre for Materials Science at
              Kanpur.  This collaboration will benefit both educational institutions and
              provide an opportunity for the PIs students to gain a unique research
              perspective.  This joint effort is well balanced technically and should result
              in mutual benefits.
