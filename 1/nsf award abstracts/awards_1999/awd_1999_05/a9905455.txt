Abstract    :
              Funds are provided to hold a MARGINS theoretical and experimental school where
              the subduction zone will be the topic of a 4-day short course followed by a
              1-day workshop. The will support the emerging multi-disciplinary study of the
              subduction zone and focus on the geochemical and geodynamic processes at
              intermediate depths (50-150 km), a region where mass transfer plays a
              fundamental role in the evolution of subduction zones. A steering committee
              will select the speakers and attract participants. Funds will pay for full or
              partial travel of about 65 participants, although a total of 100 participants
              are expected.
