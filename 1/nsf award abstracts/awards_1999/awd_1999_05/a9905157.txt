Abstract    :
              This research explores differences in how men and women react to stress, with
              the goal of identifying how women's responses to stress may be
              health-protective. In a series of experimental investigations, men and women
              are asked to complete stressful tasks in the laboratory (such as giving a
              public speech and doing arithmetic in their heads). Physiological and
              neuroendocrine responses to stress, memory for stress-related material,
              anxiety, and affiliative/social responses to the stress are then examined. The
              main interest is in oxytocin, in conjunction with estrogen, which may account
              for the fact that women are substantially more likely to turn to others in
              response to stress, and which may, in turn, account for the fact that their
              physiological and neuroendocrine responses to stress are downregulated (i.e.,
              lessened in comparison with men's). These studies are important because they
              will help to identify responses to stress that are psychologically and
              physiologically protective and may point to interventions to improve both men's
              and women's responses to stress. These studies will be the first to examine the
              potential role of oxytocin and its enhancement by estrogen in accounting for
              women's greater social responses to stress and lesser physiological costs in
              response to stress.
