This research will investigate the role
              of mass transfer and surface reactions on the removal of calcium mineral films
              from stainless steel surfaces using sequestrant solutions in neutral and
              alkaline environments.  Three types of experiments will be used, that range
              from laboratory to industrial scale: (1) Batch dissolution studies.  In these
              experiments the dissolution of the mineral is investigated by suspending powder
              particles in the solution.  This experiment is not well-characterized from a
              mass transfer point of view, but it represents the standard study of
              dissolution kinetics found in the literature. (2) Dissolution from a rotating
              disk.  In this experiment a film of calcium mineral will be deposited on a
              stainless steel disk.  The film will be removed by continuously rotating the
              disk in the cleaning solution.  This experiment has a well-characterized mass
              transfer rate that is uniform over the whole surface of the film.  This will
              allow us to isolate the role of surface evolution of film morphology during the
              dissolution process. (3) Dissolution in turbulent pipe flow.  Here the cleaning
              rates under typical conditions will be quantified.
