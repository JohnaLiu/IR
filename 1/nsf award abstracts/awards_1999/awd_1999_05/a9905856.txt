The proposal describes a three-year program to investigate
              the details of non-radiative relaxation in solid-state materials using
              comprehensive characterization of local modes and phonon modes coupling
              pathways and different parameters affecting these interactions. Flourescence
              lifetime measurements, resonance Raman scatering, off-resonant Raman
              scattering, up-converted hot luminescence measurements and time resolved Raman
              measurements will be used to assess the overall and local effects of
              nonradiative processes taking place in the Cr4+ impurity-doped host materials. 
              These measurements will be able to pinpoint the major factors responsible for
              the relaxation, and thus lead to help develop high performance light sources
              and optical materials.
