Abstract    :
              
Annually laminated sediments (varves) from lakes provide a unique vehicle to
              acquire continental paleoclimatic data with secure chronologies.  This proposal
              seeks to analyze varved sediments from four Minnesota lakes for a suite of
              geochemical, sedimentological, and biological proxies to assess Holocene
              climatic variability in the midcontinent of North America.  These proxies
              include varve thickness, organic and inorganic carbon, detrital minerals,
              mineralogical composition, grain size, oxygen and carbon isotopes of carbonates
              and ostracode shells, trace-element composition of ostracode shells, and
              pollen.  The research objectives are: (1) Calibrate various climatic proxies in
              varved sediments with instrumental weather data for the last 100 years to
              evaluate how each proxy is related to climatic factors, (2) Assess Holocene
              climatic variations, particularly cyclic and abrupt changes, by interpreting
              proxy records from our study sites on the basis of calibration results, (3)
              Integrate new varved-sediment data with findings from other high-resolution
              paleoclimatic studies in adjacent areas to provide a regional synthesis of
              Holocene climatic variations, (4) Compare patterns of climatic fluctuations in
              the midcontinent of North America with those in Greenland, the North Atlantic,
              and other parts of the globe to evaluate mechanisms of Holocene climatic
              variability.
