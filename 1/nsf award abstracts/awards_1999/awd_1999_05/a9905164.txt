Abstract    :
              The objectives of this study are to 1) help constrain the Miocene uplift history
              of the Northern Andes by collecting, age-dating, and analyzing the Miocene
              Jadibamba flora from the Altiplano of northern Peru and 2) increase the
              accuracy of the leaf morphology climate and elevation proxy by collecting and
              analyzing 15 modern vegetation samples from the eastern lowlands and eastern
              slope of the Andes, Peru.  This study addresses the objectives of the Earth
              System History program by providing 1) well-dated, quantitative, terrestrial
              paleoclimate proxy data which can be used to evaluate the results of general
              circulation models, 2) topographic and vegetation boundary conditions for
              general circulation models, and 3) an improved calibration between leaf
              morphology and climate, which will increase the accuracy of this climate and
              elevation proxy.
