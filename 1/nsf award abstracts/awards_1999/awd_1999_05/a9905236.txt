CROSS


This planning grant funds the University
              of Arkansas for industry/university interactions to determine the feasibility
              and viability of becoming a research site of the Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Separations Using Thin Films.  The
              Co-Directors of the site would be Dr. Robert Cross and Dr. Robert
              Beitle.

The University of Arkansas expertise will broaden the Center's
              research base by addressing research in bioprocessing; chemical, biochemical
              and microbiological analysis; food and beverage processing; UF and MF process
              design modeling and optimization; water purification and environmental
              applications; and catalytic membrane reactors.
