              The UCSC Kestrel Server: Remote Parallel Processing and Computational
              Biology

This award provides support for high-speed computational biology
              servers using remote parallel processing architectures based on the University
              of California, Santa Cruz Kestrel Parallel Processor.  This computational
              infrastructure will focus on the sequence analysis needs of the Human Genome
              Project and the general field of computational biology.  A number of access
              servers will be developed and made available on the Web as a resource for
              researchers in the field.  The University will develop outreach materials and
              activities to encourage smaller institutions to use Kestrel.
