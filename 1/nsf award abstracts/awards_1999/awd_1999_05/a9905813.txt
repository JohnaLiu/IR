Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks support for a field and laboratory research program on Lake
              Elgygytgyn, a meteorite-impact crater lake 100 km north of the Arctic Circle in
              northeastern Russia. The project aims to complete paleolimnological studies of
              exiting sediment cores and to study the modern limnological conditions in the
              lake, as part of a multidisciplinary, multiproxy-method approach to
              reconstructing past conditions in the area. The project also includes an
              independently funded seismic survey of the lake in preparation for a future
              deep drilling program to recover the entire 3.6 million year record contained
              in sediments in the lake.
