A new quantitative microscopy technique for simultaneous
              mapping of both the nano-scale elastic properties and the van der Walls forces
              on the surface of a material will be developed under an SGER award.  No such
              technique is currently available. The technique is based on scanning probe
              microscopy combined with ultrasonic excitation of the probe tip.  This will
              allow quantitative information to be extracted from the image.  At present
              nano-scale elasticity mapping is based on using the tapping mode of a scanning
              probe microscope. This method is purely qualitative and is limited to compliant
              materials only. The current state-of-the-art microscopy for imaging van der
              Walls forces requires a dielectric immersion medium.  This will not be
              necessary under the new technique. 

The specimen under examination will be
              excited using an ultrasonic signal with frequency higher than several MHz. At
              this frequency range the tip will not be able to follow the surface
              displacement caused by the elastic stress wave because of the inertia of the
              cantilever. A signal modulation technique will be developed to enable
              acquisition of images and force measurements at these high frequencies at the
              point where the tip and the sample are just losing contact.
