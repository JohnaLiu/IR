              Abstract

This proposal requests support for a study to combine data from many
              cores from the Blake-Bahama Outer Ridges and the adjacent slope, within the
              intermediate  (~l500m) to deep (~4700m) ocean, in order to assemble a
              paleohydrography along the western boundary of the Atlantic. This, combined
              with nearby data from the depth range 400m to 1500m at Little Bahama Bank, will
              form the most detailed and extensive paleohydrography for any ocean basin.  For
              this project, carbon isotopes in benthic foraminifera will be the main tracer
              for paleonutrients, and the age difference between paired benthic and
              planktonic radiocarbon analyses will be a ventilation tracer.  These tracers
              will be applied to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) level in the core collection
              to determine the extent of frontal changes between deep and intermediate depth
              water masses   They will also be applied to the millennial-scale event of about
              11,000  14C yrs ago (known as the Younger Dryas) to compare millennial-scale
              with orbital-scale (LGM) hydrographic changes.  Finally, the extent of
              millennial scale hydrographic changes will be evaluated during isotope Stage 3
              (~30 to 60 kyr before present) when climate cycled rapidly and repeatedly.
