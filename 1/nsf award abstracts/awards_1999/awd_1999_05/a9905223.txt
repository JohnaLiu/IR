The 12th International Conference on Dynamical Processes in
              Excited States of Solids (DPC'99) will be held on May 24-28, 1999 in Puerto
              Rico.  The goal of the conference is to provide a forum for the exchange of
              scientific ideas and technological advances in a variety of organic and
              inorganic condensed systems.  The NSF funds will be used to support the
              attendance of young American Scientists.

Puerto Rico itself will greatly
              benefit by hosting such a high profile international meeting.  Great potential
              for technological opportunities exist primarily in the area of communications
              that are based on solid state materials.
