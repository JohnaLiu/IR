Metadata for Resources Discovery of Multimedia Digital
              Objects

This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award. 
              This project, HARMONY, is a three-way international partnership between Cornell
              University, the Australian Distributed Systems Technology Centre(DSTC) and the
              University of Bristol's Institute for Learning and Research Technology(ILRT). 
              The joint work will be devising a framework to deal with the challenge of
              describing networked collections of highly complex and mixed-media digital
              objects. The work will draw together efforts on the RDF, XML, Dublin Core and
              MPEG-7 standards, and will focus on the problem of allowing multiple
              communities of expertise (e.g., library, education, rights management) to
              define overlapping descriptive vocabularies for annotating multimedia content.
