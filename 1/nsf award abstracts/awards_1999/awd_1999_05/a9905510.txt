This project examines what happened to the theme of "ending
              hunger" as a mobilizing idea, value and goal for the late twentieth century. 
              It explores how the "ending hunger" theme became important to  many private
              voluntary organizations during the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Hunger Project
              and Food First, and traces how these institutions evolved.  The project also
              examines a decline in anti-hunger efforts in the late 1990s.  The overall goal
              is to understand how individual moral values and commitments are translated
              into successful social movements, and to understand the reasons for a decline
              in "ending hunger" activities, partly as internal structural organizational
              factors and partly from external world system changes.  
The questions will be
              addressed through construction of detailed case histories of four anti-hunger
              non-governmental organizations, the Hunger Project, the Brown University World
              Hunger Program, Second Harvest, and Food First, considered against a backdrop
              of changing world political and economic conditions and the changing agendas of
              the UN and other government and non-government agencies.  The time frame will
              cover the twenty five years from the World Food Conference of 1974 to the
              present.  The resulting analysis will be valuable to planners, public
              officials, and members of organizations interested in understanding the rise
              and fall of different sorts of social action agendas.  The case studies will
              represent valuable knowledge for other studies of changes in societal efforts
              to ameliorate social problems.
