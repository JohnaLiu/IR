An International Symposium on "Nonthermal
              Medical/Biological Treatments Using Electromagnetic Fields and Ionized Gases"
              will be held in Norfolk, VA, April 12-14, 1999. The symposium is intended to
              bring together scientists of various background -engineers, physicists,
              biologist, and clinicians - to exchange their experience in the field on
              nonthermal bioelectro-technologies and to explore the opportunities in this new
              research area. The symposium will provide an excellent opportunity to make
              graduate students in engineering and science aware of the potential of this new
              interdisciplinary research field and to convince them to enter this field. In
              order to allow young researchers without regular income, particularly graduate
              students, to attend the symposium we plan to offer travel support to a selected
              group of students.
