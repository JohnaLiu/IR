Abstract    :
              This proposal describes research into the synthesis and characterization of
              hybrid inorganic-organic membranes (polyimide-silica materials) for use in
              chemical separations.  The area of hybrid materials has begun to attract the
              attention of the research community in recent years, because it promises to
              bring the best characteristics of each precursor material to the hybrid
              compound.  Inorganic materials have the ability to show high selectivities, are
              resistant to corrosive environments, but difficult to process into versatile
              mechanical structures.  Polymeric membranes do not show the same degree of
              selectivity as inorganic compounds, and are often thermally labile, but easier
              to process into convenient forms like hollow fibers-using injection moulding
              technology.  The key identified in this hybrid approach is to develop synthesis
              techniques that allow both the organic and inorganic precursor materials to
              form covalent crosslink
ages that will lead to stability of the resultant
              membranes.
