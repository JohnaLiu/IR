Abstract    :
              This project seeks to explore the interplay of recognition and redox processes,
              extending observations from the realm of host-guest chemistry into the arena of
              self-assembled monolayer surfaces (SAM's).  Assembled on a gold surface, these
              SAM's will be subject to a variety of characterization methods including
              grazing angle infrared spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.  Chemical
              modification of the surface will provide redox-functionalized moieties with the
              capability of binding specific guest molecules.  Subsequent redox chemistry
              will be studied in order to assess the feasibility of fabricating such devices
              as a molecular "shuttle" and to explore control of surface properties such as
              charge and hydrophobicity/philicity.  Ultimately, the creation of
              electronically responsive materials and devices may be possible.

With this
              Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research
              of Professor Vincent Rotello of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. 
              Professor Rotello's research involves the rational design of surfaces on a
              molecular level, using molecular assemblies that are electrically active.  The
              principles that are identified in these experiments may find applications in
              new electronic devices based on the controlled formation of surfaces with
              predetermined structures and properties that respond to electrical stimuli.
