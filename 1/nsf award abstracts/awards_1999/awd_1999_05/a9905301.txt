Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is the development of technology for the detection
              of food and water-borne pathogens through the use of responsive fish
              chromatophores.  To achieve this goal it is proposed to: (1) to entrap fish
              chromatophores (neuron-like cells that respond to the presence of microbial
              toxins by changing 
darkness and/or hue) with environmental samples into semi-
              permeable poly-L-lysine microcapsules constructed around a dissolvable alginate
              shell, thereby obtaining "snapshots" of information for toxicology monitoring;
              (2) to compare the performance of this technology to PCR and ELISA-based
              assays; and (3) to manufacture microfluid devices allowing magnetic capture of
              the microcapsules for maintenance of internal environment and measurement of
              culture parameters and cell responses.
