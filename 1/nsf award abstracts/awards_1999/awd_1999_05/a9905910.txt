This award provides supplemental funding to EAR 9814833 to
              support collaboration between Kent Murray, Department of Natural Sciences at
              the University of Michigan-Dearborn, and Zhou Xun, China University of
              Geosciences on the relationship between groundwater and surface water in urban
              watersheds.  Contaminated groundwater is a major national problem in both China
              and the US, and is particularly severe in urban areas. The goal of the project
              will be to evaluate the relationship between groundwater and surface water
              quality within an urban watershed in southeast Michigan and to eventually
              duplicate the research in an urban area of China that is experiencing rapid
              industrial growth.

Support on the Chinese side is provided by the National
              Natural Science Foundation of China and by the China University of
              Geosciences.
