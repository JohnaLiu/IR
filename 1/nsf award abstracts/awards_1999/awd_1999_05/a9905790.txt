In 1994, two deep seismic reflection
              profiles that image the entire crust across the continental junction between
              North America and Euraisa were acquired with National Science Foundation
              support.  They provide a unique crustal section which goes across an entire
              continent created by the major convergent tectonic processes that operated
              during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic.  A full interpretation of the deep seismic
              data must be processed and a structural contour map of the acoustic basement
              along the transect must be made.  A geologic and tectonic interpretation of the
              transect had been planned for the centerpiece of a Geological Society of
              America (GSA) Special Paper on the Bering Sea, but the graduate student who was
              supposed to do the interpretation and make the structural map did not do the
              work.  The Geology Department at Stanford University has a post-doctoral
              research affiliate who is currently available to make the full interpretation. 
              NSF support has been requested to complete the interpretation of  the seismic
              reflection profiles before the Bering Sea GSA Special paper is published in the
              summer of 1999.
