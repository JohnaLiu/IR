Abstract    :
              This project will use stable isotope measurements to provide novel information
              on the most important natural source of nitrous oxide (N2O), emissions from
              tropical soils. Preliminary measurements in tropical rain forest soils show
              considerable spatial variation in the isotopic composition of N2O emitted in
              the rainy season. It is hypothesized that the causes of spatial variability in
              N2O emissions reflect differences in microbial processes and physical
              transport. Measurements will be carried out in Brazil in collaboration with the
              NASA LBA program. The effect of nitrate fertilizer will be investigated.
              Laboratory incubation experiments will be aimed at a process-level
              understanding of denitrification. This project is supported jointly by the
              Divisions of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences through the Environmental
              Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry Program (EGB).
