Title:		Mate choice and

Previous field based findings on a monogamous,
              biparental termite reveal that both males and females are very choosy when
              seeking a lifetime partner.  Such partnerships last four to five years. Males
              prefer a female that is larger and reject small females.  Females prefer a male
              with large head width and will reject small-headed males. The proposed study
              explores the fitness benefits of choosiness for both males and females.  A
              field experiment will be conducted on 30 naturally-paired adults and 30
              experimentally-matched-paired adults.  Pairs of the two groups will be
              transplanted to logs and allowed to produce offspring over a six month period. 
              Following this period, Dr. Shellman-Reeve will determine which control and
              manipulated pairs have the highest (and lowest) indicators of fitness: adult
              survival, colony survival, offspring number and size, territory size, and
              paternity will be measured.  The study will show whether mate choice has a
              fitness benefit, and if so, whether the mate-choosiness is more important for
              females or for males.
	The proposed project tests a critical prediction of
              parental investment theory. Namely, when both males and females provide
              extensive care to offspring, both should be choosy when seeking their lifetime
              partner, particularly when mate-choosiness provides strong fitness benefits. 
              This planned investigation is certain to deepen our knowledge of mate choice in
              socially monogamous animals where both parents provide extensive care to
              offspring.
