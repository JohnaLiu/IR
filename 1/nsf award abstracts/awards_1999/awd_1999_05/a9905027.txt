	Charitable fund-raising institutions play an
              important role on the demand-side of the private provision of public goods. Not
              only do fund-raisers serve as a conduit for donor money, but they also provide
              important "social goods," such as prestige, pride, and social comparison, to
              donors by publicly announcing contributions. These social goods extend beyond
              the pure warm-glow of donation, and fund-raisers, knowing this, can
              strategically use this preference for social goods to increase contributions.
              Indeed, if having one's own contribution announced can increase the
              contributions of others, then there is an externality generated that makes both
              pure and impure altruists desire an institution that announces gifts and
              produces social goods.
            This study examines fund raising using
              theory and experiments. By varying the way contributions are announced in
              standard public goods experiments, these social effects can be explored in the
              laboratory. The first set of experiments will try to establish what the nature
              of these social goods are and how fund-raising institutions might manipulate
              these to increase contributions. The second set will introduce competition
              among charities by allowing them to offer different social goods. This project
              will provide insights into which social goods people prefer, which charities
              survive, and how contribution levels are affected. This research will provide a
              foundation for a continued research agenda of understanding the demand and
              supply sides of the charity market.
