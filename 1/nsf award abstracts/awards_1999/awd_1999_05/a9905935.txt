DLI-International: Emulation Options for Digital Preservation:
              Technology Emulation as a Method for Long-Term Access and Preservation of
              Digital Resources

This is the first year funding of a three year continuing
              award.  A team of researchers at the University of Michigan and research staff
              in the UK from the Cedars project, being run at the Universities of Leeds,
              Oxford and Cambridge under the aegis of CURL (Consortium of University Research
              Libraries) will investigate the potential role of emulation in long-term
              preservation of information in digital form.  The project will develop and test
              a suite of emulation tools, evaluate the costs and benefits of emulation as a
              preservation strategy for complex multi-media documents and objects, and
              develop models for collection management decisions about how much effort and
              resources to invest in exact replication within preservation activity. The
              project team will assess options for preserving the original functionality and
              "look and feel" of digital objects and develop preliminary guidelines for the
              use of different preservation strategies (conversion, migration and emulation).
