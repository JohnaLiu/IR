Abstract    :
              This award supports a study to develop CO measurements in our laboratory,
              focusing on identifying and eliminating potential sources of contamination.
              Preliminary measurements for specific periods of climatic interest to lay the
              groundwork for more comprehensive studies of CO records in ice cores will also
              be made. The proponents plan to test the following time periods:

1) The
              transition from the pre- to post-anthropogenic period (1500-1950 AD). This
              record will address the question of how the atmospheric CO concentration has
              changed with anthropogenic activity and verify the initial results of Haan et
              al. (1996) and Haan and Raynaud 1998.

2)	The last 20,000 years, including
              the re-industrial Holocene, the deglaciation, and the last glacial maximum.
              This record will address the question of how CO changed during periods of major
              climate change. Did CO behave like C02, which changed slowly on these time
              scales, or like CH4, which changed very quickly.

It is anticipated that the
              CO record, combined with existing or new data for C02, CH4, N20, and other
              paleoclimate variables, will provide further constraints on model studies of
              the effect of changing atmospheric chemistry on greenhouse forcing. This
              project furthermore contributes to areas of emphasis in the ESH program,
              including "compilation of high quality physical, chemical, and biological
              paleorecords focusing on climatic,  an environmental changes," and
              "quantification and development of biotic, physical, and geochemical proxy
              indicators for past Earth system processes.. ."
