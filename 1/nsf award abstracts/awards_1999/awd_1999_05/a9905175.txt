Abstract    :
              Feminist scholars have made important contributions to the understanding of the
              nature and causes of violence against women, but they are often vague about the
              direction of the causal effect.  The proposed study seeks to clarify the
              influence of females' labor force participation (proxy for gender inequality)
              on their physical, non-lethal, violent  victimization.  Using data from the
              1992-94 National Crime Victimization Survey in conjunction with data from the
              1990 Census of the United States' Population, the study will employ
              Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) procedures to investigate how gender
              inequality, social disorganization, racial residential segregation, and social
              class isolation interact with a number of individual and situational factors to
              augment females' violent victimization.
