              Abstract

This proposal requests funds to earn out the following
              investigations: (1) to measure the concentrations of cosmogenic radionuclide
              26Al (half-life = 0.7 my) in several composite Arctic and Antarctic Holocene
              and glacial period ice samples, along with the concentrations of the two other
              cosmogenic nuclides 10Be (half-life = 1.5 my) and 36Cl (half-life = 0.3 my),
              and (2) to develop coupled cosmic ray-atmospheric circulation and aerosol
              scavenging models which can adequately' predict the tropospheric fallout of
              these nuclides. The proposed work is intended to show that (i) measurements of
              26Al, which require large ice samples can be made using the available Arctic
              and Antarctic ice samples, by combining several sections, covering' tine
              periods of 500-1000 years. and that (ii) these measurements would be extremely
              valuable for understanding the nature of fallout of cosmogenic nuclides. The
              modeling effort will develop the coupled models taking into account all
              available data on the cosmic ray source function and its expected variability,
              seasonal variations in the last 30 years bused on the re-analysis global
              climatological data, and data' on the fallout of the three cosmogenic
              nuclides.
