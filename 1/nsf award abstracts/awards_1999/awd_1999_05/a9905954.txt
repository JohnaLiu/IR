Boyanovsky

This is a 24-month award proposed by Dr. Daniel
              Boyanovsky, University of Pittsburgh, collaborating with Dr. Da-Shin Lee,
              National Dong-Hwa University and Dr. K.W. Ng at the Academia Sinica. Dr.
              Boyanovsky requests travel funds for him travel to Taiwan to carry out a
              cooperative project with his counterparts at the National Doug-Hwa University
              and Academia Sinica.  They propose to use non-equilibrium and non-perturbative
              methods in quantum field theory to investigate the physics of the quark-gluon
              plasma and chiral phase transitions.  This study is jointly sponsored by the
              Taiwan National Science Council and the National Science Foundation.
