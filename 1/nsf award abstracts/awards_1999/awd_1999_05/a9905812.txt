Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, addresses the question of impurity analysis and diffusion in ice
              samples.  Professor Steven M. George and his colleagues at the University of
              Colorado apply laser resonant desorption depth profiling methods to the
              analysis of species important in heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry and ice
              core analysis.  In particular, hydrogen halides, nitric acid, various cations,
              sulfur containing molecules, and weak acids and bases implicated in atmospheric
              chemical processes are the subject of this investigation.  Using an internal
              high pressure analysis cell, coupled with a load lock system to enable the
              analysis of environmental ice samples, the location and diffusion of these
              impurities in a range of ice samples are being examined.  The results of this
              work are of significant importance to the development of accurate atmospheric
              models which include heterogeneous processes, as well as to the understanding
              of glacial ice cores and their historical record of environmental conditions.
              
 
The understanding of environmental processes such as ozone depletion and
              global warming rely on the availability of detailed measurements of the
              location and motion of trace molecules in atmospheric ice samples and in
              glacial ice cores.  The work of this research project is focussed on developing
              high spatial resolution laser desorption methods for the accurate and precise
              analysis of these sorts of environmental ice samples.  The results of this work
              are crucial to our developing understanding of the atmosphere, both in current
              times and across the geological history of the earth.
