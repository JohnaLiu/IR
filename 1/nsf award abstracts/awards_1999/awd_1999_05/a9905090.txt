This collaborative
              research project, involving scientists from the Universities of Kansas and
              Utah, and the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, applies archaeological and
              molecular genetic evidence to questions surrounding the origins of Aleutian
              Island inhabitants. Mitochondrial DNA from both skeletal remains (primarily
              stored at the Smithsonian Institution) and from living populations of eastern
              and western Aleutian Islands will be extracted, analyzed, and the results will
              be used to reconstruct the migration patterns of prehistoric peoples from
              Siberia and Alaska. The multi-disciplinary, collaborative nature of this
              research allows the comparison of genetic patterns in known ancestors and
              descendants, within an archaeological framework. The evolutionary relationships
              between prehistoric Aleutians, extant groups, and contemporary Inuits and
              Native Americans will be explored. The molecular data to be obtained in this
              project will provide a genetic characterization of the Aleutian people and
              permits testing of several hypotheses regarding the origin of the modern Aleut
              population.  During the three year duration of this project, fieldwork is
              planned for: Atka, Pribilof Islands, Anchorage, Unalaska, and Bering Island.
