Abstract    :
              This research involves development, implementation, and evaluation of a computer
              animated talking head, which generates realistic visible speech coordinated
              with auditory speech. Synthetic visible speech has an obvious potential for
              advancing knowledge about speech production, the visible information in
              face-to-face speech perception, how it is utilized by human perceivers, and how
              it can best be used in communicating with individuals with hearing loss and in
              language learning situations. Realistic speech is obtained by animating the
              appropriate facial targets for each segment of speech along with the
              appropriate coarticulation, paralinguistic content, and emotion. The research
              goal is to achieve true photo-realism (visual speech indistinguishable from a
              real talker) or even superrealism (visual speech easier to read than a real
              talker). To achieve this goal, it is necessary to obtain additional physical
              measurements from real speech, to refine the control of the talking head, and
              to evaluate these changes using intelligibility testing with human observers
              and by comparisons to natural speech.

The working hypotheses of this
              research are 1) a synthetic talker is an important challenge to speech research
              and computer animation and offers a potentially valuable medium for
              communication among both normal and disabled individuals, human-computer
              interaction, and virtual worlds, 2) synthetic visual speech will provide a
              valuable experimental tool for better understanding of speech perception by ear
              and by eye, 3) visual speech information offers an additional source of
              information for both normal and hearing-impaired individuals, and 4) the
              research will have immediate and direct application to improving the
              communication alternatives in noisy environments and for individuals with
              hearing loss.
