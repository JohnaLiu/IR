Abstract    :
                  This project is a laboratory investigation of heterogeneous processes
              related to several aspects of tropospheric chemistry.  The problems to be
              studied are:  1) heterogeneous reactions of aqueous NaCl and NaBr leading to
              the formation of photolytically labile Cl and Br compounds, 2) the mass
              accommodation coefficient of water molecules on pure water and on salt,
              sulfuric acid, and nitric acid solutions, and 3) the interactions of gas phase
              species with secondary organic aerosols.  These studies will be carried out
              using three novel techniques:  1) a droplet train apparatus, 2) a bubble train
              apparatus, and 3) an aerosol mass spectrometer/aerosol flow tube reactor. 
              These techniques make it possible to extract basic quantitative information
              necessary for modeling heterogeneous/multiphase interactions of gas phase
              species with atmospheric droplets and aerosols.
