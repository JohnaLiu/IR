Abstract    :
              The mutual influence of categorization and choice

Abstract

People form
              preferences for objects and events in the world.  The present research explores
              how people come to learn about categories of objects and events in the world
              when forming preferences about them, and how what is learned about these
              objects and events affects what people prefer.  The studies focus on the role
              of analogies in decision making about highly unfamiliar objects.  In addition,
              they examine how people's background knowledge and motivation affect choices
              and learning about new members of known categories.  This work has implications
              for many real-world situations in which people learn about the options in the
              process of forming preferences such as voting and selection of consumer
              products.
