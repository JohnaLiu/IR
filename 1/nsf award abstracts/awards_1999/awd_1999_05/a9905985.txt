Abstract    :
              
This research is a continuation of a study of the hormonal, demographic, and
              social mechanisms influencing seasonality in free-ranging sifaka (Propithecus
              verreauxi) in the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve (BMSR), Madagascar. Prevailing
              theory suggests that reproduction is tightly entrained to seasonal variations
              in photoperiod, rainfall, and food abundance in many seasonally breeding
              mammals. Reproduction in wild sifaka is highly seasonal with 96% of births
              restricted to just a two month period. However, preliminary results using
              noninvasive methods of hormone analysis indicate that male reproduction is not
              so tightly entrained, suggesting that social factors, including aggression
              during group transfer in the birth season, may be as important as climatic
              factors in the regulation of male reproductive function in this species. The
              Specific Aim of this research is to test the relationship between birth season
              testosterone (T) levels and male dispersal, age, and migration success. The
              broader implications of this research reside in the insights it may provide
              into the role of androgens (T) in mediating male dispersal, life history, and
              reproductive strategies. Hormonal, behavioral and demographic data will be
              collected from 200 marked sifaka in 37 social groups at the research site in
              Madagascar during the July-August 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 birth seasons to
              examine androgen-behavior interactions associated with T-mediated migration and
              aggression. This research breaks new ground in the study of mammalian
              reproduction by employing field endocrinological approaches to studies of male
              dispersal patterns and seasonality in free-ranging endangered sifaka. More
              importantly, this study will broaden our understanding of male reproduction and
              provide new perspectives on its complexity, variation, and evolution.
