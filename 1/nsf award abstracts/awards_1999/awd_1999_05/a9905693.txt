Abstract    :
              Schoenberg
The Rustbelt RNA Meeting is planned for November 4-5, 1999, in the
              Lodge at Deer Creek State Park in Mt. Sterling, Ohio.  The Rustbelt RNA Meeting
              (RRM) is the only major midwestern regional meeting of RNA researchers.  Last
              year the RRM was attended by principal investigators, postdoctoral fellows and
              graduate students from Ohio State University, Cleveland Clinic, Case Western
              Reserve University, the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University,
              University of Michigan, Indiana University and Purdue University.

The
              objective of the RRM is to provide an inexpensive, high caliber
              interdisciplinary regional meeting for RNA researchers in the Midwest with an
              emphasis on participation by undergraduate,  graduate, and postdoctoral
              trainees.  The meeting is open to investigators who are interested in the many
              aspects of RNA.  The meeting format is designed to foster the interaction of
              trainees at the participating institutions with each other and with the
              principal investigators.  This award will be used to help defray the expenses
              incurred by the trainees attending.
