The investigators propose to couple seismic interrogations
              of the structure of the core-mantle boundary with statistical analyses, mineral
              physics experiments (on melt/solid coexistence at ultra-high pressure), and
              simulations of rates of heat advection and conduction away from the CMB in
              order to explore the chemical, structural and thermal properties of the
              recently discovered ultra-low velocity zone (ULVZ) at the base of Earth's
              mantle.  This zone likely contains partial melt, is structurally complex and
              may be chemically distinct from the overlying mantle.  Upwellings from this
              zone also probably produce hot spots at Earth's surface. The investigators plan
              to (1) utilize broad band seismic data and waveform modeling of diffracted
              waves at the CMB to characterize the thicknesses and locations of ULVZ's; (2)
              statistically analyze available seismic observations to characterize the
              spatial variability of the ULVZ; (3) constrain likely advective and conductive
              components of heat flow across both the ULVZ and non-ULVZ-containing regions
              using fluid dynamic simulations; and (4) determine the compositions of liquidus
              phases in natural peridotitic assemblages at ultra-high pressures.
