	This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of
              a magnetic-sector inductively-coupled mass spectrometer to be installed and
              operated in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of
              Wisconsin. The University of Wisconsin is committed to providing matching funds
              for the acquisition. The instrument will be used mainly in research including
              studies of the origin and evolution of life, life in extreme environments (on
              Earth and other planetary environments), natural water chemistry and
              contamination, and basic research on the evolution and composition of the
              earth's crust and mantle. All these research applications require the special
              capabilities of the new instrument system to rapidly and precisely analyze
              nanogram quantities of isotopes and trace elements at extremely low
              concentration levels in samples of unknown compositions.
