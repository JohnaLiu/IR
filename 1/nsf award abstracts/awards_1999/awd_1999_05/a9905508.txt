Abstract    :
              The investigator will formulate and numerically solve a fully self-consistent
              set of particle and wave kinetic equations, together with an instantaneous
              dispersion equation, to describe the interactions of electron beams and
              background plasma. This process involves the excitation of Langmuir waves,
              various non-linear processes, and the eventual emission of electromagnetic
              radiation. The main effort is to extend a new, generalized, weak turbulence
              theory - developed by the principal investigator - applicable to beam-plasma
              interactions in the solar and interplanetary environment. The new approach may
              also have major consequences in the general field of plasma physics research
              and the study of microscopic turbulent plasma processes in particular. In this
              phase of the research, the investigator will concentrate on the nature of the
              generalized nonlinear dispersion equation for weakly turbulent plasmas, and
              understanding of the nonlinear eigenmode.
