	This award provides funding for the construction and
              testing of a prototype beam-balance tiltmeter to be used in seismometer
              installations to remove noise in the seismic (ground motion) signal that is due
              to the effect of tilting of the ground at the observation point. Such a device
              will improve the signal-to-noise-ratio of modern broadband seismometry. The
              instrument development and construction will be carried out in the Department
              of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Saint Louis University.
