Abstract    :
              	This project is an aggregate data collection and analysis to advance
              understanding of women's voting behavior in the 1920s and early 1930s.  Using
              Gary King's (1997) proposed solution to the problem of ecological inference,
              estimates are obtained for turnout and vote choice of women in thirteen states
              for five presidential election years (1916-1932).  City-level, ward-level and,
              for 1930, minor civil division (MCD-level) census data on gender, race,
              nativity, age, literacy, and marital status are collected.  The data are merged
              with election returns for presidential elections and any Senate, House, and
              gubernatorial elections in each presidential election year.  Models of turnout
              and vote choice are developed and refined by evaluating estimates obtained
              using King's method with true values for the State of Illinois (where votes
              were recorded by gender in several elections).  Model estimates permit new
              information to be brought to bear vis-a-vis a number of outstanding questions
              regarding the incorporation of women into the electorate:  the success or
              failure of party mobilization efforts directed toward women, the importance of
              race, age, nativity, and education, and the role of contextual factors in
              shaping women's turnout and vote choice.  More generally, this research
              clarifies the role of women's enfranchisement in declining rates of electoral
              turnout in the 1920s, and in the New Deal realignment of the late 1920s and
              early 1930s.  In addtion to the substantive questions, the project offers a
              challenging and real test for King's method of ecological inference.  Estimates
              are obtained from several levels of aggregation and from several different
              model specifications to evaluate the utility of King's method for recovering
              the observed Illinois outcomes.  Finally, census and electoral data and the
              estimated vote choice and turnout for men and women are made readily accessible
              to the broader research community interested in questions of voting behavior
              and party politics in the early part of the twentieth century.
