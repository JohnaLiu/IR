Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to investigate novel approaches to
              supporting effective and efficient access to various geographic image databases
              over the Internet leading to design of 
distributed geographic image retrieval
              systems.  The research involves three research teams from:  SUNY Buffalo,
              National Center for Science Information Systems (NACSIS) in Japan, and the
              University of Nantes in France. (IRESTE)  The technical challenges are the
              creation of a new meta-level system for geographic image databases. To achieve
              this, research issues concerned with representation models for geographic data,
              relationships between metadata and resource discovery and efficient query
              processing in a distributed environment must be addressed.   The problems
              addressed are critical to retrieval on large volume, multidimensional,
              distributed data over the Internet. Results can be broadly applied to numerous
              domain and interdisciplinary research areas.
