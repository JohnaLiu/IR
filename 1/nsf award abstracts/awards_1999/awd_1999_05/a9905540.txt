Abstract    :
              Funds that are provided will extend the use of the Lithium proxy to the arc
              systems.  The objectives are to determine the isotopic variaion of Lithium in
              lavas as a funciton of the nature of subarc mantle, the extent of modification
              by subduction components, the mass transfer processes and the physical
              conditions of the subduction environment.  In addition, sediment flux carried
              by the down-going plate will also be estimated to assess lithium recycling at
              the convergent margins.  Samples from the Cascadia, Aleutian and Tonga-Kermadec
              Arcs will be analyzed.
