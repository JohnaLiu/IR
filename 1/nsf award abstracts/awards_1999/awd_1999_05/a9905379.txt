Latitudinal diversity gradients form one of the most
              dramatic and pervasive biodiversity patterns shared by both marine and
              terrestrial systems.  However, the evolutionary dynamics underlying such
              gradients are highly controversial, in part because of the lack of empirical
              data. We propose to undertake comparative analyses of the species-level
              evolutionary dynamics that underlie marine latitudinal diversity trends using
              Eastern Pacific, Japanese, and Sakhalin Neogene molluscan faunas (0 - ca. 15
              million years ago). We will quantify species origination and extinction rates
              for latitudinally arrayed biotic provinces along each coast using Lyellian
              Percentages, "backwards survivorship curves", and stratigraphic durations of
              species. In addition, we will investigate how variations in body size and
              life-habit attributes, both within and among clades, influence evolutionary
              rates and species durations. We will use the Eastern and western Pacific faunas
              as parallel natural experiments for testing hypotheses on diversity controls
              and the organization of biotic patterns along latitude. This comparative
              approach will allow us to factor out the regional effects of geological
              history, geography and other relevant variables, and to test for the generality
              of our results.
