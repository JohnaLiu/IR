ABSTRACT

Discourse Analysis and Grammatical
              Structure in the Maya Codices

This phase of the Maya Hieroglyphic Database
              Project will complete the morpho-syntactic coding of the texts contained in the
              Maya books dating from the Postclassic Period (C.E. 1100-1520). The codices
              constitute a major part of the hieroglyphic corpus and were the source of many
              early decipherments. Unlike the texts of the monumental sculpture from the
              earlier Classic Period (250-900 C.E.), we have no direct data on the
              provenience of the extant hieroglyphic books. Also, unlike the earlier carved
              texts, the codical texts are a compilation of various sources.

The Maya
              Hieroglyphic Database allows access to the texts never before realized. It
              includes low resolution line drawings of each gly ph block with an image of the
              frame (clause with picture) within which each glyph block occurs. The database
              assembles the most current transcriptions and translations of the texts which
              will be coded for various grammatical features. The final product will include
              a CD ROM containing the Codices portion of the Maya Hieroglyphic Database, and
              a series of research papers discussing the implications of our findings. The
              detailed grammatical coding is an essential preparation for rigorous linguistic
              analysis, and will contribute to ongoing research into possible language or
              dialect differences among various sections of the codices.
