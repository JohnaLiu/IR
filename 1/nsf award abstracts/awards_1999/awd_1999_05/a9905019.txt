S. Sidhu/University of Dayton

A gas chromatograph/mass
              spectrometer/mass spectrometer (GC-MS-MS) system incorporating ion-trap
              detection is acquired and incorporated into existing flow reactor systems for
              the study of thermal reactions of hazardous wastes and hazardous materials and
              analysis of trace reaction products in complex media.
