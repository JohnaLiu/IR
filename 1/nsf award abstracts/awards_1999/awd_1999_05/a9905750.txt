Abstract    :
              Dr. Russell P. Hughes, Department of Chemistry, Dartmouth College, is  
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
              Chemistry Division to investigate processes in which a transition metal
              activates carbon-fluorine bonds. The principal objectives of the study are to
              develop the syntheses of transition-metal fluoroalkyl complexes and use these
              complexes as reagents to functionalize fluorocarbon chains. Reactions will be
              developed for the destruction of fluorocarbons to CO and HF using common
              reagents such as hydrogen and water. Another process that converts C-F to C-H
              bonds at room temperature using hydrogen gas will be investigated as route to
              the mild conversion of hydrofluorocarbons. The details of how the metal center
              is capable of activating these normally unreactive C-F bonds will be probed and
              the extent of pi-backbonding from the metal to antibonding C-F group orbitals
              will be measured.

Fluorinated organic molecules play important roles in our
              lives and the long term quality of our environment. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's)
              and perfluorocarbons (PFC's) are thought to be responsible for ozone depletion
              and global warming. Replacements for these substances are the environmentally
              friendly hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's). Thus, there is a need to devise efficient
              ways to recycle and destroy  CFC's and PFC's, and to prepare HFC's. This study
              aims toward developing transition metal centers that can make and break bonds
              between carbon and fluorine. It will permit metal catalysts to be developed
              that perform efficient and precisely controlled chemical reactions on
              fluorocarbons.
