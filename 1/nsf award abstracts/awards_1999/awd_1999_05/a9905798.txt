Abstract    :
              	This proposal requests support for a series of five political methodology
              conferences during the 1999-2003 period.  These conferences extend the mdoel
              developed with NSF support since 1986.  These conferences move in new
              directions by:  (1) opening participation to more graduate students and faculty
              was previously possible; (2) expanding the program to attract explicitly
              scholars in areas that previously have made less use of quantitative
              methodology; (3) adding a one-day introduction for graduate students that
              provides a foundation for the more advanced topics to be addressed in presented
              papers.  Each meeting consists of approximately 100 political methodologists
              drawn from both junior and senior faculty and a substantial number of advanced
              graduate students.  The conferences provide a forum for the presentation,
              discussion, and evaluation of work at the methodological frontier of political
              science.
