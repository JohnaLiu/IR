Bole is a language spoken in Yobe, Gombe, and Bauchi States
              of northeastern Nigeria by a total of about 250,000-300,000 people. It is a
              member of the Chadic Language family, and belongs to the same main sub-branch
              of that family as its massively dominant "cousin", Hausa, though linguistically
              Bole and Hausa are probably no more closely related than, say, English and
              French. Aside from Hausa, Bole is one of the largest, if not the largest Chadic
              language among the several dozen Chadic languages spoken in Nigeria. There are
              no monograph-length works of any kind on the language.

The purpose of this
              project will be to produce a comprehensive reference grammar of Bole, a
              dictionary of several thousand entries, and a collection of texts including
              ethnography, history, tales, and poetry/song. Collateral materials arising from
              the project will be a dictionary and collection of texts usable by the Bole
              people themselves and videotapes which document the Bole language, culture, and
              region. Selected features of particular typological interest in Bole are tonal
              alternations conditioned by a combination of phonological, morphological, and
              syntactic conditions; extensive processes of gemination and reduplication, some
              lexicalized, some productive; and basic SVO syntax which leaves most questioned
              and focused constituents in situ but which postposes questioned or focused
              subjects. Detailed grammatical and lexical documentation of Bole will be of
              particular interest to Chadic language specialists by filling in a gap among
              the closest linguistic relatives to Hausa.
