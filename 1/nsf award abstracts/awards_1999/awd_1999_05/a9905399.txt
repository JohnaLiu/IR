Title:
              Solar Influences on Cloud Formation and Global Temperature: An Assessment of
              the Danish Hypothesis

The proposed work will determine whether there is a
              relationship between cosmic ray flux to the earth and large-scale cloud cover
              variations. Station based cloud cover data will be used to extend the data back
              in time from the satellite era.  The hypothesis put forward by Svensmark and
              Friis-Christensen, that changes in solar irradiance modulate the cosmic ray
              flux to the atmosphere will be re-examined using this extended data set. The
              work is important because it will shed new insights on processes and physical
              mechanisms by which solar forcing affects climate on earth.
