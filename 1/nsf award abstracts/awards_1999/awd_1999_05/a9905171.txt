Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to enhance the co-translational attachment of
              N-linked oligosaccharides to polypeptides in insect cells with the goal of
              improving recombinant glycoprotein yields.  One of the major limitations of the
              baculovirus-insect cell gene expression system is its inability to properly
              glycosylate 
heterologous glycoproteins.  The investigators have hypothesized
              that during the process of N-linked oligosaccharide attachment in insect cells,
              a limitation may exist in the production of the lipid linked donor substrate,
              and/or the catalytic enzyme, oligosaccharide tranferase.  The investigators
              will determine 
which of these two factors may be the limiting step. 
              Recombinant DNA techniques will then be used to correct the limitation.  The
              investigators will also examine whether reduced N-glycan cleavage may alleviate
              the problem of under-glycosylation.
