Abstract    :
                   This grant provides support for the FutureCar Competition.  This
              competition is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the
              Department of Energy and the automotive industry in support of the Partnership
              for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) program.  It has the goal of designing
              and competing commercially producible automobiles that are simultaneously
              comfortable, safe, roadable, commercially viable, and highly fuel-efficient. 
              The goal of the PNGV program is the development of technologies that will
              enable cars that have a fuel efficiency of 80 miles per gallon.  Under the
              FutureCar Competition, a number of universities compete annually in this event.
               This award provides funding to support the competition and to offset costs for
              expenses such as team prizes, communication and safety equipment rentals and
              other competition expenses.
