Arndt
This award supports Roger Arndt from the University of
              Minnesota-Twin Cities in a collaboration with Andreas Keller of the Oskar von
              Miller Institute of the Technical University of Munich located in Obernach,
              Germany.  The project will focus on the study of the formation of periodic
              cloud cavitation in the trailing edge of hydrofoils.  Pumps, hydroturbines, and
              marine propulsors must often operate in the cavitating regime where pressure is
              low, causing bubbles to form, which can damage internal machine parts.  The
              German laboratory is one of the best equipped in the world, and will provide
              test capabilities available nowhere else.  The results of the work will be
              important in the development of higher-performance and longer-lasting hydraulic
              machinery.
