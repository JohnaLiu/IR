Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              supports research on weakly coordinating anions and cationic metal carbonyls by
              Dr. Steven H. Strauss of the Chemistry Department, Colorado State University. 
              Salts of reactive metal cations with polyfluorinated closo carborane weakly
              coordinating anions (WCAs) will be synthesized and characterized structurally,
              chemically, and spectroscopically.  These weak counterions are stable under
              harsh chemical and thermal conditions, making them interesting species for use
              in synthesis of new polyelectrolyes, solid state catalysts, and aerogels.  New
              cationic metal carbonyls with little or no pi backbonding will be synthesized,
              using WCAs as counterions.  The goal of this part of the project is to
              understand the structure, bonding and chemical reactivity of these novel
              nonclassical metal carbonyls.  Theoretical calculations will be used to help
              elucidate the experimental results.

Negatively charged species, anions, are
              needed to balance the positive charge of cations.  Here weakly coordinating
              anions are used to stabilize positive metal-containing ions while minimizing
              charge distortion.  This makes it possible to characterize metal-carbonyl
              bonding in states that are important transients in many processes important in
              industry, such as gas purification, water-gas shift catalysis, and methanol
              synthesis catalysis.
