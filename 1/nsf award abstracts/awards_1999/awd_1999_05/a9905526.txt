Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to determine the role of Reynolds number in the
              structure of the turbulent boundary layer.  Measurements of important terms in
              transport equations will be made at the Surface Layer Turbulence and
              Environmental Science (SLTEST) facility at Reynolds numbers ranging from 103 to
              106.  The SLTEST facility makes use of the atmospheric surface layer that flows
              over the Great Salt Lake Desert in western Utah.  Probes will provide spatially
              and temporally resolved measurements of the individual terms in the equations
              describing the transport of axial stress and concentration variance.  
              Measurements will also be made of the velocity-vorticity correlations.  A
              scalar transport probe, consisting of two photo-ionization sensors and four
              hot-wires, will be used to obtain data relating to the scalar variance
              transport equation. The SLTEST facility will produce low-speed, large
              length-scale boundary layers.  The importance of these facilities is that they
              allow highly resolved spatial and temporal measurements.  For the purposes of
              engineering applications such as aerodynamic vehicle drag reduction,
              fundamental understanding of transport mechanisms could be useful in design.
