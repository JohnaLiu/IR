Abstract    :
              The University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science
              (RSMAS), Center for Marine and Environmental Analyses (CMEA) is establishing a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site focused on science in support of
              management of south Florida coastal resources.  This project will develop a
              three-year program (1998-2000) of summer research experiences involving eight
              undergraduate interns per year, with emphasis on (but not restricted to)
              recruitment of students from Historially Black and Historically Minority
              Colleges and Universities (HBCUs and HMCUs).  Participants will assist research
              mentors from CMEA in laboratory and field work, as well as develop and execute
              an independent research project with the direction and guidance of their
              mentor. Participants will be involved in projects ranging from the effects of
              anthropogenic stressors on the status and health of coral reefs, seagrass
              ecosystems, and fishery resources to the integration of science and management.
                On-site field trips to management agencies will also be made to heighten the
              awareness of the type of research needed for effective management of coastal
              resources, as well as to introduce participants to non-academic career
              options.
