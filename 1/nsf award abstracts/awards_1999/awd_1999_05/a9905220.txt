Abstract    :
              This ESH project will study nitrogen isotopes and other sediment variables from
              a core in the anoxic Orca Basin to test the conclusions of a similar study in
              Cariaco Basin.  The Cariaco data have been interpreted as showing
              glacial/interglacial changes in N 2 fixation resulting from varying
              denitification rates determined by varying oxication state in the bottom
              waters.  Replication of the same record in Orca Basin would indicate that the
              variations were at least regional in scale.
