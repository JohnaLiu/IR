ABSTRACT

The Emergence of Modern English Syntax

The
              aims of this project are (1) to create an electronic corpus of 1.5
              million
words of early Modern English text and (2) to use this corpus to
              improve our
understanding of the syntactic changes that characterize the
              transition from
Middle to Modern English. The proposed corpus will contain, in
              addition to the
texts themselves, the grammatical information necessary for
              extensive
syntactic analysis. The corpus will be compatible in format with the
              existing
1.25 million word Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English
              (PPCME2) and
with the York Parsed Corpus of Old English currently under
              construction. At
the end of the project scholars will have available in
              annotated electronic
form a continuous sample of historical English from the
              earliest written texts
to 1700. Among the linguistic changes that the early
              Modern English corpus
will allow us and other scholars to address are: the
              loss of verb-second word
order, which goes to completion in the early Modern
              period; the loss of
so-called ``verb-to-INFL raising'', including the rise of
              periphrastic 'do';
and the rise of the modern English passive. In addition to
              its role in
facilitating grammatical analysis, one major effect of the English
              corpus on
future linguistic investigations will be to permit scholars to use
              statistical
methods to study empirically the temporal dynamics of syntactic
              change.
