Abstract    :
              This project is entitled "Multi-Lingual Digital Library for West African
              Sources".  It seeks to build a multi-media digital library of West African
              sources in multiple languages.  Collaborating 
organizations include several
              at Michigan State, the Institut Fondemental d'Afrique Noire (IFAN) and West
              African Research Center (WARC) in Dakar, Senegal.  Four types of material will
              be archived 
including historical manuscripts from the 19th and early 20th
              centuries (primarily in Arabic and French), oral sources (primarily in Wolof,
              Pulaar, and French), photographs and African language print 
materials.  The
              project will give careful attention to identifying and providing metadata that
              describe the provenance and content of the digital materials.  A
              multiple-languages interface will allow 
users to gain access to content
              through the use of standardized subject headings in the original languages. 
              Caching proxy server technology will be used a local site servers in Senegal to
              address 
low-speed international network connections common in African
              countries.  It is hoped that this project will serve as a model for
              larger-scale efforts by African and US researchers to create new repositories
              for  the broader research and education communities.
