Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this project is to study the involvement of the
              heterotrimeric G protein subunit, Gi(alpha2), in cellular differentiation.  The
              hematopoietic cell lines K562 and U937 will be used as experimental paradigms. 
              Differentiation will be induced in these cells with sodium butyrate and phorbol
              myristic acetate to achieve different terminal phenotypes.  The project will
              accomplish three specific objectives.  First, pertussis toxin and antisense
              methods to inactivate Gi(alpha2) will be used to test the hypothesis that
              differentiation of K562 cells (measured by hemoglobin expression) requires
              Gi(alpha2).  Second, the idea that transcriptional mechanisms are responsible
              for changes in Gi(alpha2) levels will be verified and confirmed.  Third, the
              probability that Gi(alpha2) or related G protein subunits may be translocated
              to the nucleus during differentiation will be assessed.  G protein subunits
              will be detected by immunoblotting with affinity-purified antibodies.  Nuclear
              translocation will be assayed by cell fractionation methods as well as by
              immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy.  Conventional wisdom of how G
              proteins mediate signal transduction has not traditionally considered their
              translocation to the nuclear compartment as a potential mode of action. 
              Therefore, this project has the potential of revealing novel roles for G alpha
              subunits that do not involve their traditional role in activating transmembrane
              effectors near their site of formation.  The project will also provide training
              of students of ethnic minority origin, who are historically under-represented
              in the scientific community.
