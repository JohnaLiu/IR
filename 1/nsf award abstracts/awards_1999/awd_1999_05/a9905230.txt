Preliminary data from the Galveston Bay-Trinity/Sabine
              incised valley study area indicates that two episodes of rapid shoreline
              retreat occurred during the Holocene in response to sealevel rise.  The timing
              and rate of coastal change during these periods remains problematic.  The
              questions addressed in this study are: 1) how rapid were the landward shifts in
              coastal environments and barrier shoreline submergence events? And 2) what
              length of time is required for coastal environments to reestablish equilibrium?
              To answer these questions, a transect of long sediment cores (40 m deep) up the
              Trinity valley axis will be acquired and examined for flooding surfaces that
              correspond to those observed in seismic records.  Age dates obtained near
              flooding surfaces within each core will constrain the timing of each event and
              rates of change.
