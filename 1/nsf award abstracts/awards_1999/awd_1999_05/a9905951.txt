              ABSTRACT

OCE-9905951


Researchers at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean
              Sciences propose to investigate the importance of continental shelves in the
              oceanic release of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere.  Several lines of evidence
              point to the probable importance of the shelf environment in the global
              nitrogen cycle.   Because nitrous oxide is an important greenhouse gas
              implicated in global warming and in the destruction of stratospheric ozone, and
              because continental shelves account for a significant portion of the global
              ocean area, it is now critically important to quantify the biogeochemical
              sources, sinks, and transformations in these ocean margins.   Through field
              studies on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Maine, scientists in this study
              will investigate whether nitrous oxide accumulations in subsurface waters
              during stratified conditions (summer) are significant relative to summer
              sea-air fluxes of this gas.  The importance of shelf sediments in nitrous oxide
              production will also be assessed.
