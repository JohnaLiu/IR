Abstract    :
              The PI will perform a series of experiments in a high-pressure sealed ring-shear
              device at Sandia Labs with pore pressures comparable to the decollements at
              Barbados and Nankai accretionary prisms. The experiments will explore the
              hypothesis that high strain and retained high porosity can coexist in the
              decollement zones. Analog and natural samples from Barbados and Nankai will be
              subjected to high shear strains through a variety of stress paths, pore
              pressures and strain rates.
