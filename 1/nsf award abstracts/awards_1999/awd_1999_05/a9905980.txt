Abstract    :
              This project examines long-term evolutionary and genetic changes in
populations
              of bacteria living for thousands of generations in constant
thermal
              conditions.  The PIs will determine the consequences of adaptation to
these
              constant environments, specifically, the increase in relative fitness
and
              efficiency of growth.  The PIs will also examine whether these changes
              are
accompanied by loss of function in other thermal environments, that
              is,
whether the range of temperatures over which the bacteria can grow
              and
reproduce declines and whether they become less fit and less efficient
              in
other thermal environments than that in which they are cultured.  The PIs
              will
make these measurements on two sets of bacterial lineages, one that
              has
been cultured at 37 C for 20,000 generations and another that will
              be
cultured at 37 C for 2,000 generations, after having adapted to
              other
thermal environments.  The results of these studies will provide
              important
experimental tests of predictions for the responses of biological
              systems
to global climate change and for general evolutionary theory
              concerning
environmental adaptation.
