Abstract    :
              This award funds a two day workshop on Internet Service Qualities to provide a
              unique opportunity for academics, researcher, business leaders and policymakers
              to present and discuss their research plans and results and gain a better
              understanding of the rapidly changing environment for Internet integrated
              services.  The workshop's goals are to develop a framework for understanding
              the technology and economics of Internet integrated and differentiated services
              and to provide constructive feed back to industry and government of issues that
              are important for sustainable Internet growth.  Expected topics include 1) the
              economics of Internet interconnect, multicasting and applications, 2) technical
              and experimental models for delivering multiple qualities of service, and 3)
              regulation and standards in the emerging networked environment.
