This research is aimed at providing a connection
              between the subjects of membrane protein structure, folding and oligomerization
              on the one hand, and lipid bilayer properties on the other.  The approach is to
              measure helix-helix association-dissociation equilibria in lipid bilayers and
              in membranes, observing changes in the dissociation constant resulting from
              changes in the lipid environment.  General effects, such as those arising from
              bilayer thickness and cholesterol content, and specific lipid association
              effects, in which dilute quantities of a lipid in a bilayer have
              disproportionate effects on the helix dissociation will be investigated.  Two
              key assays are Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and a new genetic assay for
              helix association.  These will allow studies in synthetic lipid bilayer
              vesicles and in the inner membrane of living E. coli, respectively.

These
              studies are relevant to such important areas as transmembrane signaling events
              (which often involve changes in helical membrane association), selective
              transport in membrane trafficking (where evidence suggests bilayer thickness
              effects to segregate retained and transported proteins in cytoplasmic
              compartments), and modulation of many membrane functions. A fundamental
              understanding of the principles of membrane protein folding should also prove
              enlightening in attempts to interpret
information in genomic databases.
