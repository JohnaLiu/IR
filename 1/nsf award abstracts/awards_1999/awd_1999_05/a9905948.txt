The objectives of this research include new
              experimental
measurements and computational simulations of helicon
plasma
              sources (n_e=10^11 - 10^13/cm^3) which are
important for a  variety of future
              applications.  These
include submicron plasma etching of wafers, 
              processing
of  materials, an efficient  ionization source for argon
lasers, a
              large volume source for simulation of space-plasma
experiments, a source for
              fusion plasma confinement
experiments, a processor of nuclear waste, and as
              a
thrustor for space vehicles.  Key issues which have not
been resolved to
              date  for these sources are: 1) Mechanisms
for producing fast ionizing
              electrons (in argon E > 16 eV)
and measurements of their energy distribution
              function in
space and time, which are key  to efficient ionization in
              helicon
sources, 2) Mechanisms for rapid spatial  damping of the wave
in
              inhomogeneous magnetic field configurations and  realization
of new antennas
              which improve source operation, 3) 2-D
simulations of wave antenna coupling,
              linear heating, and
nonlinear wave trapping processes, which can be
              compared
with experimental observations and utilized to predict
              future
helicon source properties which is new to the field.  We
              have
developed a new experimental facility which will utilize as
diagnostics
              a fast response optical probe,  spectroscopy
of energetic argon states
              indicative of fast electrons, wave
field, frequency spectral analysis,
              Langmuir probe and
diamagnetic loops and  network analyzer techniques
              to
measure the matched antenna impedance.  We will develop 
a 2-D plasma
              profile, finite-difference, full electromagnetic code 
(MAXEB) which will be
              compared with experimental observations.  
The improved understanding of the
              physics of plasma production 
and simulation techniques for these sources will
              provide a basis for 
greatly improved antenna and magnetic field source design
              
and larger size plasma sources for a variety of applications.  
The close
              coupling of our new experimental program with simulation 
programs provides an
              exceptional opportunity for improving our 
knowledge for future applications
              in this emerging technology area.
