Process field studies to document the energy
              transfer from basin scale modes to 
high frequency waves to turbulent motions
              leading to boundary mixing will be 
studied in Mono Lake. Four tasks that are
              essential for understanding these 
energy pathways will be pursued: 1) a
              determination of the variability of  basin-
scale motions using field
              observations and numerical modeling; 2) a 
documentation of the strength,
              spectral distribution and temporal variability of the 
high frequency internal
              wave field; 3) measurements of turbulent mixing and its 
efficiency near the
              boundary; and 4) observations of the redistribution of mixed 
fluid and
              resuspended sediment from the boundary.
