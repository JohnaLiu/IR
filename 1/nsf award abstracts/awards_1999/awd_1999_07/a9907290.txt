Abstract    :
              The PI will continue her work on the geological provenance of ice-rafted
              detritus (IRD) in the North Atlantic during the last glaciation in order to
              infer which ice fields underwent accelerated calving leading to deposition of
              Heinrich layers as records of fresh-water injection in the ocean.  These have
              implications for abrupt climate change.  The study will involve Ar40/Ar39 
              analyses of individual grains of IRD from three cores in the North Atlantic. 
              This multi-isotopic and petrological work could produce important results
              related to ocean-climate-ice sheet interactions in the late Quatenary and
              regional dynamics of the Laurentide ice sheet.
