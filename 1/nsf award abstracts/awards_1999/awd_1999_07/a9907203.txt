This award is to support planning, organizing, travel and
              attendance at the MPATHE-2000 (Mechanics of Plants, Animals and Their
              Environments) to be held at Il Ciocco, Italy, in 2000. The conference will
              bring together biologists, engineers, and physical scientists (chemists,
              physicists, and mathematicians) to focus attention on the specific subject of 
              Sensors and Sensing in the Natural and Fabricated World. Special emphasis will
              be placed on combining biological, physical-chemical and engineering
              fundamentals to understand the nature and performance of natural sensors, and
              through this understanding possibly guide the conceptualization, design,
              fabrication, and range of applicability of fabricated sensors.
