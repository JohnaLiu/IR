Abstract    :
              This award is a supplement to the funding for the Engineering Research Center on
              Power Electronics Systems at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
              University for the purpose of supporting collaboration with Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology.  The purpose of the effort is to address the need for
              low-cost power electronic systems at both the power converter level as well as 
              integration of the converter into the final accessory system.  These systems
              will be suitable for mass production for use in power systems in the automotive
              industry.  The objective of the effort is to develop powere lectronics
              packaging processes that are tailored for large-scale, high-yield,
              manufacturing.  This involves designs that eliminate the need for conventional
              wire-bond device attachments.  The design will have convenient integration of
              passive power components into the packaging plus thermal, mechanical and
              elcetrical considerations.  The power converter and the motor-based automotive
              accessory will be integrated into a single seamless package.
