A
              Study of Quadruped Gallops by Simulation and Experimentation

This is the
              first year funding of a three year continuing award. The
proposed project
              includes simulation, design, construction and testing
of a legged robot in
              gallop gaits. The project will test theoretical
models of the mechanics and
              control of galloping developed by the
authors and others. The project will
              break new ground by being the
first attempt to operate an artificial machine
              in a true gallop. Other
new departures will be numerical and experimental
              investigation of
strategies for rapid starts and stops, and for sudden changes
              in
direction. A gallop is more complex than the symmetric gaits used
              in
previous running quadrupedal robot studies because it is a
              single-foot
gait with the feet touching down individually, and because it
              is
obviously asymmetric. The asymmetry results from the
              non-linear
interaction of the ballistic trajectories of the body between
              footfalls
and the pitch and roll movements of the body resulting from
              off-axis
foot thrusts. Control and stabilization of galloping will
              be
extensively studied in numerical simulation before implementation
              in
hardware. The same approach of simulation followed by experimental
testing
              will be used to study strategies for rapid starts, stops and
changes of
              direction.
