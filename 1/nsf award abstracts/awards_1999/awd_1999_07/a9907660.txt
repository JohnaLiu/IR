Abstract    :
              	This is a collaborative project with Dr. Waugh of Johns Hopkins University
              (ATM-9970507).  The principal investigators (PIs) will examine the kinematic
              transport of tracers across the tropopause in order to better understand the
              coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere.  A key component of the
              study will be the development and testing of a numerical scheme, the so-called
              "surface advection" technique.  This technique is a direct extension of
              "contour advection", a trajectory-following technique which has been used
              successfully by the PIs and others in examining the fine scale structure of
              atmospheric transport on quasi-horizontal surfaces.  The new scheme will allow
              for the visualization and quantification of whole surfaces as they evolve in
              three-dimensional space.  Using this new technique, the PIs will study
              tropopause folds with the goal of estimating the transport between the
              stratosphere and troposphere during these events.
