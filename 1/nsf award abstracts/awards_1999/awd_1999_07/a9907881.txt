Abstract    :
              The rapid growth of e-commerce on the Internet has raised a question of whether
              the Internet will mainly facilitate market consolidation by large companies, or
              whether it will be a driver of growth for small and medium-sized enterprises
              (SMEs) as well.  This is significant because e-commerce could lead to increased
              competition, greater consumer choice and more innovation, or it could lead to
              reduced competition, consumer choice and innovation, depending on the impacts
              of e-commerce on firm and industry organization.  The early evidence on the
              question is mixed and largely anecdotal. Therefore, the objective of this
              research to provide scientific evidence on the question.  It uses theory on
              firm and industry organization as the conceptual basis for hypothesizing that
              e-commerce will lead to greater use of market transactions, as opposed to
              internal hierarchies, to organize economic activities, leading to increased
              competition and new business opportunities. This project examines the
              hypothesis through systematic, detailed case studies of the extended value
              chains of four firms in the PC industry.  The computer industry is chosen
              because it is the leading user of e-commerce and it includes manufacturing,
              service, and information sectors, thus providing a microcosm of the national
              economy. The results will not only contribute new knowledge, but also provide a
              scientific basis for public discussion about the social and economic impacts of
              e-commerce, and lead to a more extended empirical study.
