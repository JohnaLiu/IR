The National Research Council's (NRC) Center for Science,
              Mathematics, and Engineering Education (CSMEE), at the behest of the National
              Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), is conducting a review of the NCTM's
              revised standards document, "Principles and Standards for School Mathematics
              (PSSM)."  The NRC review process is used to determine that NCTM has adequately
              responded to the comments on the PSSM received from diverse groups during the
              comment period.  The NRC report improves the dissemination and credibility of
              the PSSM.
