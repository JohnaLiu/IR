The 1999 International Conference on Solid-State Sensors and
              Actuators represents an	
important opportunity to participate in discussion of
              the current state of the art in microstructure
fabrication and the development
              of MicroElectroMechanical Systems. The 10th International
Conference on
              Solid-State Sensors and Actuators (Transducers '99) will be held in Sendai,
              Japan,
from June 7 to 10, 1999, sponsored by the Institute of Electrical
              Engineers of Japan.

Transducers is a biennial conference focusing on theory,
              design, fabrication, and
application of solid-state sensors, actuators, and
              microsystems. It is an interdisciplinary gathering 
with participants from
              university, government, and industrial laboratories representing a diverse
              
cross spectrum of fields: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering,
              materials science biomedical engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, and
              microelectronics.
