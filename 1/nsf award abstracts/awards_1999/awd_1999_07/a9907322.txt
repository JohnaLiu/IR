This research project is directed toward
              providing answers to fundamental questions concerning heat production and
              transport when microwave energy is used to promote chemical reactions on
              supported metal catalysts.  These materials consist of nanometer-sized metallic
              particles distributed within a porous ceramic substrate.  Microwave fields do
              not couple to the ceramic support at temperatures of interests in chemical
              reactions, but they may couple strongly to the metallic particles because of
              electron quantum confinement.  This phenomenon offers the opportunity to
              selectively heat the catalyst particles to temperatures higher than the matrix.
               Selective heating can result in greater control over chemical reactions and
              possibly high selectivity for desirable products.  Increased selectivity in
              microwave-enhanced chemical catalysis has been reported, but the causes are
              unclear.  Because of the difficulty of measuring temperatures of
              nanometer-sized particles, no direct verification of selective heating has yet
              been achieved.  This project will employ theoretical modeling and a novel
              experimental technique based on neutron absorption to determine whether
              catalyst particles are susceptible to selective heating by microwaves. 
              Temperature measurement of nanometer-sized particles cannot be done by
              conventional techniques.  Neutron resonance radiography will be used to resolve
              the temperatures of catalyst particle and support.  The success of this method
              could open a new avenue for developing catalytic reactions.
