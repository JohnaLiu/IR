Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to provide in situ verification of hydrometeor
              classification schemes developed for remote sensing via multiparameter radar. 
              The emphasis will be on a classification scheme developed mainly from "fuzzy
              logic" analysis of model particle characteristics observable in polarimetric
              radar data, that operates in real time on the NCAR S-Pole radar.  Aircraft
              equipped for microphysics and supporting observations will provide the in-situ
              data for verification of this (and other applicable) classifiers.  Optical
              scattering and imaging probes on the aircraft provide data on the hydrometeors
              for comparison with the inferences from concurrent polarimetric radar data. 
              Other data characterizing the environment are useful in dealing with cloud
              physics questions such as the possibility of wet growth of graupel in a given
              region of supercooled cloud.  Data to be collected during the Mesoscale Alpine
              Program (MAP) in 1999 and in the Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and
              Precipitation Study (STEPS) project in 2000, will provide the basis for
              validation of the radar hydrometeor classification scheme.  The S-Pole radar
              will provide the polarimetric data in each case; for MAP the aircraft data will
              come from the NCAR Electra and the NOAA P-3, while the South Dakota School of
              Mines and Technology T-28 will provide the aircraft data in STEPS.  The end
              result will be a more complete understanding of the capabilities and
              limitations of the hydrometeor classification scheme for a wide range of cloud
              and thunderstorm environments.
