Title:
              Health, Climate and Infectious Disease: A Global Perspective

This is an
              award to the American Academy of Microbiology (AAM) to convene a colloquium,
              entitled 'Health, Climate and Infectious Disease: A Global Perspective'. A
              multidisciplinary panel of distinguished scientists working on climate
              variability, infectious disease and health will come together to accomplish a
              better understanding of how climatic factors affect the spread of infectious
              disease. This is critical to improve disease prevention efforts because such
              knowledge would enhance the ability to predict the health-related effects of
              both seasonal weather changes and large-scale disturbances such as El Nino. The
              AAM will develop a report and disseminate the in-depth analysis of the issues
              and recommendations for future plan of action, to the scientific community, to
              federal and international agencies, to policy makers, to the press and to the
              public. The work is important because it will enhance bridges between several
              disciplines, and serve as an example of an end-to-end application of the basic
              research undertaken in Climate Dynamics.
