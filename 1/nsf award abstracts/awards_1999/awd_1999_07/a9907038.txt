Abstract    :
              Using two Time Series - Submersible Incubation Devices (TS-SID), researchers are
              conducting autonomous high temporal resolution measurement of carbon-14 primary
              production on the Bermuda Testbd Mooring.  These measurements seek (1) ground
              truthing of bio-optical models used by BTM investigators for estimating primary
              production from mooring bio-optical measurements, and (2) a head to head
              comparison with ship based Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) primary
              production measurements for confirming long term accuracy of TS-SID function,
              and providing direct quantification of phytoplankton response to short term
              perturbation.  The TS-SID constitutes the highest resolution long term
              measurement of carbon-14 primary production made in this region, and can
              address issues of temporal aliasing and how well short term events (such as the
              spring bloom) are represented by the lower frequency study.  Resulting data
              will intercalibrate a composite term encompassing maximum quantum yield and
              spectrally weighted phytoplankton absorption coefficient - variable necessary
              to translate bio-optically measured incident light and chlorophyll biomass into
              estimates of production.
