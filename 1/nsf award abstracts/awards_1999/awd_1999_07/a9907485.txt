Abstract    :
              The most apparent architectural trends in high-performance computing in the
              recent years is the emergence of cluster or network of workstations (NOW)
              architectures, where a set of off-the-shelf high-performance desktop machines
              connected by a high-speed system-area interconnect can efficiently execute
              parallel programs and sometimes out-perform custom-built multiprocessors or
              multicomputers that axe orders of magnitude more expensive. The key driving
              force behind cluster computing is the unstoppable advances in microprocessor
              performance, which in turn is enabled by the economies of scale in the PC
              industry. We are witnessing a similar technological revolution in 3D graphics
              hardware arena. The performance of low-cost 3D graphics cards is improving at
              an astonishing rate of 80% per year within the last five years, and if
              continuing at this rate, is expected to out-pace high-end graphics engines such
              as those from Sili-con Graphics in 2003. Despite these incredible performance
              progresses, most of these graphics cards remain relatively inexpensive. The
              central research questions that this project aims to answer are whether it is
              feasible to build parallel 3D graphics engines that are based on the clustering
              architecture and 3D graphics cards and whose overall performance can scale with
              the number of CPUs/graphics processors, and if so, what the enabling
              algorithmic and architectural techniques axe. The project will address these
              questions by designing, implementing, and evaluating efficient software for a
              cluster-based parallel 3D graphics system called Sunder, which is built on top
              of Linux and Mesa.
