              ABSTRACT

OCE-9907024


The isotope 129I is a cosmic ray produced species
              with a decay half-life of 15.7 million years. If its distribution is well
              known, it could be applied to various geologic and paleoceanographic studies.
              This work will determine the 129I/I ratio and I concentrations in sixteen
              samples from four ODP cores in order to establish the history of  I-129
              deposition in marine sediments of the open ocean over the period of the last 25
              million years.  The cores are representative of different paleoceangraphic and
              sedimentological conditions from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The work will
              incorporate micropaleontological and stable isotope studies in order to put the
              I-129 results into the appropriate time scale.  By measuring the 129I/I ratio
              in independently age-dated cores, the time history of  129I deposition will be
              reconstructed.
