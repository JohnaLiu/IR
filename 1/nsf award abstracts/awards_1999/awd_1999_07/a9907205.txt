Recommended project is for a high-resolution,
              3-D marine seismic survey of a 9 x 4 km area on the crest of Hydrate Ridge, on
              the Cascadia accretionary complex of the offshore Oregon continental margin. 
              The survey will use ocean bottom seismometers (OBS's) to optimize recording of
              the seismic signals, and will focus on mapping the presence of gas hydrate
              within the accretionary sediments in this region of high fluid flux.  Other
              goals center on defining the gas hydrate stability conditions; estimation of
              gas hydrate and free gas volumes, with the free gas trapped beneath bottom
              simulating reflectors (BSR's) associated with gas hydrate presence; defining
              pathways of fluid flux and their importance in gas hydrate formation; and slope
              stability (or instability) related to gas hydrate presence on the Cascadia
              margin.  Specific hypotheses to be tested by the research include: 1) do bright
              stratigraphic reflections represent developing zones of focused fluid flow; 2)
              does a double BSR imaged in previous multichannel work within an anticline in
              the study region represent destabilization of hydrate in response to folding;
              3) can tomographic inversion of refracted arrivals image the sub-BSR volume in
              which free gas is present; and 4) does the presence of hydrate and free gas
              affect the mechanical properties and thus slope stability and morphology of
              accretionary complexes.  This work will provide the 3-dimensional stratigraphic
              and structural context for the proposed Ocean Drilling Program drilling (ODP
              proposal 546-Full) on Hydrate Ridge, which is designed to "ground truth" the
              factors related to gas hydrate formation and stability.
