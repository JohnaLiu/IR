Abstract    :
              The ethnic conflict that occurs in many contemporary multi-ethnic societies is
              often claimed to be associated with strong ethnic identification. However,
              studies that link ethnic identification to ethnic conflict tend to treat the
              former as a simple attribute, equally present for all members of an ethnic
              group. This approach is questionable, for it ignores social and individual
              variation and fails to address sufficiently the conditions under which ethnic
              identities are engendered. Consequently, we have only a superficial account of
              the link between identity and conflict. This doctoral dissertation research
              will address these deficiencies by examining the conditions under which ethnic
              identities become salient and the role two key social attributes, class and
              gender, play in this process. Relevant data for assessing these issues will be
              collected in a survey on ethnic identity in Mauritius, a strategic site for
              examining these phenomena. Results from the study should provide a better
              understanding of the conditions under which strong ethnic identification occurs
              and its potential for ethnic conflict.
