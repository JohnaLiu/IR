Abstract    :
              This project will further develop the WINDMI model of the magnetospheric tail
              and its interaction with the ionosphere.  The technique used is the reduction
              of the system to a dynamical model with a small number of dynamical parameters.
               This reduction to a low dimensional order makes it possible to model and
              predict the behavior of the system without resorting to extremely complex
              numerical simulations such as MHD simulations and kinetic particle simulations.
               This model is of particular applicability to the growth, triggering and
              recovery of magnetospheric substorms.
