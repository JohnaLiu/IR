Abstract    :
              Partial travel support for selected speakers at the workshop on "Multicomponent
              and Multiphase Fluid Dynamics" to be held at the University of Pennsylvania,
              Philadelphia, on March 12-13, 1999, has been requested.  This workshop is
              dedicated in honor of Prof. D.D. Joseph of University of Minnesota on the
              occasion of his 70th birthday. The focus of the conference will be on emerging
              research in the areas of multicomponent and multiphase flows, with strong
              international participation.  Over 60 invited papers are planned to be
              presented from U.S., France, Italy, Brazil, Venezuela and other countries. The
              workshop covers a variety of subjects, from theoretical, numerical and
              experimental areas to applications to chemical and oil processing.  The
              Workshop will promote industry-university interactions and educational
              activities in the field.  Several presentations will discuss future trends.  A
              summary report of the workshop will be published in the International Journal
              of Multiphase Flow.
