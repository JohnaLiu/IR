The workshop represents continuation of a larger planning
              process within the Division of Ocean Sciences, which is attempting to define
              significant future research directions for ocean science and NSF support. As
              part of this Divisional activity, a  workshop on future Marine Geology and
              Geophysics research was held in late 1996 to identify critical research
              questions in the next millennium. That workshop recommended a series of smaller
              meetings to be focused on infrastructure needs and requirements with which to
              address the identified research priorities. This award requests support to hold
              a workshop on marine seismic reflection needs for the U.S. marine geoscience
              community, a critically important capability in understanding the geology of
              the seafloor.

Primary objectives of the workshop are: (1) to identify the
              seismic reflection requirements of future programs, (2) to identify the
              technologies that will be required to meet these requirements, (3) to identify
              required improvements in data quality, archiving and access, and (4) to examine
              methods of support and infrastructure maintenance. Publication of the workshop
              proceedings and initial recommendations will be initially web based to allow
              additional community input. A hard copy publication is planned after
              assimilation of this community reaction.
