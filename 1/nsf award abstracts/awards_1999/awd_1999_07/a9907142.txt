Time and Space-Efficient Template Based Indexing

This is the
              first year funding of a three year continuing award. Under this award, the PI
              will develop an approach to image-based object recognition which directly
              addresses
the fundamental challenges posed by the object recognition problem:
              sensitivity to changes in pose and illumination, computational complexity with
              respect to the number and complexity of the models, and potentially prohibitive
              storage requirement for representing the models.The approach is based on
              computing the responses of
appropriate filters in images of the model objects
              and of the observed scenes. The research conducted under this grant involves
              the mathematical modeling
of filters that have desirable properties with
              respect to changes in pose and illumination. Amongst the possible classes of
              filter, the class of steerable filters is used
as a starting point for this
              analysis, owing to their properties with respect to groups of image
              transformations. These properties are exploited to develop an efficient
              indexing
scheme for recognition. The main contribution of this research is an
              efficient and robust approach to matching and indexing which may be used
              directly for recognition, and also may be used in conjunction with other
              recognition techniques, such as feature-based techniques. In addition, the
              research will contribute to a computational theory of steerable filters which
              will convert the mathematical properties of the filters to algorithms relevant
              to a broad range of recognition, image matching, and image analysis
              problems.
