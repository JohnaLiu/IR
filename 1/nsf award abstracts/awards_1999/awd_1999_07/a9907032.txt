This is a U.S.-Polish workshop on inducible
              transcription factors in the brain.   The US co-organizer is Dr. Keith
              Pennypacker of the University of South Florida and the Polish co-organizer is
              Dr. Leszek Kaczmarek of the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of the
              Polish Academy of Sciences.   Recent research has indicated that a handful of
              transcription factors may exert dramatic influence on brain physiology and
              pathology.  An understanding of this influence and dissecting it into specific
              components is the major challenge at present as it should lead to advancing our
              knowledge of signal transduction in the brain.  This workshop will bring
              together a group of specialists from various countries to present their recent
              results and to discuss their implication for approaching this challenging
              scientific question.

This neuroscience workshop fulfills the program
              objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to
              combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
              benefit.
