Abstract    :
              This program will lead to a comprehensive review of available geological data
              from cross-sectional views of the uppermost oceanic crust fromed at fast to
              intermediate spreading mid-ocean ridges.  New data will be acquired from the
              Macquarie Island ophiolite.
