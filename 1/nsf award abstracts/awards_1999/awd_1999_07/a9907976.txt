This Americas Program award will fund a US-Bolivia research
              project on the environmental impacts of mining in Bolivia.  Collaborators are
              Dr. Jerry R. Miller, Indiana University, Bloomington and Ing. Jorge Tejerina
              Oller,  Universidad Autonoma
"Juan Misael Saracho", Tarija, Bolivia.  The
              primary objective of this project is to increase our understanding of the
              transport and fate of heavy metals within river systems in general, but
              particularly within the Pilcomayo-Pilaya system of Bolivia.   Specific
              objectives are to determine the role of geomorphic processes, and the changes
              in these processes on the primary depositional patterns of heavy metals, to
              gain a preliminary understanding of the phase-specific distribution of selected
              metals within the deposits and to determine the relative importance of historic
              and modern mining operation on sediment and water quality within the Rio
              Pilcamayo valley.  With this information, the researchers will develop a
              conceptual/empirical model to describe  the transport and storage of
              sediment-bound heavy metals along the river.  The results of the investigation
              will provide an initial step in understanding the environmental impacts
              associated with heavy metal contamination from mining operations,  which could 
              be used by several organizations to develop sound management and restoration
              strategies.
