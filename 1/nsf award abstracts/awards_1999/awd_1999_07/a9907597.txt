Abstract    :
              


Although it has long been known that the plant hormone auxin plays a role
              in virtually all aspects of plant growth and development, it is only recently
              that biologists have had the tools available to address questions regarding the
              specifics of these processes.  The application of new technologies and vastly
              improved analytical methods are leading to dramatic advances in understanding
              of auxin transport, auxin biosynthesis, auxin metabolism, and auxin mode of
              action.  The first international workshop devoted entirely to the subject of
              auxin biology will include sessions on auxin and genomics, auxin and embryonic
              pattern, auxin and vegetative pattern, auxin and flower/fruit development, and
              auxin and cell division.  Researchers from around the world will meet to
              discuss recent research progress as well as to plan new collaborations that
              exploit all of these new tools.  NSF support of this conference will provide
              funds to help defray travel costs for junior scientists and for some of the
              invited US speakers.
