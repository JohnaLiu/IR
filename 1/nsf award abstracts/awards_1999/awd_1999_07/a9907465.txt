This proposal requests funds to support the International
              Symposium on Advanced Luminescent Materials and Quantum Confinement to be held
              as a part of the 196th Meeting of the Electrochem-ical Society in Honolulu,
              Hawaii (October 17-22, 1999). More specifically, the funds requested ($6,000)
              are for partial support of the travel expenses of graduate students wanting to
              attend the meeting. The money would be for fourteen travel grants ($400 each).
              An additional $400 will be used as a price for the best paper presentation by
              one graduate student. The $400 grant would help the students to cover the
              registration fees ($65 for members of the Electrochemical society and $75 for
              non-members) but also defray costs of other expenses (airplane ticket, hotel,
              meals, and short course registration).

This symposium will address recent
              developments in the area of nanoscale semiconductor, metal-lic, and organic
              structures. Emphasis will be placed on quantum effects and single electron
              storage in small scale Silicon and III-V compound Structures and devices. It
              will also cover fundamental issues in luminescence physics and chemistry of new
              classes of phosphor and porous materials in-cluding both atomic and molecular
              structures. Papers are solicited that cover fundamental aspects of science and
              engineering of quantum confinement in nanostructures, as well as related
              technology and applications.

Areas of particular interest include: (1)
              Clusters and Other Nanostructures, (2) Chemistry of Nanostructures, (3) Novel
              Fabrication Techniques for Nanostructures, (4) Electron Transport in
              Nanostructures, (5) Cooperative Phenomena in Nanoclusters, (6) New Device
              Concepts, (7) Layered Magnetic Structures and Giant Magnetoresistance, (8)
              Quantum Architectures and Circuits, (9) Optical Properties (wells, wires, and
              dots), (10) Organic, phosphor, and porous materials, (11) Spectroscopy of
              luminescent materials (photo-,cathodo-,electro-, radio-luminescence, and
              coherent luminescence), (12) Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors.

A short
              course on "Simulation of Nanoscale Materials and Devices" will be offered at
              the ECS meeting as part of the symposium.
