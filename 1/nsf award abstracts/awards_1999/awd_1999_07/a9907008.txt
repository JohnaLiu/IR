This project will finish the initial development of an
              ocean general 
circulation model based on layers defined by orthobaric density
              
surfaces (an empirically pressure-corrected density), and apply the 
model
              to the North and tropical Pacific.  The work will focus on the 
formation and
              evolution of N. Pacific Intermediate Water, the 
influence of mean
              stratification on the propagation of planetary 
waves, and a comparison
              between orthobaric density, potential density 
and neutral density.
