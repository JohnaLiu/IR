One of the most popular strategies to overcome the negative
              effects of habitat fragmentation is to link otherwise isolated patches with
              corridors. However, the assumption that corridors facilitate plant and animal
              movement and increase their population sizes, a central tenet of conservation
              biology, has been virtually untested. These investigators will conduct large
              scale experiments of corridor effects on plants and animals, and determine the
              efficacy of corridors as conservation tools in human dominated landscapes. The
              study will occur in cooperation with the US Forest Service at the Savannah
              River Ecology Laboratory in South Carolina. The study has three primary
              objectives: 1) to test the hypothesis that corridors increase movement between
              connected patches, 2) to test the hypothesis that corridors increase plant and
              animal abundances in connected patches, and 3) to test the hypothesis that
              corridors increase species abundances in less isolated patches on the scale of
              forest management activities in this region. Using data from the field
              experiments, the PIs will parameterize GIS-based simulation models to determine
              the value of corridors in human dominated landscapes. The combined results of
              these studies in experimental and managed landscapes will generate the most
              far-reaching, definitive test of corridor effects on plant and animal
              populations, and their relevance to conservation in fragmented landscapes.
