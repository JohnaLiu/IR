Abstract    :
              The researchers will continue to provide the US component to the International
              Tundra EXperiment (ITEX).  ITEX uses a very simple experiment throughout the
              Arctic to examine the potential effects of global warming on Arctic tundra. 
              Small open-topped plexiglass cones are placed on the tundra to cause a 2-4
              degree warming similar to that predicted for atmospheric temperatures in
              response to a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from increased
              emission of greenhouse gases.  Botanical variables are measured within and
              outside the cones to determine effects caused by the induced warming.  The
              relationship of the changes in the tundra produced by the manipulative heating
              experiment are used to predict future change occurring in response to global
              warming.  The US research component of conducts a research program at Toolik
              Lake, Atqasuk, and Barrow Alaska and at one site in Canada in conjunction with
              Canadian researchers.  The results of the ITEX Project are very important for
              reliable forecasts of the response of Arctic tundra to global warming.  Those
              forecasts are critical to understanding the role of the Arctic in the global
              carbon cycle and the sustainability of natural resources in response to global
              change.
