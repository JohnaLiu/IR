Abstract    :
              As part of the CASES-99 program (Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange
              Study-1999), the PI will measure the temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind
              velocity with high resolution in time and altitude using instruments suspended
              from a tethered kite or, in calm conditions, a tethered blimp.  The purpose of
              CASES is to study the physics and dynamics of the very stable nocturnal
              boundary using an array of surface-based instruments, remote sensing
              observations, a 60-m instrumented tower, and two instrumented airplanes. 
              Observations by the kite/blimp system will provide vertical profiles up to
              about 2 km, supplementing the aircraft measurements and filling the important
              altitude gap between the top of the tower and the minimum aircraft altitude. 
              It will also provide time series of temperature and wind velocity at selected
              altitudes to permit the observation of transient events such as intermittent
              bursts of turbulence, strong gusts, and wave motions.  Phenomena of special
              interest are low-level jets, wave instabilities, and the turbulent mixing of
              air across the nocturnal inversion.  These measurements, in combination with
              simultaneous observations by the instrumented tower, the aircraft, and the
              remote sensing equipment (radars, lidars, wind profilers) will constitute an
              excellent set of data for studying the dynamics of the stable boundary layer
              throughout its entire vertical extent.
