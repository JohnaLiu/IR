Abstract    :
              Many real-world problems such as robot motion planning, scheduling, frequency
              assignment in wireless networks, and network resource allocation can be
              represented as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) that are based on 
              constraint networks.  These types of problems are usually distributed, dynamic,
              and contain large numbers variables and constraints.  The development of
              adaptive algorithms that are capable of solving large-scale, distributed,
              dynamic problems is a necessity.   In this proposal, the PI describes a
              research program that investigates the use of hybrid genetic algorithms (HGAs)
              for evolving solutions to recurrent, dynamic CSPs (RDCSP).   A RDCSP can be
              viewed as a CSP where the constraints, variables, and values of variables are
              temporarily added or removed. RDCSPs can be based on either centralized or
              distributed constraint networks.  This research will lead to a greater
              understanding of the types of RDCSPs that are most challenging for HGAs and
              hill-climbing algorithms, and will result in the development of an HGA that
              searches more efficiently than the hill-climbing
