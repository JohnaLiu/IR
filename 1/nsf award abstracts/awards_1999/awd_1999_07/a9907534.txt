Abstract    :
              Climate warming may have serious impacts on permafrost and the soil active
              layer.  This three-year study will investigate factors affecting the average
              permafrost conditions as well as its spatial variability.  Theoretical
              procedures for separating deterministic and stochastic components of the
              spatial variability of active layer thickness will be developed. These models
              will be linked to climate predictions produced from global climate models in
              order to predict the regional conditions of the soil and permafrost.  These
              model results will then be validated using data collected at 69 sites included
              in the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) network and at 120 Russian
              stations, as well as new data from 10 selected Russian sites.  Thus, maps will
              be developed which give the mean parameters describing the active layer
              thickness and also its variability on local to regional scales.
