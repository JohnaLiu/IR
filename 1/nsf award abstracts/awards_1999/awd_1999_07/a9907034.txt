"The Scientific Defense of
              Segregation, 1954-1967"

This Postdoctoral Fellowship supports research on a
              group of scientists who, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, argued that
              segregation was justified because science had proven that African Americans
              were biologically inferior to white Americans. These scientists testified as
              expert witnesses in Federal Court trials that attempted to overturn Brown v.
              Board of Education. Segregationist scientists argued that the scientific
              consensus on the equality of the races was a vast conspiracy to silence what
              they claimed was the objective truth about racial differences. The research
              joins several ongoing debates in the history of science literature on the
              nature of "biological determinism." The research will be carried out in an
              extensive array of published and archival sources.

This fellowship also
              includes a training component wherein the grantee is working with social
              psychologists, behavioral geneticists and other scholars of the scientific
              study of ethnicity and race. This training will enhance the grantee's
              understanding of the methodological and technical issues involved in the
              scientific study of ethnicity and race.

The fellowship is being held at the
              University of Colorado's Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race in the
              Americas in Boulder, Colorado.
