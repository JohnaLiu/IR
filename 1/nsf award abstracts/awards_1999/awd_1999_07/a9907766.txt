This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on the past, present and future of photosynthesis and
              photoconversion to be held in Okazaki, Japan for one week in November l999. 
              The co-organizers are Professor Kirk Schanze of the University of Florida and
              Professor Suehiro Iwata of the Okazaki National Research Institute in Japan. 
              The theme of the seminar is broadly centered on the topic of photosynthesis and
              energy conversion (artificial photosynthesis).  The seminar will focus on
              significant advances that have been made in these areas during the previous two
              decades as well as topics of current interest in the field.  The topics
              include:  1) semiconductor photoelectrochemistry, dye-sensitization of
              semiconductor colloids and application of photocatalysis to environmental
              remediation;  2) fundamental and applied topics in molecular and supramolecular
              photochemistry related to photoconversion including ultrafast spectroscopy,
              molecular charge transfer, photoresponsive materials and photoconversion in
              chemical systems;  3) structure and function of photosynthetic reaction
              centers, synthetic model systems for the photosynthetic reaction center,
              artificial photosynthesis; and  4) molecular regulation of photosynthesis and
              genetic engineering of photosynthetic efficiency. 

The areas of physics,
              chemistry and biology being discussed are relevant to many current global
              problems.  These include the need for development of energy efficient economies
              and alternative (i.e., non-fossil fuel) energy sources, global warming and
              advanced agricultural technology.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese
              experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work,
              and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers
              have made a special effort to involve younger scientists.  The proceedings of
              the meeting are expected to be made available by the organizers on a specially
              constructed web-site that will be announced in appropriate newsletters (e.g.,
              "The Inter-American Photochemical Society Newsletter," "The Spectrum," and
              "Japan Photochemical Society Newsletter").  They will further establish links
              to the site at established chemistry and photoscience related web sites.
