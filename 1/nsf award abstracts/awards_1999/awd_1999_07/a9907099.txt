The Kodiak Tribal Council, a non-profit Alaska Native
              organization, will hold a workshop in Kodiak City on genealogy and kinship in
              the Alutiiq culture area.  The workshop will bring together Alutiiq community
              leaders and elders and Alaskan social scientists.  Seven Kodiak Alutiiq
              communities will participate: Akhiok, Old Harbor, Karluk, Larsen Bay, Port
              Lions, Ouzinkie, and Kodiak City.  The workshop is designed to build
              collaborations between ethnographers, ethnohistorians, and Alutiiq communities.
               Another important goal is to incorporate kinship research into public
              education; to do this, staff members from the Kodiak Alutiiq Museum and the
              Kodiak Island Borough School District will participate.
