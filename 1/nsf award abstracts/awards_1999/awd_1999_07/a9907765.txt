Abstract    :
              	This project is a field study of fluxes of atmospheric aerosol to grass using
              micrometeorological techniques and high frequency aerosol measurements. 
              Aerosol size spectra consisting of optical measurements of particle
              concentration from a high flow rate sensor and wind velocity data from sonic
              anemometry will be collected from field towers for determining turbulent fluxes
              using eddy correlation.  Fluxes estimates will also be derived from vertical
              profiles of aerosol concentration.  Uncertainties associated with aerosol
              counting statistics and the effect of hygroscopic growth on aerosol fluxes will
              be investigated.  The primary goal of this project is the determination of the
              aerosol deposition velocity (flux/concentration) as a function of diameter,
              friction velocity, and stability.  These flux measurements will help determine
              the key physical and chemical process controlling the fate of aerosols, and aid
              in the parameterization of aerosol removal in regional and global models.
