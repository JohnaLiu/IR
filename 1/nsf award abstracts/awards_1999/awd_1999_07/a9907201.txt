Abstract    :
              Funds are being provided for the deployment of 14 benthic flux meters that will
              be combined with ocean-bottom seismometers (OBSs), and 8 autonomous flux
              meters, across the Costa Rica subduction zone. The meters will provide
              information about the regional changes in diffuse fluid expulsion patterns
              across this convergent margin. The study will be carried out in conjunction
              with another funded study across the Costa Rica subduction system that will
              deploy the OBSs. The flux meters are designed to measure slow to moderate flow
              rates and will provide broad regional coverage. In the Costa Rica system most
              of the fluid expulsion is expected to be slow to moderate diffuse flow. Knowing
              these flux rates is relevant to the objectives of the MARGINS' experiments on
              the Subduction Factory (SubFac) and SEIZE topics.
