This is an investigation of a
              new ion source for implantation and synthesis of materials from solid targets. 
              In this new technique, ablation plasma ion implantation (APII), energy-beam
              ablation of solid targets (metals, ceramics, or semiconductors) is used to
              generate pulses of ions for implantation, ion-assisted deposition, or synthesis
              of compounds.  This study aims at development of a knowledge base on APII and
              the definition of scaling laws that can be used to evaluate engineering
              applications.  The primary ablation source used is a KrF excimer laser
              operating at 50 Hz; other ablation sources available for comparison include
              e-beam, XeCl laser and YAG laser.  Laser and optical diagnostics are applied to
              characterize the ablation plume species, the densities and energies of
              electrons , atoms, and ions, and the behavior of the sheath.
