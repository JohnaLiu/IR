The Role of Learning in Perceptual Organization of Complex
              Images

This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award.
              
Perceptual organization is the ability to efficiently group
              low-level
primitives, such as pixels or edge segments or regions, so as to
              form
object hypotheses with minimal domain knowledge. This process is
              an
essential link between the noisy low-level segmentation processes and
the
              sophisticated, computationally expensive, object recognition
processes. This
              work will address three major scientific issues
related to perceptual
              organization in computer vision: (i) How to
efficiently form large groups of
              extended low-level primitives by
assembling small groups of features
              (grouplets)? The concept of graph
spectra is an ideal mechanism for this
              purpose.  (ii) How to encode
the dependency of grouping parameters on image
              statistics?  Joint
probability distributions encoded as Bayesian networks
              offer an
efficient abstraction. (iii) What is the role of learning
              in
perceptual organization? The specific roles of learning explored would
be
              threefold: (a) learning the image to grouping parameter mapping,
(b) learning
              the forms of the groups, and the associated hierarchy,
from object models, and
              (c) learning the primitive type, such as
corners, textured-regions, or edges,
              that is appropriate for a domain.
