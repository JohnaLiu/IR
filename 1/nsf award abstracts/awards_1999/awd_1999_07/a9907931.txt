Abstract    :
              Mesoscale iron fertilization experiments are somewhat controversial,
              prohibitively expensive, logistically difficult to perform in many open ocean
              environments and not suitable for fine scale ecological ocean studies.  In situ
              diagnostic indicators of iron limitation can circumvent the above stated
              problems.  The investigators will collaborate with trace metal chemists and
              biologists to explore the applicability of utilizing in situ biochemical and
              biophysical indicators to assess their usefulness and validity.  In so doing,
              the scientists will also participate in investigating the hypothesis that the
              Peru coastal upwelling system is iron-limited.  The two in situ indicators that
              will be investigated include (1) photochemical efficiency measurements using a
              fast repetition rate fluorometer and (2) quantitative measurements (using a
              combined high performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis
              method) of ferredoxin and flavodoxin concentrations in algae as an indicator of
              iron-nutritional status.  These two methods will provide complimentary evidence
              regarding algal iron-limitation in the macro-nutrient replete Peru upwelling
              region.  In addition, taxon-specific growth rates of algae will be measured
              using 14C pigment labeling to help interpret and support measurements by other
              investigators of the ambient iron concentration as well as the results from
              iron-addition experiments that will be run concomitantly on a transect across
              the Peru upwelling region.
