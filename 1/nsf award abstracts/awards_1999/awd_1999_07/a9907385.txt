Abstract    :
              The project is focused on coping with "ignorance" in interactions among
              electronic agents -- when information is unavailable, uncertain or incorrect --
              intentionally or otherwise.  Constraint computation technology is used to model
              three important electronic community interactions: competition, cooperation,
              and consultation, and to manipulate information so as to cope with ignorance
              among elements of the community.  Such coping skills are required for
              interaction in electronic communities under fully realistic conditions. For
              example, negotiating agents may need to deal with their ignorance of each
              other's priorities.  For privacy or proprietary reasons, 
agents may wish to
              reveal as little as possible about their priorities. The development of
              different strategies that provide the best balance of privacy and openness for
              different needs is a key research issue. The following specific questions are
              addressed: 
  - How can agents compromise to work together despite differing
              desires, which they may not wish to reveal? 
  - How can agents cooperate to
              overcome individual limitations when they do not wish to allow unrestricted
              access to each other?
  - How can unarticulated requirements be elicited from
              people or other agents in an effective and unobtrusive manner?
