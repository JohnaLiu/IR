Abstract    :
              This award is for Parallel CFD '99, the eleventh in an international series of
              meetings featuring computational fluid dynamics research on parallel computers,
              will be held May 23-26, 1999 in Williamsburg, Virginia.  

The technical
              program features invited speakers, three tracks of contributed presentations, a
              poster session, and will be preceded for the convenience of conferees by an
              optional half-day tutorial introducing the PETSc parallel software system,
              including case studies from fluid dynamics.  Early experiences on
              teraflops-class ASCI computers and a report on the ASCI alliance program will
              also be featured at the meeting.
