This  dissertation enhancement grant will support
              Michael Kenney, under the direction of Dr. Philip Williams, University of
              Florida, for a study of the Colombian government's anti-drug policies and the
              drug trafficking enterprises (DTE'S)  targeted by these efforts.  The study
              will be based on three hypotheses that explain the failure of the Colombian
              government to reduce the cocaine and heroin production:  the government lack of
              the necessary amount of anti-drug resources, the government drug -related
              corruption, and the capacity of the drug traffickers to undermine government
              anti-drug efforts.  Data will be gathered from semi-structured interviews with
              experts on the drug trade, including US and Colombian government officials,
              anti-drug analysts, criminal lawyers involved in narcotics cases, and
              journalists.  

The research has the potential to make a significant
              contribution to our understanding of the Colombian DTE's and organized crime.
              It could also have important implications for US and Colombian counter-narcotic
              policies, and provide insight to other countries where governments are
              struggling to cope with transnational criminal enterprises.
