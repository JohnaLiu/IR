The purpose of the proposed research is to explore the
              potential for mixing analog VLSI-based front-ends with DSP-based back-ends for
              processing auditory signals. Based on the conclusions and progress of this
              research, it is expected that we will be able to determine future paths of
              research, especially directed toward commercialization of products that
              incorporate analog VLSI-based pre-processing onto existing auditory processing
              systems. It is certainly possible that conclusions of this research might
              suggest a degree of futility in combining analog VLSI with DSP for these
              applications. Even in this worst case sce-nario, however, we expect that
              valuable insight into the potential of analog-VLSI circuits for auditory and
              other non-visual processing applications will be gained from the
              research.

The exploratory research we propose is divided
              into:

Understanding and applying a particular DSP Architecture (Analog
              Devices 2100 series) to simple auditory processing problems
Improving the
              design and implementation of compact, highly tunable bandpass filters in analog
              VLSI to suit the strengths of the DSP.
Combining the DSP and improved analog
              VLSI front-end to process simple auditory signals
Comparing the performance of
              analog VLSI, DSP, and mixed signal systems in processing these same auditory
              signals in terms of power, space, anticipated cost, and recognition accuracy.
