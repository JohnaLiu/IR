Abstract    :
              
This project will support a major expansion of the research and educational
              facilities at the University of New Mexico's Sevilleta Field Research Station
              in central New Mexico, USA, in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy (TNC)
              and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).  The FWS is constructing a new
              building near the field station, that will house the FWS and field station
              administrative offices, a new public visitor center, a research/education
              laboratory, and a conference/workshop facility with kitchen.  The project will
              provide support primarily  for equipping the laboratory and conference
              facilities, and for providing two vehicles for field work and education on the
              Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge.  The new facilities will relieve the heavy
              pressure of users on the existing field station in both research and conference
              activities by expanding available research space by 40% and doubling the
              existing conference/workshop space, and will greatly enhance the public
              outreach programs for environmental education of the general public and K-12
              schoolchildren.  This tripartite between UNM, TNC, and FWS will continue to
              foster the common policy goals of all three organizations in promoting research
              and public education in this unique region of New Mexico.
