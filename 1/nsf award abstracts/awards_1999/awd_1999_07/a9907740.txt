Abstract    :
              Improvements to the experimental pond facility at the Kellogg Biological Station
              will enhance research opportunities for visiting and resident scientists and
              students.  Nine of the 18 experimental ponds at the pond facility will be
              renovated by removing nutrient-rich sediments and old plastic liners, and
              replacing them with new  20 mil PVC liners covered by a nutrient-poor sand/clay
              substrate.  Currently, these nine ponds are eutrophic and macrophyte choked,
              and are unsuitable for most experimental studies (the other nine ponds were
              successfully renovated in 1987).  The pond renovations would allow the pond
              facility to operate with 18 fully-functional ponds to meet the increasing
              demands of visiting and resident researchers.

Renovations to the existing
              laboratory at the pond site, the construction of a new seasonal-use building,
              the installation of a new well for the pond laboratory and mesocosm array, and
              the installation of a computer connection to the KBS network, will facilitate
              research and teaching at the pond site and at nearby lakes, streams, and
              wetlands.  These improvements are designed to accommodate increased use of the
              experimental pond facility by visiting scientists working on a variety of
              aquatic systems.
