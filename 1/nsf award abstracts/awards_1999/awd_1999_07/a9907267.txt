Abstract    :
              This proposal represents a continuation of our effort to understand two-phase
              flow in seafloor hydrothermal systems (more generally termed NaCl-H2O systems).
              With recent NSF support, we have developed a numerical code for modeling
              two-phase flow in a NaCl-H2O hydrothermal system called GTHSW (Georgia Tech
              Hydrothermal Seawater). We are also in the process of fully documenting the
              code so that the research community can use it. In the proposed research we
              will extend the code to 1000 degrees C by using corresponding states theory to
              calculate enthalpy for the NaCl-H2O system and improve code efficiency by
              modifying it for parallel computations. We will then perform fundamental and
              parametric modeling of NaCl-H2O systems using fundamental one and two
              dimensional model geometries. We will then use the code to model the Salton Sea
              Geothermal System, California, investigate the formation and dissipation of
              brine layers at the base of bottom heated seafloor systems and  study the
              evolution of vent chlorinity in dike-heated) systems.
