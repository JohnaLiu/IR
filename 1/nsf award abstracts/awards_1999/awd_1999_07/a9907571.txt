Proposal:
              9907571

Ca2 + channels located in the cell plasma membrane control a large
              number of cell activities. In nerve and endocrine cells, opening of these
              channels signals the release of neurotransmitters or hormones. CA2+ channels
              are inhibited by a number of plasma membrane receptors. The dopamine D2
              receptor found in a number of nerves and endocrine cells can very rapidly
              inhibit neuromodulator release by blocking Ca2+ channels. This proposal has two
              goals: first to develop an imaging-based method for measuring certain rapid
              aspects of Ca2+ channel kinetics, then to use the method to study dopamine D2
              receptor regulation of voltage activated Ca2+ channels.
A specially designed
              microscope will be used to capture the fluorescent light from probes placed in
              living cells which will show us the dynamic changes in the Ca2+ levels of
              living cells, as they happen. This real-time, imaging-based method would
              measure Ca2+ channel activity indirectly as changes in intracellular Ca2+
              levels. Up to now, this type of experiment has been done by patch clamp
              methodology. Our approach would not be a replacement for patch clamp methods,
              but rather be used as a complement to, and for some studies, a viable
              alternative to whole cell patch clamp.
The same pharmacological tools as used
              by patch camp experimenters will be used to establish that plasma membrane
              channels were the sources for changes seen, and not release from intracellular
              stores.   Which of several sub-types of channels are inhibited by the receptor
              will be identified. Finally the time, in milliseconds, required for the D2
              receptors to inhibit Ca2+ channels will be measured.
The method offers several
              advantages for events which have half-times longer than 50 msec, although it is
              as expensive as that for whole cell patch clamp, and presently cannot measure
              10 - 20 msec events. Its use for Ca2+ kinetics is only one of many. Only the
              fluorescent probes available limit the possibilities. New probes are marketed
              daily.
