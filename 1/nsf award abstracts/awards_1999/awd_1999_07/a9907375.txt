This is a three year dissertation enhancement project
              proposed by Ms. Julia Klein and her adviser, Dr. John Harte, University of
              California at Berkeley.  Ms. Julia Klein requests funds for salary for herself
              and one undergraduate student assistant, travel and per diem, and sampling and
              laboratory costs to carry out her Ph.D. dissertation research.  This proposal
              plans to study ecosystem feedback to climate warming and pastoral land use
              change on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China.  The goal of this study is to
              improve our understanding of future global environmental changes and their
              effects on the biosphere.  This project is jointly supported by the Chinese
              Academy of Science and the National Science Foundation.
