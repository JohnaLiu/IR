A confluence in scientific advancements associated with
              molecular biology and nanofabrication technology now offer, for the first time,
              the potential of engineering functional hybrid organic/inorganic nanomechanical
              systems. The F1 -ATPase biomolecular motor is capable of generating a force
              >100 pN, has a calculated no-load rotational velocity of 17 r.p.s., and a
              diameter of less than 12 nm. These characteristics are consistent with the
              engineering features associated with current nanomechanical structures. Thus,
              the objective of this proposal is to produce a nanomechanical device that is
              powered by the biomolecular motor, F1-ATPase. It is anticipated that this
              effort will result in a device that will demonstrate the technology for
              creating a new class of hybrid organic/inorganic devices.
