Abstract    :
              Global climate changes, from natural and human-induced forces may have an impact
              on how animals behave. The PIs will investigate the effects of one agent
              associated with atmospheric global change, ultraviolet-B radiation, on
              amphibian behavior.  It is known that the eggs and developing embryos of some
              species are damaged by ambient levels of UV-B radiation that may be increasing
              due to ozone depletion.  The objectives of this research address how UV-B
              radiation may affect key behaviors that, if altered, may have significant life
              history consequences.  Thus, behaviors associated with avoiding UV-B along with
              UV-B affects on mating, egg-laying, aggregation, activity, and predator-prey
              behavior will be studied.  The PIs will use both laboratory and field
              experiments to manipulate UV-B exposure and then obserbe consequent changes in
              behavior.  Few experimental studies have attempted to investigate how specific
              environmental stresses, such as UV-B affect the behavior of an animal.  The
              research will provide basic biological information on how animals may respond
              to sub-lethal exposures of UV-B
