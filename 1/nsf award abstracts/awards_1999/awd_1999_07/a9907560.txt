Abstract    :
              Since 1991, the University of Maine has made significant financial investments
              in its marine laboratory, the Darling Marine Center to equally benefit both
              University personnel and visiting colleges and reserarchers.  During 1997-99
              alone, the University supported improvements including a student
              dormitory/dining hall.  New flowing seawater facilities (construction to begin
              spring 2000), a new 42' coastal research vessel (under construction), and more
              classroom microscopes and computers (delivered and in use) have also been
              supported.  All of these improvements directly benefit visitors and they
              reflect a stated policy of encouraging increased use of the facilities by
              visiting investigators and outside colleges.  Extensive marketing and
              word-of-mouth testimonials by visitors have resulted in a dramatic increase in
              visitor use of the facilities.  While the Center strongly encourages visiting
              scientists and colleges to make use of its facilities, the growing popularity
              of visitor programs has resulted in a serious shortage of lab and classroom
              space.  Educational and research opportunities for visitors are being
              restricted by a lack of adequate teaching and research space.

The increasing
              demand for lab and classroom space exceeds current capacity and the facility is
              now unable to accommodate all potential visitors during some periods of the
              year.  Based on several years of experience serving visitor needs, it has been
              learned that it is most efficient to provide flexible, multi-user space that
              can serve both educational and research needs.  Therefore, the University will
              construct a 1290sq. ft.  Visiting Investigator/Classroom addition to a new
              Marine Culture Laboratory scheduled to be built in spring 2000.  This facility
              will create more space for visiting scientists, it will allow out-of-state
              colleges to bring more students to the center, and it will make it possible for
              more than one visiting college to conduct courses simultaneously.
