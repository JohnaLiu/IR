This award provides funding for a one-year
              Research Opportunity Award (ROA) to the University of Central Florida to work
              on a joint research project with the Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center on Corrosion in Multiphase Technology at Ohio University.  The
              interdisciplinary research program will examine the surface chemistry,
              structure and morphology of c-steel coupons in multiphase oil/gas lines with
              and without inhibitors.  The ability to analyze the corrosion chemistry of the
              coupons is of vital importance in the successful operation of the multiphase
              lines with little or less damage in the petroleum industry.
