Abstract    :
              This project supports a joint U.S.-Korea Workshop on New Frontiers in
              Infrastructural and Seismic Engineering.  The funding for the support is
              provided jointly by the Hazard Reduction Cluster of the CMS Division and the
              U.S.-Japan Korea Program of the International Division.  Korea and the U.S.
              have a long-standing record of joint frontier research through bilateral
              symposia/workshops.  Objectives of this workshop are: 1) to assess the current
              state of theory and practice in seismic and infrastructural engineering and to
              foster communication across a diverse engineering disciplines representing
              theoretical and experimental research as well as design, for a broad range of
              applications; 2) to stimulate future cooperative research and development in
              subjects of common interest and importance; 3) to evaluate the results of
              Korea's civil infrastructure research program and their practical application
              to U.S. engineering practice, particularly in mitigating natural hazards; and
              4) to continue to build the long-term bilateral scientific relationship
              existing between the academic and practicing professional communities. 
              Proceedings of the workshop including presentations, highlights of group
              discussion, and workshop resolutions will be published in book form and
              distributed to the participants as well as individuals and institutions with an
              interest in this area.
