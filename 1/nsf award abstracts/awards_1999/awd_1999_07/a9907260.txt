This is a planning grant whose purpose is to complete the
              planning of a major Local Systemic Change initiative for elementary school
              science in rural areas of Missouri and Iowa and would include 20-30 small
              school districts.  Planning activities will include a demonstration of the use
              of a fiber optic network for professional development and a three-day meeting
              devoted to planning for curricula implementation, professional development and
              teacher support for all possible school districts.  The meeting will involve
              teachers, administrators, parents, and community members from the prospective
              districts.  Before the meeting takes place, districts that have not yet used
              any of the reform-based curricula will be asked to pilot test at least one such
              program.  Following the summer planning meeting, the project staff, working
              with representatives from the interested school districts, will complete the
              design of a comprehensive reform initiative.
