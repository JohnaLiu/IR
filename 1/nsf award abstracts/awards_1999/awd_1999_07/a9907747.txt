Abstract    :
              
This proposal describes a program aimed at the realization of large
              second-order nonlinear optical coefficients in polymer thin films that exhibit
              high thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability. It can be achieved by
              controlling the molecular orientation of active chromphores into
              noncentrosymmetric assemblies at nanoscale levels.  Specifically, the approach
              is to design and fabricate the organic thin films by using unique self assembly
              of multilayers in which alternative subnanometer thick layers of oppositely
              charged anions and cations are built by alternately dipping a solid substrate
              into solutions of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes.  In preliminary studies
              the group has grown films consisting of 100 such bilayers. These films are
              robust, and no degradation of the second order nonlinearity was observed over
              two years under ambient temperature and more than 18 hours at 150oC.  However,
              further investigation showed that the net orientation of the chromophores was
              only 2%.  The aim of this proposed research is to improve the degree of
              orientation by using the novel molecular self-assembly concept and by using
              surface angle and optical measurements to determine the degree of orientation.
