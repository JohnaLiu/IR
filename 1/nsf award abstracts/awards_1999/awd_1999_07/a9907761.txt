Abstract    :
              Stratus and stratocumulus clouds regularly form and dissipate in many coastal
              regions of the world.  These clouds are not only an important element of
              regional weather, they also influence regional and global climate through their
              effect on solar radiation.  The goal of this project is to improve the ability
              to forecast low-level clouds in coastal regions.  The objectives are to
              determine the importance of mesoscale circulations and the microphysical
              properties of the clouds on cloud behavior.  The approach is based on
              observations with the instrumented Twin Otter aircraft operated by the Center
              for Interdisciplinary Remote Piloted Aircraft Study (CIRPAS) and ground-based
              equipment including a wind profiler/RASS system, a laser ceilometer, and a
              millimeter-wavelength radar.  Separate projects funded by the Office of Naval
              Research cover the cost of the airplane time, the radar analysis, and the
              installation on the airplane of new equipment for cloud physics research.  Dr.
              Wang will collaborate closely with Dr. Bruce Albrecht of the University of
              Miami and researchers from CIRPAS and Cal Tech to insure that the experiments
              of the different groups are effectively coordinated.  The research should lead
              to a more complete understanding of the evolution of stratiform clouds in
              coastal regions and better ways of incorporating these clouds in numerical
              forecasting models.
