The project will (a) implement a system for delivering data
              from environmental sensors within an instrumented forest to classroom computers
              immediately after the data are collected (i.e. in near "real-time"), and (b)
              demonstrate that the "real-time-ness" of the data makes it possible to
              accomplish educational objectives that could not be accomplished with archived
              data.  The instrumented forest is the Black Rock Forest (BRF) in the Hudson
              Highlands region of New York.  Two terrestrial sensor stations and one stream
              sensor station automatically monitor and record environmental parameters such
              as air, water, and soil temperature, solar radiation, precipitation, relative
              humidity and stream discharge.  The project will bring these environmental data
              into a professionally managed digital data library, onto the World Wide Web,
              into an easy-to-use data visualization tool, onto student computers, and into
              student imaginations-all within a few hours after it is collected.  In
              addition, the project will develop and test an exemplary undergraduate
              investigation, which will showcase the value of real-time data for education,
              and exercise the real-time data link under realistic conditions.  Students will
              examine archival precipitation and stream discharge data, develop a model
              linking the two, and then use their model to predict what the stream discharge
              will be a few days into the future.  Most adult geoscientists have spent most
              of the questions that society is posing to the geoscience community have to do
              with the future.  We need to find ways to train our students to think
              rigorously but boldly about the future.  Predictive investigations are one way
              to do this.
