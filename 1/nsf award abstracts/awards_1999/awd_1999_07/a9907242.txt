This proposal requests support for a number of electrical
              engineering students (with a major in power engineering) across the United
              States to attend the 31st annual North American Power Symposium (NAPS) to be
              held on October 11-12, l999 at Cal Poly State University,  San Luis Obispo,
              California.  Symposium expenses could be a deterrent for graduate students
              planning to attend the conference.

NAPS  is an annual conference, sponsored
              by the Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and a selected
              university on the North American Continent.  At this conference, university
              professors and students are encouraged to present the results of their research
              among colleagus at an early stage in their work.

NAPS participants are from
              the electrical engineering departments of major universities in the country
              with research interests in different areas of power engineering, some from the
              university abroad, and some from industry.  NAPS authors are required to attend
              the conference and present their papers.
