This award provides partial funding support for a workshop
              entitled "Mineralogy at the Millennium."  The workshop will provide an overview
              of the most exciting results of research in the broadly defined field of
              mineralogy and the opportunities for the most promising areas of research in
              the future.  The workshop is to be held at the headquarters building of the
              Carnegie Institution of Washington which will host the meeting of international
              researchers in the field of mineralogy.
