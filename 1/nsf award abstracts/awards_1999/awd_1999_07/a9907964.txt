Abstract    :
              The American Association of Engineering Societies will continue and enhance its
              leadership position in promoting sustainable development in the global
              engineering community, especially through its role as the US member of the
              World Federation of Engineering Societies (WFEO).

In this, its goals are:
 
                        - to advance the state of the art in sustainable development by
              providing engineers in the United States and beyond with effective tools for
              application in preserving and protecting the global environment.
            -
              promulgate sustainable development philosophy and methodologies throughout the
              engineering community.
            - contribute to the strength and activities
              of the WFEO Standing Committee on Transfer, Sharing, and Assessment of
              Technology (ComTech).
