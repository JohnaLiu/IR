Abstract    :
              Reward expectations theory explains how individuals' socially relevant
              characteristics can determine their expectations for rewards in collective task
              groups. The theory also predicts a reverse process, whereby the distribution of
              rewards within a group can determine members' status positions in that group.
              Evidence for the process has come from tests that used money, or points
              exchangeable for money, as rewards. However, the reward expectation theory is
              general: It predicts that distributing nonexchangeable goal objects, such as
              honors or titles, should also lead to status hierarchies. This status-valued
              process is important in recent theories addressing the creation of status
              characteristics. This project will employ an adaptation of a standardized
              experimental procedure using non-exchangeable rewards to provide the first
              direct test of reverse process predictions. The proposed work will serve as a
              first step in developing a research program that addresses how various
              characteristics become status valued.
