Abstract    :
              The South Sandwich Trench is the southern most trench on Earth and receives cold
              Antarctic Bottom Water.  The inhabitants of this trench and that of the Weddell
              Sea thereby live in the coldest deepest (high pressure) habitats on Earth. 
              Yayanos will test the hypothesis that the bacterial inhabitants of these deep
              sears are the most pressue-limited organisms on Earth.  Prior results show
              conclusively that inhabitants of cold deep-sea environments have the greatest
              pressure sensitivities among known bacteria of the deep sea.  These Earth
              inhabitants may be best suited for comparison with possible inhabitants on
              Europa's ocean.  Yayanos and his colleagues will also study the bacterial
              inhabitants of the Kermadec-Tonga Trench.  Tonga Trench is more stenotopic with
              respect to temperature and pressure than are the bacteria of the Marianas
              Trench that they have previously studied.  This physiological change is
              believed to be caused by the slightly lower temperature whose influence is
              exaggerated in high pressure habitats.
