Abstract    :
              Geological and geophysical observations indicate that serpentinites (rocks from
              the earth's mantle that are metamorphosed under hydrous conditions near the
              earth's surface) are an important component of the oceanic lithosphere at
              slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges. The primary goal of this project is to provide
              experimental data on the rheological properties of serpentinites and to provide
              constraints on the conditions at which serpentinization of mantle peridotite
              initiates.  In particular we propose to: (1) Conduct experiments on
              non-serpentinized peridotites to investigate the process of thermal cracking. 
              These experiments are designed to investigate mechanisms by which fluids can
              penetrate into the lithosphere to promote serpentinization; (2) determine the
              range of conditions over which the unique style of brittle deformation
              exhibited by serpentinites occurs and how it influences the permeability of
              deforming aggregates; and (3) investigate the effect of temperature on the
              strength, deformation mechanisms and permeability of serpentinites and
              serpentine-bearing fault gouge.  The results of these studies will provide
              fundamental constraints necessary for understanding the depth to which fluids
              can penetrate the cooling lithosphere and how the strength of the lithosphere
              evolves during serpentinization.  In addition, experimental constraints on the
              permeability and rheology of serpentinites under hydrothermal conditions will
              help quantify the potential weakness of serpentinized faults and therefore the
              extent to which strain localization in the mid-ocean ridge environment is
              influenced by serpentinization.
