The topical areas to be
              covered in this workshop: flow fields that are relevant to the environment and
              to aircraft and the approaches: basic fluid dynamics, applied mathematics and
              dynamical systems theory, are quite relevant to several of the research program
              at the National Science Foundation (Fluid Dynamics and Hydraulic, Applied
              Mathematics, Oceanography and Atmospheric Sciences) as well as other government
              agencies.  The planned workshop is expected to provide both valuable
              presentations and to engender useful discussions thereof.  Their reporting in
              the planned volume will add to the timely literature in these areas.
