Abstract    :
              Methods are described for using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model system for
              genetic analysis of mechanisms that control lifespan and behavior during adult
              life. In the fly, as in humans, there is a scenario of up and down regulation
              of various genes as life progresses. The project describes methods for
              identifying the genes involved and measuring their activities. Three special
              groups of mutants to be used for the analysis are 1)short-life mutants, 2)
              mutants that are sluggish in their locomotor activity during life, and 3)
              mutants that have extended lifetimes. In some cases, the mutants have been
              found to have late-onset neurodegeneration and characterization of those
              phenotypes will continue. Identification and cloning of the genes affected in
              such mutants and monitoring their activities during life, can provide keys to
              the underlying events. An investigation into the genetics of pain will also be
              initiated.

Genetic analysis of Drosophila development has had dramatic
              success in analyzing early events in embryogenesis and postembryonic events in
              the larva and pupa. However, many studies end at the point of emergence of the
              adult, which, with the exception of gametogenesis, is generally regarded as
              postmitotic and finalized, with the nervous system hard-wired. But the newly
              emerged adult fly continues to undergo important developmental and behavioral
              changes and the nervous system retains plasticity, as demonstrated by the fly's
              ability to learn. This proposal uses genetic analysis to address such on-going
              events in the adult.
