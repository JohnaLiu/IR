Abstract    :
              The development of planning models and algorithmic techniques for optimizing the
              supply chains of chemical process industries will be performed.  The goal is to
              provide tractable models and solution techniques for multisite deterministic
              and stochastic planning problems of realistic size and industrial relevance.  A
              hierarchical decomposition procedure is proposed based on Lagrangean
              relaxation.  The basic concept is to partition the original problem into
              smaller, more tractable subproblems through the hierarchical relaxation of key
              complicating constraints.  The systematic identification of these constraints
              is accomplished by utilizing dual multiplier information.  Preliminary results
              of this framework suggest significant reduction in computation time.  The
              stochastic work will focus on utilizing the deterministic equivalent concepts
              for providing a computationally tractable description of uncertainty in
              multisite planning problems.  Normally distributed uncertainty on product
              demands, prices, and production rates will be explored.  Emphasis will be
              placed on answering questions regarding inventory level management, safety
              stocks, and capacity utilization in the face of uncertainty.  The concept of
              linking the computational study on the deterministic model to the solution of
              the stochastic problem could have significant impact in industrial planning.
