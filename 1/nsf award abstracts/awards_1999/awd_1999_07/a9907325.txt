Abstract    :
              Information systems (IS) sourcing is an intricate phenomenon involving a
              multitude of actors, tasks, technology elements, service levels, reporting 
              relationships, etc., in an environment of information asymmetry, incomplete
              contracts, and goal incongruency. This research develops a multi-theoretic
              contingency model of IS sourcing for effective governance of a firm's IS
              infrastructure in such a complex environment. The preliminary contingency model
              is based on economic and organizational theories of agency, transaction costs,
              incomplete contracts, resource dependence, etc.  Qualitative secondary data and
              a focus group are initially used to refine the preliminary contingency model.
              The refined model is then empirically validated in the context of a specific
              industry using a two-shot longitudinal survey and quantitative content analysis
              of industry-specific secondary data. Results of this research will provide IS
              managers with a framework for designing appropriate sourcing configurations to
              achieve firm-specific sourcing objectives under different environmental
              conditions.  They will also help create a better understanding about the
              dynamics of persistence of sourcing relationships. The results will, in
              addition, impact research concerned with the larger issue of IS performance
              management in the context of the virtual organizational form created and
              enabled through
sourcing relationships.
