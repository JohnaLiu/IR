This grant is to partially
              support a six-week Summer Institute in Mathematics for Undergraduates (SIMU). 
              The workshop is designed for Chicano/Lantino and Native Americans, and will be
              help at the University of Puerto Rico, Humacao.  The objectives of SIMU
              include:  providing participants with a rich academic and research experience
              in the mathematical sciences; an introduction to research protocols and
              techniques; building a network of academicians and peers that will help SIMU
              participants excel in their undergraduate Education; an introduction of SIMU
              students to successful Chican/Latino and Native American academicians; to
              enhance the overall academic portfolio of SIMU students; and to monitor the
              educational progress of SIMU participants for the next five years.

This
              grant is being funded through the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the
              Office of Interdisciplinary Activities within the Directorate of Mathematical
              and Physical Sciences.
