Abstract    :
                   The University of Delaware Center for Composite Materials is planning 
              "Composites 2000: An International Symposium on Composite Materials" to be held
              in October 5-8, 1999.  The objective of the symposium is to highlight advances
              in composites materials and manufacturing processes by bringing together
              worldwide leaders in the field to share their extensive knowledge with
              representative of industry, governments, and academia. 
     Four theme areas
              are planned: Materials and Synthesis, Processing Science, Mechanics and Design,
              and Performance.  These are the core areas of research in this country and
              abroad, aimed at providing a better fundamental understanding that will enable
              the exploration of new opportunities and the development of new applications
              for composite materials.  Coverage will consider current state of the art
              complemented by the provision of insights into the future of advanced
              composites for future product manufacture.  Invited speakers will include
              internationally recognized experts to provide keynote talks and session papers.
