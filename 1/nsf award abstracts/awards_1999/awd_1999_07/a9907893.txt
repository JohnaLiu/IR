This U.S.-Czech research project between Gabriel
              Kotliar of Rutgers University and Vaclav Janis of the Czech Institute for
              Physics combines pertinent features drawn from first-principles
              density-functional theory (DFT) approaches to capture the dynamical
              fluctuations caused by strong electron correlations in real materials. This
              effort goes beyond weak-coupling theories to address the quantitative treatment
              of systems in the intermediate and strong-coupling regimes.  Two directions
              will be pursued: 1) the development of advanced many-body techniques and their
              adaptation for realistic multi-band models for study of materials properties
              and 2) extensions of the DFT-LDA (local density approximation) framework to
              incorporate two-body correlations.  Results should lead to development of an
              electronic structure methodology that incorporates in a direct and systematic
              way the effects of correlations on the physical and chemical properties of
              materials.   If successful, this would have a strong impact on quantitative
              theory of the electronic properties of strongly correlated materials, including
              a large number of recently discovered materials such as copper oxides and the
              manganites. 

This materials theory research project fulfills the program
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United
              States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
