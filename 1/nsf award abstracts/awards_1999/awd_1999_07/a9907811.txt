Abstract    :
              Despite the realization that genes affect development, the environment remains a
              critically important domain of learning and socialization--affecting children's
              cognitive, social, and emotional development. Although many studies have
              examined the relationship between environmental processes and development,
              nearly all of this research has examined biologically-related family members
              living together. This makes the research difficult to interpret because family
              environmental influences are confounded with potential genetic influences.
              Another limitation of previous research is that the environment is often
              thought of as a between-family phenomenon (for example socioeconomic status),
              despite the fact that many important environmental differences exist within
              families. The goal of the proposed study is to examine the environment by
              examining adoptive families. Because adoptive families are genetically
              unrelated, it is possible to examine environmental effects upon the development
              of cognitive, social, and emotional skills while controlling for genetic
              factors. Additionally, by studying each child within these adoptive families
              individually, it is also possible to examine environmental similarities and
              differences among family members. By understanding the environment and its
              effect on the development of children, it may be possible to develop targeted
              prevention and intervention programs for improving cognitive and behavioral
              outcomes for all children. Additionally, better understanding of the
              environment helps place the emerging genetic research into context.
