Abstract    :
              The research is primarily directed toward study of nonlinearly viscoelatic
              behavior of soft connective tissues, particularly the constitutive behavior. 
              Because of their simplicity, ligaments are chosen as an experimental model. 
              The research is organized as follow (i) an experimental study will be performed
              that defines viscoelastic behavior throughout the range of reversible ligament
              deformations.  This study will use creep and relaxation plus recovery protocols
              to allow discrimination among various nonlinearities.  (ii) a robust
              viscoelastic constitutive model will be developed from experimental data.  This
              model will appropriately account for nonlinearities and interrelate creep and
              relaxation.  (iii) The reversible deformation limits for levels of applied
              stress and strain (as a function of load-time) will be experimentally
              identified from the data in (I), thus defining the onset of sub-failure tissue
              damage for a single overload.  A sub-failure criterion for the onset of damage
              will be formulated.  (iv) Creep and relaxation testing will be performed on
              additional specimens to quantify the compromise in mechanical behavior after
              higher loading and deformations produce greater levels of tissue damage (from a
              single overload). (v) The microtrauma and damage associated with irreversible
              deformations will be morphologically characterized using scanning electron
              microscopy.
