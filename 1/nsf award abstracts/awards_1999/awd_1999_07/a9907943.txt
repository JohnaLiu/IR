This U.S.-Hungary project between W. Ronald Fawcett of
              the University of California Davis and Gabor Palinkas of the Hungarian Chemical
              Research Center examines ion solvation in aprotic solvents, an area of
              fundamental importance for understanding intermolecular interactions, bulk
              solvation, solvent effects and surface phenomena involving polar groups. Their
              collaborative research plan features three components.  First, Fawcett and
              Palinkas will undertake a theoretical study of ion solvation in acetonitrile
              and dimethyl sulfoxide using ab initio calculation of ion-solvent energy
              surfaces with LiI as the electrolyte.  The information derived will be used in
              subsequent molecular dynamics simulations.  The second and third parts involve
              experimental work, which feature X-ray diffraction studies in Budapest and FTIR
              (Fourier Transform Infrared) studies in Davis.  The overall goal is to provide
              a better understanding of those solvent properties which are commonly described
              as Lewis acidity and basicity.  If successful, the work should yield a quantum
              mechanical description of ion-solvent interactions and results may be
              applicable in areas such as separation, ion chromatography, and battery
              development.

This project in theoretical and experimental physical chemistry
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              leading experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.
