Abstract    :
              The REVEL program was initiated by the Universiyt of Washington in 1996 with the
              intention of involving science educators in oceanographic research.  The
              current proposal requests funds to support the continuation of this project
              during the summer of 1999.  Eight science teachers will participate in a funded
              cruise to study the hydrothermal vent fields on the Endeavour Segment of the
              Juan de Fuca Ridge.
