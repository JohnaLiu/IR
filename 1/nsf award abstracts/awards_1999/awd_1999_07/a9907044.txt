Abstract    :
              This project will explore the utility of the U/Ca ratio in foraminiferal shells
              as a tracer of water temperature and of [CO 3].  Specimens will be cultured in
              the Laboratory under controlled conditions to determine the correlation of U/Ca
              with each variable, and the resulting equations will be tested using natural
              speciments collected in sediment traps from the Sargasso Sea and eastern
              equatorial Pacific.  U/Ca and Mg/Ca analyses will be paired for each analysis
              to determine whether Mg/Ca can be used to control for the temperature
              effect.
