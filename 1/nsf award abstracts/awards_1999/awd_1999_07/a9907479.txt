Abstract    :
              This project will continue petrological and geochemical analyses of samples
              recovered from the East Pacific Rise between the Orozco and Rivera transform
              faults.  The question of the existence of a hotspot contributing magmas to this
              section of mid-ocean ridge requires more detailed analyses and analyses of
              samples from older crust off-axis.  In addition, new questions have been
              identified from the work to date, and these questions will be addressed.
