Abstract    :
              This project will investigate whether the hydrothermal discharge from the
              drowned and breached volcanic crater at Deception Island, Antarctica, is a
              sufficient source of dissolved iron to support the regional primary
              productivity in the ocean.   It is known that insufficient available iron as
              well as other elements can limit biological production, and that over large
              parts of the Southern Ocean inorganic nutrients are under-utilized, with the
              implication that some trace element, most probably iron, is the limiting
              factor.  There are moreover shallow regions within the Bransfield Strait where
              the productivity is 50 to 60 times as great as in the open ocean, where iron is
              presumed to be abundantly available.

The study will trace the discharge
              volume, its iron concentration, and the flushing rate of the crater during a
              cruise of the ice-strengthened research vessel Laurence M. Gould in November
              1999.  That cruise is devoted to the study of how pelagic and benthic
              communities respond to the seasonal variations in the sea ice cover and will
              provide the context for the iron study.
