This goal of this research program is to examine the
              relationship between the population biology and degree of genetic
              differentiation among populations of the spotted salamander, Ambystoma
              maculatum.  First, the patterns of genetic differentiation among lineages of
              Ambystoma breeding populations in central New York will be described using
              nuclear molecular markers (microsatellites) developed specifically for this
              species.  In addition, a detailed field study of one breeding population will
              determine the extent to which individual behaviors such as dispersal, tendency
              to return to specific breeding ponds, and reproductive success contribute to
              these patterns. 

The importance of this study lies in elucidating the
              processes contributing to differentiation and, ultimately, diversity among
              organisms.  The study of how organisms become different species has been a main
              focus among biologists, but is still a mostly unanswered question.  This
              research will investigate how certain life history characteristics and an
              animal's behavior affect the degree to which populations become genetically
              distinct; these processes are possibly the same first steps that affect
              diverging species, thus contributing to the origin and maintenance of
              biodiversity.
