Abstract    :
              The application requests funding for partial support of travel and lodging
              expenses for graduate students and junior faculty to attend the International
              Congress on Chronobiology. This biannual meeting is jointly sponsored by nine
              societies, totaling over 2,000 members in the societies as a whole, each
              represented according to their membership strengths in a series of symposia
              devoted to current research in biological rhythms. The meeting is formatted to
              foster unique opportunities for dialogue and intellectual exchange between
              student and faculty researchers. A special student program will provide "Topic
              Tables" at a student-faculty informal luncheon designed to provide the
              opportunity for small group discussions. Specific topics include methodology of
              biological rhythms, molecular, cellular and genetic aspects of biological
              rhythms, regulation of biological rhythms by environmental factors, hormone,
              melatonin and other substances. Plenary lectures, symposia, datablitz sessions
              and poster presentations will provide trainees with valuable access to the
              latest research strategies across a broad range of disciplines.
