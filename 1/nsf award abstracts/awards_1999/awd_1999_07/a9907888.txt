Private sector participation in the delivery of water and
              wastewater services to urban residents around the globe has increased
              dramatically in recent years.  The UCOWR Annual Meeting will bring together
              researchers from the water resources research institutes of the nation's land
              grant universities, as well as other academics, consultants, and industry
              officials, most with no prior exposure to the privatization issue.  The
              technical session is designed to expose them to a range of perspectives,
              arguments, and experiences.  The phenomenon of privatization is gaining
              momentum and has significant social, economic, and environmental effects and it
              is hoped that this session will highlight some of the key issues and
              information deficits, suggesting a research agenda.  At the close of this
              meeting we hope, through the presentations and discussions, to have not only
              greater understanding of this movement but a sharper focus concerning the
              prominent research needs.  The final product will be included in our annual
              proceeding as a special session that summarizes the findings of this meeting
              and point to specific research needs.
