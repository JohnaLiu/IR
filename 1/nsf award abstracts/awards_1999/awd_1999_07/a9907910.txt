In this project, the large-scale distribution
              of ozone (O3) and aerosols will be investigated in mid-to-high latitudes over
              continental North America as part of the TOPSE (Tropospheric Ozone Production
              about the Spring Equinox) field experiment.  Ozone and aerosol profiles will be
              measured using the NASA Airborne UV DIAL (Differential Absorption Lidar)
              system.  Complete vertical profiles of O3 and aerosol distributions can be
              obtained along the aircraft flight track from near the surface to several
              kilometers above the tropopause, with a vertical resolution 300m in the
              vertical and a few tens of kilometers in the horizontal.  This information will
              be used to investigate the contributions of transport and
              production/destruction in the tropospheric O3 budget, to provide initial
              conditions and validation measurements for O3 models, and to study issues
              related to atmospheric contamination in the Arctic. In collaboration with other
              TOPSE investigators, the DIAL O3 data will be combined with in situ
              measurements of CO, NOx, hydrocarbons, CO2, etc., and aerosol composition and
              size distributions to interpret the large-scale variations of O3.  The lidar
              aerosol measurements will be used to examine the origin and transport
              properties of the aerosols observed in the free troposphere.  The UV DIAL
              measurements of O3 and aerosol distributions will be correlated to the
              thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere, exchange between the stratosphere
              and troposphere, chemical composition of the different air masses, and the
              long-range advection of gases and aerosols in the free troposphere,
              particularly in the high-latitude Arctic.
