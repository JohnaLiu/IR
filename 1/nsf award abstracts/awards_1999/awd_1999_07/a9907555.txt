Abstract    :
              Professor Andrew Gellman will organize a USA-Germany workshop on heterogeneous
              catalysis for fine chemical and speciality chemical production.  The workshop
              will take place on August 26-28, 1999, in New Orleans, following the American
              Chemical Society national meeting.  The focus will be on stereo-, regio-, and
              other selectivity-demanding chemical transformations that are of importance in
              pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and bioactive material industries.  The workshop
              will bring together approximately 40 academic and industrial scientists from
              Germany and the USA to discuss the challenges of ultraselective heterogeneous
              catalysis, and to dientify the opportunities for research and collaborative
              discovery.  Primary emphasis will be placed on novel processes and catalysts
              for fine and specialty chemical manufacturing, kinetic control of chiral
              selectivity, scaleup of ultraselective processes, new asymmetric materials for
              catalysis and separations, combinatorial techniques, and theory and modeling.
