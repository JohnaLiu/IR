Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support Dr. Jean-Francois Richard will acquire
              a Microway 264 DP-2000+ workstation with 1 GB of SDRAM and associated monitor
              and site license. This system will facilitate his economic research in two key
              areas. The first involves very high-dimensional (1000+) numerical integration
              of likelihood functions by importance sampling. Modern econometric models often
              include large numbers of unobserved variables. Such models frequently suffer
              from the fact that important components of individual agents decisions are
              unobserved and have to be accounted for in the form of unobserved random
              heterogeneity and Dr. Richard's work examines how this might most optimally be
              accomplished. The second aspect of his research concerns empirical game
              theoretic models. In recent years this experimental economic approach has
              burgeoned with special emphasis on auctions. By carefully controlling and
              varying game rules one can gain insight into individual player's strategies as
              well as the dynamics of inter-individual interaction. Dr. Richard's work
              examines the underlying principles on which such behaviors are based. The
              workstation will also be available to graduate students and thus have a
              potentially broad impact.
