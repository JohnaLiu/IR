ABSTRACT

OCE-9907471


This work will investigate the biochemical
              factors which control the fate of sulfur from DMSP (dimethylsulfoniopropionate)
              in the upper ocean. DMSP is one of the most abundant and rapidly cycled reduced
              sulfur compounds in the euphotic zone of the oceans, and is an important
              precursor of the chemically active gas dimethyl sulfide (DMS) which is thought
              to have an effect on global climate. The work will investigate the nature of 
              DMSP/DMS cycling and the fate of the sulfur in a variety of ocean settings
              under a variety of conditions. The role of bacteria in the cycling of these
              species will be investigated. Field work will be carried out during four
              expeditions, ranging from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico to the cold
              waters of the Labrador Sea.
