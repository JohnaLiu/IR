Chen

This U.S.-Brazil proposal is for a planning visit by Dr. Peter
              P. Chen, Louisiana State University to meet with Professors Rubens Melo and
              Antonio Furtado of the Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro,
              Brazil to develop a joint workshop on the Internet and database use by
              Brazilian and American scientists.
 
Dr. Chen's experience in computer
              science, particularly entity-relationship models, and storage is complimented
              by Dr. Melo's work in program languages, databases and image processing.
