Abstract    :
              This project involves the measurement of tropospheric mixing ratios of hydrogen
              peroxide, H202, methylhydroperoxide, CH3OOH, and other organic hydroperoxides,
              e.g., CH3C(O)OOH, CH3CH2OOH, HOCH2OOH, on board the NCAR C-130 aircraft during
              the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox experiment (TOPSE).
              TOPSE is a multi-investigator, multi-institutional program designed to study
              the springtime photochemistry of ozone and other contaminant compounds over the
              mid-latitude to polar Northern Hemisphere during the transition from winter to
              spring conditions.  Hydrogen peroxide is a direct product of perhydroxyl
              radicals and the organic hydroperoxides are intermediates in the oxidation of
              most hydrocarbons, as well as, being products of organic peroxyl and
              perhydroxyl radicals.  It is the peroxyl radicals, as well as, nitric oxide
              which are necessary for new ozone production.  The hydroperoxides will be
              measured in situ using an established airborne methodology involving aqueous
              collection of the gaseous hydroperoxides followed by HPLC separation and
              fluorescence detection of a hydroperoxide derivative.  The TOPSE airborne
              hydroperoxide measurements will provide a unique set of distribution
              measurements for this region and time of year and are desirable for comparison
              with the results of developing global 3-dimensional coupled dynamic and
              photochemical models.
