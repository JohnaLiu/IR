Abstract    :
              The PIs will undertake a field program of HMR-1 sonar mapping, magnetics,
              gravity measurements, and dredging in the Mariana arc region to enlarge the
              existing database in area. The mapping is justified as a necessary first step
              toward sorting out the complex nature and sequence of subduction-related
              processes and critical to the goals of the Subduction Factory initiative within
              MARGINS program. The survey will be conducted in two regions of the southern
              Mariana subduction system - in the forearc and the backarc. The work will
              complete and complement similar geophysical data (side scan sonar, magnetics)
              already obtained from the arc. The samples collected by dredging will be used
              for geochemical analyses by other workers.
