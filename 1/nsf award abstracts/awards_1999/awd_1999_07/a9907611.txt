MRPG: Real-Time Biosensor Using FRET on
              Microbeads.

This study is designed to develop biosensor systems suitable for
              detecting
tagged proteins on bead surfaces. The principle of FRET
              (flourescence
resonance energy transfer) is applied. While there are other
              methods
available for the detection of fluorescent proteins, the advantage of
              this
approach over the existing ones lies in its reversibility
              and
generalizability, without the need of soluble components.  The potential
              of
its usefulness is very broad.  The specific aims are to establish
              the
conditions needed to observe analyte-mediated, reversible FRET
              between
tethered components on beads and to examine a selection of
              ligand-receptor
pairs on beads, thus establishing the ligand-receptor
              requirements for a
sensor.
