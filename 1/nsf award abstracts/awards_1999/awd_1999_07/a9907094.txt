Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of new chiral catalysts.  Neutral
              bis(oxazoline) bidentate and pyridine-bis(oxazoline) tridentate ligands will be
              employed in conjunction with cationic copper (2+) and tin (2+) for the
              generation of new families of chiral Lewis acids.  These chiral complexes will
              be investigated in the enantioselective catalysis of ene reactions, hetero
              Diels-Alder reactions, Michael reactions and sigmatropic rearrangements.  In
              addition, chiral metal complexes having a tailored binding pocket for catalysis
              of the aldol reaction will be pursued as will general strategies for the
              catalytic generation of chiral metal enolates. Enantioselective methods for the
              reduction of alpha- and beta-keto esters will also be developed.  Extensive use
              of X-ray crystallography will be carried out in order to probe catalyst
              structure.  

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. David A. Evans of the
              Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University.  Professor
              Evans will focus his work on developing new stereoselective reactions with an
              emphasis on absolute stereochemical control through asymmetric catalysis. 
              Relevant target-oriented natural products syntheses will be pursued to
              illustrate the generality of the reactions being developed.  The work has
              important implications for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral
              fellows and  in the fields of medicine, biology and materials science.
