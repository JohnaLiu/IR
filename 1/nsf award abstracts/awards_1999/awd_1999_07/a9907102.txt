RUI: Investigation of Learning Way-Finding Cues in Robot Foraging
              in a Non-stationary Environment

This project will be an empirical
              investigation of a novel approach to robot learning and its effect on searching
              in a dynamic and non-stationary environment.  The robot will emulate an animal
              foraging for resources while avoiding threats.  Foraging search is a
              general-purpose search method applicable to finding sparse resources in a vast,
              dynamic and non-stationary environment. The specific approach to this problem
              involves learning causal relations between neutral cue stimuli and affective
              stimuli from resources (or
threats). In this study the PI will statistically
              evaluate learning efficacy as it effects success in finding resource objects in
              a large arena when those resources are movable and relations are
              non-stationary. Learning is based on a unique, multi-time scale learning
              mechanism, the adaptrode, which has previously been shown to solve the
              destructive
interference problem.  In this problem, new knowledge may
              overwrite or interfere with previously learned knowledge. In non-stationary
              environments relations may change over time causing a learning system to
              eradicate knowledge of older relations.  But, in such environments, the old
              relations might prove to be valid over longer time scales. With
destructive
              interference, the learner has to relearn what it had previously known. The
              adaptrode can maintain short-, intermediate- and long-term memories, even of
              contrary relations. The research project will involve at least three
              undergraduate students in all phases of the work. It expects to stimulate
              students' interests in research and to enhance their learning experience in
              general.
