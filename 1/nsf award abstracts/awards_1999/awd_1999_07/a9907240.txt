              ABSTRACT

OCE-9907240


The principal investigator on this project will
              convene a Chemical Oceanography Gordon Conference in August, 1999.  The
              objective of this Gordon Conference is to bring together an interdisciplinary
              group of scientists to discuss emerging fields and outstanding controversies
              related to the chemistry of the sea.  Conference topics include, but are not
              limited to, air-sea-carbon dioxide flux, early diagenesis and diagenetic
              modeling, diagenesis and evolution, biogenic carbonate chemistry and
              preservation, development of paleotracers, and surface chemistry.  Speakers and
              discussion leaders have been selected ahead of time from the cadre of leading
              scientists in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. The Chemical Oceanography Gordon
              Conference is generally regarded by the marine chemistry community as one of
              the indispensable benchmark events of each year.
