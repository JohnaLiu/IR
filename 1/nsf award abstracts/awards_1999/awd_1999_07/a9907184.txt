Abstract    :
              Professor Daniel Resasco will organize and develop a workshop on environmental
              catalysis to be held at the University of Litoral, in Santa Fe, Argentina, on
              September 2 and 3, 1999.  It will feature 24 speakers from Argentina, Braxil,
              Chile and the USA, and it will involve the participation of other researchers
              and advanced students of catalysis.  The two major goals are to expose the
              state of scientific advance in the respective countries and to promote
              collaborations between USA and Latin American catalysis researchers.  A related
              workshop in the area of Process Systems Engineering will be held in
              Florianapolis, Braxil.  Both of these activities follow on the recommendations
              produced by the CEPAC (Chemical Engineering Pan American Collaborations), an
              informal organization of researchers that emerged from a NSF-sponsored meeting
              in Rio de Janeiro, Braxil, in 1998.  The workshop will involve also industry
              and funding agencies from Argentina, Chile, and Braxil.
