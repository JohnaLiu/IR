Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for an Engineering Foundation Conference on Metal
              Separation Technologies to be held June 13-19, 1999 at the Turtle Bay Resort,
              Hawaii.  The conference is devoted to interdisciplinary research in the area of
              metal separation technology.  The major topical areas addressed in the
              conference are relevant to the scientific objectives of this program,
              particularly the emphasis on the clean-up of metallic residues from waste
              streams using novel ion exchange media, liquid extraction, and field-induced
              separations.
