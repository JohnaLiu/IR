Abstract    :
              Symbiotic associations between bacteria and eukaryotic hosts are a prominent
              feature in marine systems.  Whether the bacteria reside external to the host or
              endosymbiotically, the role of the association often remains poorly understood.
               This lack of understanding, in part, stems from our inability to cultivate the
              majority of these symbionts free from their host.  Even in instances where
              cultivation is possible, it is unlikely that the physiological capacities of
              bacteria measured in the laboratory truly represnt those in the natural
              ecosysem.  Molecular genetic approaches have the capability to resolve the
              metabolic potential of these bacteria and thereby infer their function in the
              association.  The proposed research seeks to understand the metabolic potential
              of the primary members of a diverse epibiotic bacterial community found
              associated with the tube-dwelling polychaete, Alvinella pompejana.  This
              association exists in a deep-sea hydrothermal vent biotope characterized by
              high concentrations of heavy metals and the steepest thermal gradient
              experienced by an organism yet described.
