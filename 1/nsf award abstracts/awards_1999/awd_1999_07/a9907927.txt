Abstract    :
              Liquefaction is an important cause of damage to civil infrastructures during
              earthquakes.  It is most likely to occur in fine to medium sands or even finer
              non-plastic soils.  An increase of the percentage of plastic fines within the
              soil decreases the likelihood of rearrangement of soil particles during cyclic
              loading and reduces the potential for liquefaction.  Treatment of a soil with
              bentonite increases the percentage of plastic fines, restrains the movements of
              the soil grains, and thus reduces the potential for liquefaction of the soil. 
              As a result, the treated soil performs as a passive autoadaptive material where
              its properties are most useful when an unexpected and potentially catastrophic
              event occurs.                                                                  
                         In this project the following issues are investigated: (1) Changes
              in liquefaction potential of clean sands as a result of the addition of
              bentonite. (2) Corresponding changes in characteristic soil properties such as
              stiffness, strength, and hydraulic conductivity. (3) A novel means by which to
              deliver bentonite suspensions to the soil pores in time-release fashion in
              which the bentonite hydrates after it has been delivered.
