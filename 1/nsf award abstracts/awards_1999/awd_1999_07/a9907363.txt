              for the speakers at the Second NSF/ESF Symposium on "Nanoparticles:
              Technologies and Applications", to be held in Tacoma, WA, on October 10, 1999 
              will be provided.   The meeting will bring together U.S and European scientists
              in the fields of aerosols, materials and health.  The objectives are the
              presentation of the most recent findings in nanoparticle and related
              nanotechnology, evaluation of the research trends and opportunities, and
              enhancement of the long-term U.S.-European collaboration especially among young
              scientists and engineers in both regions.  The ESF sponsored network on
              nanoparticle research will be the co-organizer.   The symposium will consists
              of plenary critique lectures given by senior researchers and poster sessions by
              young researchers.  Twelve young researchers will be selected from the U.S.
              nanoparticle community for invited poster presentations, and they will receive
              partial travel support.  A publication with the extended abstract proceedings
              will be prepared after the meeting.
