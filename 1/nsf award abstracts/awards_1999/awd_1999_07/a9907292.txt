The recommended proposal is for a marine
              geological field program in the eastern equatorial and subtropical Pacific to
              study vertical water mass distributions during the late Pleistocene on
              millennial time scales.  The object of the proposed work is to: 1) serve as a
              site survey for both coring and geophysical data in support of the JOIDES ODP
              Proposal 465/ADD, currently highly ranked by the JOIDES SCICOM with a strong
              likelihood of drilling in the year 2001 or 2002; 2) document the acquired
              sediment cores for investigations of millennial-scale climate and ocean
              variability in the eastern equatorial Pacific; and 3) test the hypothesis that
              episodic ventilation of the intermediate waters of the Pacific Basin results
              from intensified flow of Antarctic Intermediate Water.  Intermediate water
              properties will be examined with benthic foraminiferal species and isotopic
              data. By examining the timing and spatial distribution of climate events
              associated with intermediate waters, it will be assessed whether such changes
              are driven from the Southern or Northern Hemispheres.
