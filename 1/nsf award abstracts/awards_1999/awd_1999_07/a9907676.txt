Abstract    :
              The Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve and Biological Research Station (HPBRS) is a
              not-for-profit membership corporation whose purposes are preservation, and
              research and education in the biological sciences.  The 800 ha preserve
              occupies the region around the Ten Mile Creek, a hanging valley on the
              Helderberg Plateau in Albany County, NY.  Between 1994 and 1998, 52 Ph.D. level
              scientists and 60 graduate students and research assistants have conducted
              studies on the Preserve.  Forty of these researchers received one or more
              grants from the HPBRS to support their work.  These scientists came from 28
              colleges and universities in 13 states and 7 countries.  Since 1994 13 doctoral
              and 11 master candidates conducted research on the Preserve.  Currently 7
              dissertation projects are underway.  Eleven postdoctoral associates have worked
              here in that time.  The HPBRS offers educational opportunities for students of
              all ages including interpretative tours, all-day workshops, teacher training
              workshops, consulting in schools, and Elderhostel.  Since 1994, 2369
              elementary, 1024 secondary, 1360 undergraduates and 310 teachers have visited
              the Preserve to practice hands-on environmental science.

Beginning in 1986,
              the HPBRS embarked on a program to improve its physical facilities to increase
              the numbers of scientists and students utilizing it.  In 1988 research
              equipment in the Eldridge Lab was upgraded.  Over the subsequent two years the
              laboratory building, was winterized, and refurbished as was Lincoln Pond
              Cottage, one of the researcher residences.  In 1992 the HPBRS's Board of
              Directors approved a long-term plan to continue the development of the
              Preserve's infrastructure.  That plan recognized that the Preserve needed an
              enlarged laboratory and more appropriate residences for  visiting researchers. 
              In 1995 the Preserve received support for the laboratory addition.

This
              project will refurbish the four structures collectively known as Bullfrog Camp
              Complex-one of the two primary residences for visiting researchers and
              students.  The work will include rebuilding Bullfrog Camp cabin to increase
              housing space and improve the kitchen and dining areas.  A new bathhouse will
              be built.  Bird House cabin will be renovated and the Horse cabin made into a
              two bedroom facility.  All buildings will be handicap accessible.  The
              refurbishment of Bullfrog camp will increase the ability of the HPBRS to house
              researchers and students in a clean and safe environment.  The refurbishment of
              the Bullfrog Camp Complex will improve the infrastructure needed to allow for
              an increase in research and training in biological field sciences.
