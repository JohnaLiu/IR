Special
              Project:  Computing Research Association's Committee on the Status of Women in
              Computing Research

This award to the Computing Research Association (CRA)
              provides funds to support activities of the Committee on the Status of Women
              (CRA-W).  The CRA-W was established in 1991 with the goal of taking positive
              action to increase the number and success of women in Computer Science and
              Engineering Research, where they are currently significantly underrepresented. 
              CRA-W has initiated a broad range of projects, from the high-school level,
              through the undergraduate and graduate levels, developed workshops for new
              faculty, moderates the "systers-academia" electronic mailing list and edits a
              regular column in the Computing Research News.  In addition, CRA-W provides a
              forum for addressing problems that fall disproportionately within women's
              domains and seeks to have a positive impact for other underrepresented groups
              within Computer Science and Engineering (CS&E).

New projects under
              consideration include hosting a meeting of committees from professional
              organizations that address underrepresention of women, establishing a web-based
              undergraduate research showcase, expanding their faculty mentoring workshops,
              maintaining a web-based resume service for women with Ph.D. degrees in CS&E
              fields, and developing a leadership workshop for women who could potentially
              move into leadership positions either on their campuses or at the national
              level.

Most CRA-W projects are funded individually.  However, this award
              provides funds to support the basic activities of the committee including
              travel support for one steering committee and one full committee meeting each
              year and a minimal amount of staff support.
