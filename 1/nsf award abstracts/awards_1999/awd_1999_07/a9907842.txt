	This grant involves funds for the purchase of a 7
              Tesla/90cm bore NMR imaging/spectroscopy instrument for the Center for Magnetic
              Resonance Research (CMRR) at the University of Minnesota.  Only recently has it
              been possible to develop the necessary instrumentation and methodology, explore
              the potential and establish the advantages of the higher fields to extract
              complementary functional and biochemical information.  A significant part of
              that work was realized at the CMRR.  The 7T/90 system will enable a major lead
              in these developments and provide a mechanism by which this unique
              instrumentation, spin-physics methodology and expertise are available to
              researchers in the USA and elsewhere.

	Unraveling the mysteries of the human
              brain represents one of the great challenges of modern biology.  Recently,
              developed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided a unique
              capability towards meeting this challenge.  Further developments to improve
              sensitivity, spatial specificity and spatial resolution and extend the
              methodology to temporally resolved true single event related studies require
              higher neuronal activation and significant increases in the magnitude of the
              inherently weak signal changes that are used in fMRI.  In going to 7 Tesla,
              these combined gains are expected to catapult this methodology to a level that
              is significantly beyond what is currently available.  Equally important are
              recent efforts relying on detection of key intracellular bioenergetics and
              neuronal activity.  However, additional gains in sensitivity and spectral
              resolution available at 7T are needed to make a significant impact on the
              biological problem.
