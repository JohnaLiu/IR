The Computer-Assisted Translation of Alaska Native Languages
              (CATANAL) Project is designed to explore the application of computational
              linguistics, machine translation, speech recognition and optical character
              recognition to the translation and preservation of Alaska Native languages. The
              urgent need to preserve and translate the Alaska Native languages derives from
              a number of problems in the social and natural sciences, as well as
              educational, political, and economic problems caused by powerful forces that
              are shaping events in the Arctic at the turn of the millennium. This project
              will develop a succinct statement of the most important needs in translation
              and preservation of the Native Languages and what role computational
              linguistics can play in addressing these problems. This project will support a
              workshop involving parties interested in this problem. The workshop is planned
              for May 19-22, 1999 at the new International Arctic Research Center (IARC) at
              the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). The workshop has been preceded by
              organizational and steering committee activities. Following the workshop a
              report will be produced and disseminated. This project is jointly supported
              with a number of organizations in the State of Alaska.
