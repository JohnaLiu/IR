Support is provided to complete the data assembly of the
              current meter data 
collected during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
              (WOCE). The other 
purpose of this Data Assembly Center (DAC) is to process
              the data if necessary 
to a consistent standrad, make the data available to
              all interested scientists and 
finally submit them to the national Ocean Data
              Center for worldwide distribution. 
Access to the data is via a Web site and
              CD-ROMs.
