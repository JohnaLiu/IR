This project will evaluate the potential for using
              releases of mice (Mus musculus) onto "mouse-free" man-made islands off the
              coast of Louisiana to test hypotheses concerning the effects of captive
              breeding and inbreeding on population viability under natural conditions. 
              Funds will be used to establish a captive population, conduct assessments of
              genetic variation, characterize mammal and vegetation communities, and assess
              the effects of inbreeding and captive breeding on the survival of released
              individuals. 

Many species of mammals are being reared in captivity because
              their existence in the wild is threatened, in the hope that wild populations
              can be re-established using captive-bred individuals once conditions for
              survival in natural habitats become more favorable. There has been considerable
              concern about the effects of inbreeding and captive breeding on the ability of
              released individuals to establish viable wild populations.  In mammals, studies
              of the effects of captive breeding and inbreeding have largely been limited to
              examining effects on the performance of individuals in captivity.  This
              exploratory research has the potential for developing a Mus-island system
              useful for studying how captive breeding and inbreeding, as well as other
              factors, affect the fate of wild populations.  Information resulting from this
              research will aid in the management and restoration of endangered and
              threatened mammals.
