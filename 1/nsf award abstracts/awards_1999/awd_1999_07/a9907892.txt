DLI International: Integrating and Navigating Eprint Archives Through
              Citation-Linking

This is the first year funding of a three year continuing
              award.  In this project, a 3-way partnership involving researchers from
              Southampton University, Cornell University, and the Los Alamos National
              Laboratory will hyperlink each of the over 100,000 papers in Los Alamos's
              unique online Physics Archive to every other paper in the archive that it
              cites.  It is hoped that the power of this remarkable new way of navigating the
              scientific journal literature will help induce authors in others fields to join
              to create interlinked online archives like Los Alamos across disciplines and
              around the world.
