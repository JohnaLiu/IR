Abstract    :
                   Processing of novel thermoset laminated composites with nanofiber
              reinforced interfaces is addressed in this Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              (SGER) project.  Reinforcement of interfaces is expected to improve fracture
              resistance of composites.  Methods of distribution of small fibers in a thin
              interfacial layer between the plies reinforced with conventional fibers will be
              explored.  Small fiber impregnation with resin and composite consolidation will
              be studied by scanning acoustic microscopy.  Interlaminar fracture properties
              and micromechanisms will be experimentally characterized and correlated with
              processing parameters.  Optimum bonding of the nanofibers and resin will be
              experimentally analyzed.  
     If the distribution and expected contribution
              of the nanofibers to the composite can be realized, the results of this work
              will form a fundamental basis for the future development of cost effective,
              microcrack arresting, delamination resistant, hybrid thermoset composites.
