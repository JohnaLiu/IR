Wagener
This dissertation-enhancement award supports K.B. Wagener's
              graduate student Jason Smith to spend three months at the Max Planck Institute
              for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany working with the Institute Director,
              Gerhard Wegner, and with professor Guenter Lieser.  The research will focus on
              branching in polyethylene using step polymerization procedures.  Mr. Smith will
              gather X-ray and electron diffraction data on model polymers.  His research
              will be guided by professors Wegner and Lieser, and he will produce the first
              data of its kind ever generated for precisely branched polyethylene.
