Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to investigate structure-function relationships
              for adsorbed enzymes in an integrated manner using a battery of experimental
              tools.  These include a set of complementary, non-invasive spectroscopic and
              imaging tools to quantitatively analyze the adsorbed layer structure on
              well-characterized surfaces.  Also, a new assay to non-invasively measure the
              rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions on exactly the 
same types of surfaces
              would be used.  Quantities to be determined include adsorption isotherms and
              kinetics, structural information on both individual molecules and the adsorbed
              layer, active site accessibility, and enzyme activity.
