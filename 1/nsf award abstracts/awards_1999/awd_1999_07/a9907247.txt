Abstract    :
              This project uses combined GPS and underwater acoustic geodetic techniques. 
              Recent results indicate that the convergence of the Juan de Fuca and the North
              America plates across the northern Cascadia subduction zone is more northerly
              than models predict.  A similar experiment will be conducted across the
              southern Cascadia subduction zone off the Oregon coast.  Another recent result
              indicates that there was no motion across the Cleft segment of the Juan de Fuca
              ridge over a two-year period even though there was steady motion of the Juan de
              Fuca plate.  Thus, this work will try to document whether the strain deficiency
              is being accommodated in the immediate flanking ridges or in a more widely
              distributed manner.
