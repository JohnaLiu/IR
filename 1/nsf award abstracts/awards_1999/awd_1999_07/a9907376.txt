The PIs propose a field sampling program at the summit of the
              Greenland ice cap to examine the effects of energy from the sun on the
              chemistry of organic compounds contained in the interstitial air trapped in
              snow.  The results of the research will be used to determine if the chemistry
              of the air/snow changes through time in response to fluctuations in light
              energy penetrating the snow.  The study is critical to developing a method for
              interpreting ice core records for the history of atmospheric chemistry in the
              past.  The photochemical process under study could lead to more accurate
              interpretations of past atmospheric conditions and provide better estimates of
              both natural and anthropogenic impacts on the atmosphere from changing climate
              or human activities.  The results of the research will also provide evidence of
              the role of the Greenland ice sheet on modern atmospheric chemistry that will
              be critical to understanding how high-latitude processes affect the
              atmosphere.
