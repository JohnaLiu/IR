Damage due to buckling of thin-walled, steel circular tanks
              under severe wind conditions is investigated by means of numerical methods. 
              The tanks are representative of cylindrical tanks that failed during hurricanes
              in the last decade in the US Caribbean Islands and Puerto Rico, including
              hurricanes Hugo, and Luis, Marilyn and George.  The research will establish a
              catalogue of tanks found in the islands and of damage detected after major
              hurricanes.  Some of the tanks that failed are short, with radius to thickness
              ratio of 1,900 and height to radius ratio of 5.  Several models will be
              employed to simulate the shell response and instability, including bifurcation
              buckling from a linear fundamental equilibrium path; non-linear static analysis
              of imperfect tank; and nonlinear dynamic response.  Wind action will be modeled
              using several pressure distributions in the circumferential direction and vary
              gust durations.  Elastic and elastro-plastic constitutive modeling will be
              employed.  The project will identify the dominant buckling mechanics for each
              type of tank, so as to establish comparisons and validation with observed
              damage and failures found.  Tanks that did not fail will also be employed to
              calibrate the models.  It is expected that deficiencies in designs will be
              highlighted by the research, and ways to improve current designs will be
              proposed.
