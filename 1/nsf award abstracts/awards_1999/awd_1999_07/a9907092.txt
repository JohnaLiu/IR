Abstract    :
              As part of the CASES-99 program (Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange
              Study-1999), the PI, in collaboration with Dr. Jielun Sun of the University of
              Colorado, will employ hot film anemometers to measure the contribution of the
              smallest resolvable turbulent eddies to the vertical fluxes of heat and
              momentum. In stable, nocturnal conditions which are the focus of the CASES
              program, turbulent eddies near the ground are so small as to be undetectable by
              traditional observing means, such as sonic anemometers. In addition to
              evaluating the importance of the small and previously unobserved eddies, the
              investigators will study the relative importance of radiative and sensible heat
              fluxes in the energy balance of the boundary layer and determine the extent to
              which the Monin-Obukov similarity theory, developed for convective boundary
              layers, may have application in the stable boundary layer. The phenomenon of
              turbulence intermittency will also be studied, using data from an instrumented
              tower, lidars, radar wind profilers, and aircraft.
