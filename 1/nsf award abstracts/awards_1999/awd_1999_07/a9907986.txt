Abstract    :
              The Washington State Information Technology Workforce and Education Initiative
              (WITI) is a statewide collaborative project to examine and quantify Information
              Technology (IT) workforce demands and seek expedient, cost-effective solutions
              to current and future demands.  Through this twenty-four month project, the
              NorthWest Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET) and its partners identify
              and catalog Washington state IT workforce demands, as well as available IT
              educational programs.  This gap analysis leads to the development of new IT
              programs and, with state support, to the strengthening and updating of existing
              IT programs.  This project also leads to "turnkey" solutions that allow
              educational institutions to rapidly launch or enhance IT programs. 
              Additionally, this project enhances the scope and value of NWCET activities by
              accelerating the rate and expanding the impact of the work of the NWCET and the
              Regional Advanced Technology Education Consortium (RATEC).  The result is the
              development of a nationally adaptable, statewide "Best Practices" replication
              model.
