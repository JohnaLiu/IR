This Americas Program award will support travel and related
              expenses for a group of US and Latin American students to attend The Third
              Latin American Workshop on Nuclear and Heavy Ion Physics, that will take place
              in San Andres, Colombia, on September 13-17, 1999.  Organizers are Dr. Philip
              Cole, U. of Texas, El Paso, and Dr. Fernando Cristancho, Universidad Nacional,
              Bogota, Colombia.  The aim of the project is is to promote dialog among faculty
              members and students of North and Latin American institutions, with the purpose
              to reach common research interests and goals and the opportunity to coordinate
              programs in nuclear physics research.  Through this effort, they expect to
              strengthen links and forge new ones within the broad scope of the international
              nuclear physics community.  These links will help to foster the recruitment of
              high-caliber graduate level students to pursue research at US institutions and
              laboratories.  This will help to alleviate the shortage of graduate students
              pursuing advanced degrees in experimental and theoretical nuclear physics ,that
              is felt a present in the national laboratories..
