Abstract    :
              An ion microprobe (secondary ion mass spectrometer) study of the halogens (Cl,
              F), volatiles (CO2, H2O, S), light elements (B, Li) and their relevant isotopic
              compositions (7Li/6Li, 11B/10B, 34S/32S and 37Cl/35Cl) will be carried out on
              well-characterized East Pacific Rise (EPR) glasses from the 9 degrees N, 12
              degrees N, and 15-16degrees N regions.  Assimilation of seawater components
              into basaltic magma along the global ocean ridge system may be more widespread
              than is commonly assumed.  At fast-spreading ridges such as the EPR where axial
              magma chambers are well-defined, this process may be ubiquitous.  There is
              currently a poor understanding of the seawater-component assimilation process
              on the local spatial scale of volcanic features and petrologic segmentation. 
              This work will use different geochemical tools, each with its own response to
              the assimilation process and look at segments of the ridge system where small
              differences in spreading rate, volcanic edifice, lithospheric structure and
              axial magma chamber morphology can be recognized. The purpose of this study is
              to determine how and where seawater component assimilation occurs in the
              oceanic lithosphere, to relate differences in the extent of this process to
              volcanic and morphologic features of the oceanic ridge system.
