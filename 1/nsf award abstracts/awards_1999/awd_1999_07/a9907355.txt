Abstract    :
              This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science
              Foundation, provides support for a special conference, the Cassidy Symposium,
              which has been organized to honor Dr. William Cassidy, the founder of the NSF
              sponsored Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET). The objective of the
              Cassidy Symposium is to provide a forum for discussion of the impact that the
              collection and analysis of Antarctic meteorites have had on research in
              planetary science and on studies related to the Antarctic ice sheet. The timing
              of the symposium coincides with the retirement from the Department of Geology
              and Planetary Science at the University of Pittsburgh of Dr. William A.
              Cassidy, who founded ANSMET and led 15 expeditions to Antarctica beginning in
              1976 that resulted in the collection of 7500 meteorites. To date, ANSMET has
              collected about 10,000 meteorites and is an exceptionally valuable scientific
              resource for researchers worldwide. Funds from NSF will be used to defer the
              costs of attendance at the symposium by undergraduate and graduate students and
              to provide travel expenses for two of the invited speakers.
