Investigators at Oregon State University, University of
              North Carolina, and Columbia University will collaborate on an intensive
              five-year study to combine a unique set of observational tools and ocean and
              atmosphere models to investigate the circulation, biology, and chemistry of the
              Oregon coastal ocean.  This project is under the auspices of the Coastal Ocean
              Processes (CoOP) Program and is in response to an Announcement of Opportunity
              for Wind-Driven Process Studies in the Northeast Pacific. The area to be
              studied on the Oregon shelf responds strongly to wind forcing during both
              summer, when mean winds favor upwelling, and winter, when mean winds favor
              downwelling.  

A set of scientific hypotheses related to cross-shelf
              transport processes in a wind-driven system will be addressed by conducting
              field experiments together with coordinated ocean circulation/ ecosystem and
              atmospheric modeling. The hypotheses are: (1) the presence of upwelling and
              downwelling jets and fronts locally alters cross-shelf circulation in the
              surface and bottom boundary layers and in the interior; (2) alongshore
              topographic variations dictate the relative importance of two-dimensional
              versus three-dimensional cross-shelf transport processes; (3) patterns of
              turbulence on the shelf during upwelling and downwelling are influenced by
              fronts and jets, and the levels of turbulence can reach sufficient intensity to
              influence the mesoscale circulation; (4) the magnitude and distribution of
              primary production on the shelf and its subsequent transport offshore is
              controlled solely by the geometry of upwelling; (5) alongshore variations in
              turbulent mixing control the magnitude and distribution of primary production;
              and (6) the reduced cross-shelf transport implied by the presence of a
              downwelling front allows nutrients, trace metals and seed stocks of
              phytoplankton and zooplankton to accumulate in the mid- to inner shelf, thus
              priming the system for a strong biological response at the outset of
              upwelling.

To address the hypotheses, intensive observations will be made in
              two regions: one in a region of relatively simple topography and one in a
              region of abrupt topography. High-resolution sampling will be conducted using
              ships, an instrumented aircraft, a set of moorings, and a land-based coastal
              radar to make high -spatial resolution surface current maps. A high-resolution,
              three-dimensional shelf circulation and coupled ecosystem ocean model will be
              used in direct support of the field experiments by contributing to the
              dynamical synthesis of the observations and for relevant process studies. A
              mesoscale atmospheric modeling effort will provide estimates of surface
              forcing, continuous in space and time, for the ocean model and for
              interpretation of the oceanic observations.

These measurements bring
              together a unique set of observational tools not previously applied
              simultaneously to the study of coastal dynamics. Coordinated with ocean
              circulation/ecosystem and atmospheric modeling, the proposed effort will
              significantly advance our understanding of cross-shelf transport processes on
              wind-driven continental shelves.
