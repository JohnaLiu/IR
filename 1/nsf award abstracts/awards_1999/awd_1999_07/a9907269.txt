This award provides partial funding support for a workshop
              on "Mineral Physics and Earth Materials Research."  The workshop will draw
              approximately 20 leading members of the mineral physics research community to
              assess  the present state and future prospects of the field.  A report will be
              written and submitted to a committee of the National Academy of Sciences
              currently conducting a more general study on the broad topic of research
              opportunities in the solid earth sciences.
