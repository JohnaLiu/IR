	This award provides seventy-percent partial funding support
              for the acquisition of instrumentation to be used in field-based research on
              the hydraulics of high-gradient, bedrock and boulder-bed streams. Field
              deployment of the instrument package will be directed by the Principal
              Investigator and her research team from the Department of Earth Resources at
              Colorado State University. The Colorado State University is committed to
              providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition. The hydraulic regimes
              of high-gradient rivers are not well understood, primarily due to a lack of
              detailed measurements of velocity distribution, secondary flow, surface-water
              gradients, and hydraulic forces acting on channel boundaries. The instrument
              system to be acquired will allow measurements of the detailed datasets
              necessary for understanding hydraulics and flow energy expenditure along these
              rivers.
