Abstract    :
              The Information and Data Management Program (IDM) workshop on Data
              Visualization, to be held at the University of Memphis on June 18 and 19, 1999
              has the objective to bring together some PIs and co-PIs currently funded along
              with researchers from related disciplines in cognitive science and ergonomics
              in order to: 

1) Identify the problems that are fundamental in making
              progress towards organizing and visually presenting user-understandable visual
              display of complex, distributed, and massive amounts of data, 
2) Specify
              areas where major breakthroughs appear possible,
3) Identify research
              infrastructures needed to meet current and future challenges.

This workshop
              aims at enabling communication and future collaboration among researchers from
              the different communities involved in the IDM program, including database,
              multi-media data, and methods for integration of complex data for easy human
              comprehension.  Further, the workshop provides an opportunity to examine the
              current research efforts and to learn more about successes of the researchers
              funded not only the IDM program, but from other agencies and companies.
