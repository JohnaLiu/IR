Abstract    :
              

Results of more than sixty years of scientific investigation at the Coweeta
              Hydrologic Laboratory have established the LTER site as a national and
              international center for forest ecosystem and hydrologic research.  When
              combined with other research activities, more than 150 investigators are
              currently conducting studies at Coweeta.  This tremendous site use by visiting
              investigators has greatly out-paced logistical support and there is a need to
              improve all aspects of Coweeta facilities.  A comprehensive multi-phase
              facilities plan has been developed to meet current and future research,
              education, and training needs.  The 2185-ha laboratory site, located in the
              southern Applalachian Mountains of North Carolina hosts cooperative research
              jointly administrated by the Southern Research Station (SRS) and the University
              of Georgia (UGA).  Within the past five years, the research program has
              substantially broadened to include regional analyses of causes and consequences
              of land-use change in the southern Appalachians as part of the LTER
              program.

This project will support the implementation of the Facilities
              Development Plan for the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory.  Specifically, the
              project will expand and renovate the present dormitory which will increase
              living space to accommodate 24 investigators and also better utilize existing
              space.
