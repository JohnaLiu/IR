Abstract    :
              Partial support is provided for the 6th international Aeromonas/Plesiomonas
              Symposium, which is being held as a satellite conference with the 99th annual
              meeting of the American Society for Microbiology in Chicago, Illinois.  This
              symposium has been held every 2 to 4 years since the first meeting in
              Manchester, England in 1986, with the location alternating between the United
              States and an overseas country.  The current symposium is focussing on new
              identification and classification methods, as well as physiological and
              metabolic activities as they relate to the aquatic environment.  Aeromonas and
              Plesiomonas genera represent a significant part of the aquatic microbiota, but
              are incompletely understood in terms of their genetics, identification,
              physiology and ecology.  There is increasing research in these areas, and this
              symposium will enable researchers to come together, share current information,
              and discuss priority areas for future research.   Funding is providing partial
              support for the operation of the meeting and travel funds for critical
              investigators who cannot otherwise attend the meeting.
