This award supports collaboration between Dr. Esther
              Gallant, University of Minnesota, and Dr. Angela Dulhunty, Australian National
              University, on "Regulation of Ryanodine-Receptor by the DHP-Receptor".  This is
              a project to study the regulation of the ryanodine receptor of muscle cells. 
              Specific goals of the proposal are to use receptors reconstituted in artificial
              membranes to determine concentrations of co-proteins and ligands necessary for
              optimal channel function and to study channel function under these conditions
              when activated by peptides from the dihydropyridine receptor.
