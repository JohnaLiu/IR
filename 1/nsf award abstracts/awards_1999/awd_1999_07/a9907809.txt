The IEEE research area of Plasma Science has evolved until it
              has a 600 to 650 person conference attendance including a substantial
              international contingent at its annual scientific meeting. The areas included
              in this research for 1999 include: 1) basic processes in fully and partially
              ionized plasmas; 2) microwave generation and microwave/plasma interaction; 3)
              intense electron and ion beams; 4) high energy density plasma and applications;
              5) industrial/commercial applications of plasmas; 6) plasma diagnostics; and 7)
              pulsed power and other plasma technology applications. A detailed listing of
              the sub-areas can be found in the enclosed Conference Announcement.

Due to
              rather tight travel budgets on most university research grants, few graduate
              students and new researchers attend these meetings. We wish to encourage
              increased attendance by this group at the meeting to be held in Monterey. We
              are seeking funds for travel and per diem for graduate students and new
              researchers to be selected by Professor Ronald Gilgenhach, Graduate Student
              Travel Grants Chairman. These funds will be processed through the IEEE
              conference account "IEEE 1999 ICOPS" which is subject to audit by IEEE.

We
              have several aspects of this meeting, which we feel are innovative and add to
              the attractiveness for travel support for this new research group. Advanced
              concepts on vacuum electronics and microelectronics, new computational methods
              in simulations of plasmas and electron beams, advanced plasma processing of
              materials and flat panel displays, fusion innovations are being carried out and
              in which increased interest is present. We hope that the cross-fertilization
              and increased attendance of conference attendees in the vacuum electronics and
              pulsed power areas will enhance the conference as well as the value to the new
              researchers attending the meeting.

In addition, this conference precedes the
              IEEE Pulsed Power Conference so we hope to attract a large diversity of
              participants. Our plenary talks at the meeting will also reflect the diversity
              and basic science nature of the ICOPS plasma community.
