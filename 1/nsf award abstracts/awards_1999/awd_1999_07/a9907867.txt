Abstract    :
              The proposed research will explore the application of systematic techniques for
              parameter estimation based on inverse methods to climate models having
              realistic dynamical complexity but with ideal physical parameterizations. These
              techniques seek to find parameters and empirically derived forcing corrections
              that minimize the deviation of the climate model solution from analyzed
              atmospheric phase space trajectories in the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. This
              approach may be viewed as using atmospheric circulation data in order to
              improve subsequent forecasts and climate model simulations. The goals of the
              proposed research are (i) to assess the potential for the application of these
              techniques in this idealized setting with an eye toward application to more
              realistic climate models, (ii) to study and understand the skill and reasons
              for loss of skill for climate models with empirical physical parameterizations
              in AMIP-style simulations forced by atmospheric boundary conditions, and (iii)
              to use these techniques to attribute cause and effect in the problem of
              understanding the catalytic role of midlatitude atmospheric dynamical processes
              in the response of the climate to imposed forcing. The work is important
              because it will yield insights into  improving climate forecasts through more
              realistic climate model simulation.
