Abstract    :
              This collaborative research project is carried out by Leonard Pitt at the
              University of Illinois and H. V. Jagadish at the University of Michigan,
              drawing on Professor Pitt's experience in computational learning theory, and
              Professor Jagadish's expertise in databases. The goal of this research is to
              develop a theoretical framework for investigating data mining problems, and to
              adapt existing machine learning algorithms and develop new ones within the
              framework. Typically, the focus of Machine Learning algorithms is on learning a
              single classifier that works well for most of the (labeled) data, whereas data
              mining focuses on learning "heuristic" rules, typically on unlabeled data, that
              give insight into the nature of the data. By unifying techniques from the
              former area with goals of the latter, new clustering algorithms are developed
              that deal with massive data sets via sampling, yet provide optimality
              guarantees. The research also provides criteria that data mining practitioners
              may apply in deciding whether aggregation or sampling is a preferred data
              reduction technique for the task at hand. Algorithms for new and useful types
              of data patterns are designed, and algorithms that incorporate the user into
              the data-mining task are analyzed and developed within the framework.
