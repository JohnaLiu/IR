Abstract    :
              This is an integrated geochemical and geochemical investigation of crustal
              accretion, comparing two supersegments with strikingly different geometry along
              a 900-km section of the SW Indian Ridge from 10E to 23E.  The objectives of the
              study are to determine the segmentation and gravity structure of the previously
              unmapped highly oblique ridge supersegment, and to obtain a representative
              sampling of the two supersegments to ascertain their geology, ridge
              architecture, and geochemistry, and how these have responded to dramatically
              diferent mantle upwelling rates and spreading geometry.
