A theoretical framework for
              better understanding and prediction of physical chemistry, fluid flow and
              powder mechanics processes in binder granulation will be developed.  The basic
              process consists in agglomeration of fine powders into larger granules using
              liquid binder. Granule growth, consolidation, deformation and breakup will be
              simulated and compared to experimental results.  Experiments will be performed
              in a laboratory constant shear Couette granulator.  Large-scale laboratory (at
              CCNY) and pilot scale granulators (at Procter and Gamble Co.) will be used to
              verify the scale-up capabilities of the simulations.   This is a GOALI
              university-industry collaborative research project between CCNY and Procter and
              Gamble Co.  The industrial principal investigator will co-direct the research
              and co-mentor the doctoral student. Periodical visits and other interactions
              are planned between the university and industrial personnel.  
If successful,
              the project will provide a new method and a predictive tool to design and scale
              up granulators in a variety of processes in chemical, pharmaceutical and food
              industries.
