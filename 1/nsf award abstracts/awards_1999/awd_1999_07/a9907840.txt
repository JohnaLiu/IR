Abstract

	This grant is being used for the purchase of a 600
              MHz wide bore NMR spectrometer for solid state NMR of biological macromolecules
              and macromolecular assemblies.  Structures to be studied include membrane
              proteins, sub-cellular assemblies and organelles.  Processes to be studied
              include protein folding, structural analysis of catalysis, biopolymers and
              other chemical systems.  The instrument is being installed in the NMR facility
              at Stoney Brook that is being created through the new structural biology
              initiative.  The major users will focus on problems of membranes, membrane
              protein structure and signal transduction, collaborating with research groups
              involved in the study of these processes at Stony Brook.
