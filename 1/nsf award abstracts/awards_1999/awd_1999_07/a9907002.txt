Abstract    :
              This award is a follow-on to a previously funded project to develop "An In Situ
              Flow Cytometer for the Optical Analysis of Individual Particles in
              Seawater"(94-16551). The PI's have completed two generations of the in situ
              flow cytometer, however they have not completed final testing and the
              scientific community is not convinced that the instrument is reliable. 
              Therefore, this award will allow the PI's to complete final testing and
              development of the in situ flow cytometer and generate some data by which the
              oceanographic community can assess its potential.
