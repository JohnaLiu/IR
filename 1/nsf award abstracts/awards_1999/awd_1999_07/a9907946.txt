Proposal Title: Phenomenological Aspects of the Solar
              Dynamo

Principal Investigator: Kenneth Schatten, AI Solutions  

The
              investigators will study phenomenological aspects of the dynamo process that
              generates the magnetic field of the Sun. Ability to predict the magnetic
              activity of the Sun is important both to advance knowledge of the underlying
              physics and to mitigate potential societal impacts of solar variability. The
              main effort of the research project is to develop the investigator's SODA
              (Solar Dipole Amplitude) index to improve the understanding of the interior
              fields of the Sun. Particular emphasis will be placed on estimating the amount
              of "buried solar magnetic flux" that can emerge to form the surface field and
              participate in solar activity.
