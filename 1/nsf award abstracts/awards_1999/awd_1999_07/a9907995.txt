The project is a modeling study of the interaction of
              buoyancy-driven and transient wind-driven currents.  Analysis of data from
              Hudson and Columbia River plumes will be performed.  And for their
              interpretations, numerical runs using SPEM (version 5.1) will be carried out in
              the parameter space of the observed plumes.
