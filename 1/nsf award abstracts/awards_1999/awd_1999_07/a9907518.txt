This Americas Program award will support travel and related
              expenses for 10 US scientists and teachers and researchers from various
              countries of Central and South America to participate in an international
              workshop on Ascomycetes, to be held in Caracas, Venezuela, August 26-31, 1999.
              The workshop will be held in conjunction with the Latin American Association of
              Mycology Congress (ALM).  Organizers are Dr. Donald H. Pfister, Harvard
              University and Dr. Teresa Iturriaga, Simon Bolivar University, Caracas.  US and
              Latin American graduate students enrolled in systematic programs will be
              included as participants. 

Ascomycetes comprise a major group of fungi that
              are economically important as plant pathogens, as sources of pharmaceuticals,
              and in industrial processing, and they are equally critical in the ecosystem
              dynamics.  Their diversity has only begun to be addressed, with many
              undescribed species. The overall diversity is highest in the wet forests and
              rain forests of the tropical regions of South America, and it is such areas
              that can benefit from intensive collections and study by resident mycologists.
              Through this workshop Latin American mycologists will be introduced to the
              various groups of the fungi, and encouraged to continue the research.  In this
              venue, ideas and current research findings can be shared with present and/or
              potential Latin American researchers, and the direct and personal contact can
              lead to constructive projects and collaborations which ultimately will help to
              shape biodiversity studies in understudied areas.
