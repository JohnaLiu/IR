Abstract    :
              Novel esters of carotenols and chlorins (Carotenol-Chlorin-Esters, CCEs) were
              recently discovered by the investigator in sediments from the Oman and Peru
              margin, the Southern California Bight, and Monterey Bay.  The chlorins
              associated with CCEs were pheophorbide a and pyropheophorbide a, degradation
              products of chlorophyll a (Chl a).  Isofucoxanthin-dehydrate and
              isofucoxanthinol-dehydrate, degradation products of fucoxanthin and a biomarker
              for diatoms, were the only carotenols associated with CCEs.  The PI also found
              CCEs in water column samples in regions dominated by diatoms and CCEs were
              found in the fecal pellets of a copepod fed diatoms in the laboratory.  It is
              suggested that CCEs are produced by enzymatically mediated transesterifications
              in copepods grazing on diatoms.  Thus, sedimentary CCEs could be markers for
              new production derived from diatoms and the organic carbon and nitrogen
              isotopic signature would reflect that of the diatoms that contributed to the
              flux of carbon to the sediments.  A set of laboratory experiments will further
              corroborate this hypothesis.  Initially experiments will be performed with the
              copepod, Calanus pacificus, that is present year-round off California. Matched
              water column and sediment trap samples from the Santa Barbara Basin and
              Monterey Bay, covering all seasons, will be used to relate the production of
              CCEs to phytoplankton community structure and other environmental factors.
