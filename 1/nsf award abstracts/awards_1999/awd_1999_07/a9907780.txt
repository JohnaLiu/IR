Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for US students (undergraduate or graduate) to
              attend the International Congress on Membranes and Membrane Processes (ICOM) to
              be held June 12-18, 1999 in Toronto, Canada.  This conference is an important
              international conference for the researchers interested in membrane technology-
              an important focus area of this program.  The list of topics to be covered at
              the conference is comprehensive and provides an ideal opportunity for students
              to be exposed to the latest ideas in the field.
