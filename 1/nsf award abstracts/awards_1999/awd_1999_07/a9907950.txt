Long-term studies on changes in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic
              seabird populations are presently emerging as important tools for monitoring
              the effects of human activity, and for understanding and modeling interactions
              between climate change and ecosystem responses.  Despite research that in some
              regions now spans five decades, attempts to integrate the existing population
              data have been limited to qualitative assessments focused primarily on the
              penguins. This means that the status of many Southern Ocean seabirds remains
              essentially unknown.  Also, for the species whose population status in known,
              it has not been possible to discern if the trends in evidence are statistically
              significant.  This has created a serious deficiency in our ability to detect
              and understand the causal factors affecting seabird population and to translate
              this knowledge into basic and applied research, including the management of
              Antarctic marine living resources.  This award will provide partial support for
              an international workshop with the following objectives: to identify and
              catalogue existing long-term data bases on Antarctic and sub-Antarctic seabird
              populations, to subject the extant data to rigorous statistical analysis with
              the aim of determining the scope, magnitude and significance of the population
              trends, and to disseminate the results to relevant Antarctic scientific working
              groups and the general research community.
