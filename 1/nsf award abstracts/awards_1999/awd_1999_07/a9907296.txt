SGER: Making Web Publishing Irreversible 


The current model
              of electronic journal publishing is one in which libraries buy access to a web
              version of a journal, usually by the year.  In this model, the "bits" are not
              acquired by a client, and thus there is limited trust in future availability. 
              This project will attempt to solve this structural problem within the current
              model by applying innovative practices based on established librarian
              techniques.  This project will explore development of a collaborative,
              easy-to-use, distributed replicated web cache.  Libraries choose which journals
              to subscribe to and cache.  If one is lost, it is easily replaced.  The
              approach is innovative and if adopted on a wide scale will allow libraries to
              move confidently from paper subscriptions to electronic journals in many
              instances. Leading  to dramatic improvements in efficiencies, economics, and
              capabilities of one important aspect of libraries services.
