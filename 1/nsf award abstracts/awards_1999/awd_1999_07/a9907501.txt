Abstract    :
              Gravity waves are believed to affect the atmospheric circulation, temperature,
              and mixing processes at levels ranging from the troposphere through the
              mesosphere and above.  However, they are too small in scale to be resolved in
              general circulation models (GCMs) and must be treated via parameterization. 
              That is, their effects must be described approximately for inclusion in
              large-scale models.  This research program aims to quantify the properties of
              gravity waves and determine their sources, their geographic and seasonal
              variations, and their effects on the atmosphere.  The goal is to improve the
              ways of parameterizing their effects in GCMs.  The approach focuses on analysis
              of observations from the ER-2 stratospheric aircraft to derive information on
              the momentum flux and the temperature perturbations associated with gravity
              waves.  This information is used to define the detailed properties of gravity
              waves and to test theoretical models of wave generation.  Collaboration on
              including gravity wave effects in GCMs is planned with researchers at the NOAA
              Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
