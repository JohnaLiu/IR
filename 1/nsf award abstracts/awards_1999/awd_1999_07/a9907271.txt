This  project  is a theoretical and numerical  investigation
              into  the  coupled  dynamics of the  large-  
and  meso-scale  circulation.The
              theoretical and conceptual work  will  be  based  on  two  sets  of 
coupled
              equations,  the  planetary-  geostrophic (PG) and quasi-geostrophic (QG)
              equations.   The  
first  part  of  the study focuses on the  analysis  of 
              the subpolar gyre circulation in numerical 
solutions of  the  PG  equations
              without any effects of mesocale eddies (uncoupled  from  the  QG  
component).
              Double-gyre wind- and  buoyancy-  forced  solutions  of  the  PG  model  will
              be  
considered,  analyzed in detail, and compared to existing theories of the
              gyre  regimes.  The 
second and third parts of the study will  continue  with
              the analysis of the coupled PG-QG  model  
and  will  focus  on  the
              interaction between the  mesoscale  and  large-scale flows.
