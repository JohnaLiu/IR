Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) operates the
              National Deep Submergence Science Facility in support of marine scientific
              research.  The facility consists of manned and unmanned vehicles.  WHOI 
              requests funds for the upgrade of the umanned Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV),
              including JASON, ARGO and DSL-120.  In the past 5 years the ROVs have supported
              over 25 cruises  in marine geology, chemistry and biology.  These systems have
              also contributed  to the successful deployment of ocean floor observatory
              monitors and various sensors employed to understand the geophysical and
              geotechnical properties of mid-ocean ridges.

Due to rapid changes in
              technology required to support scientific research in the deep ocean,  the
              technology of the rov's must undergo steady technical and operational evolution
              to keep pace with these  requirements.  WHOI, with input from the deep
              submergence science community,  has the necessary engineering capability to
              carry-out the research and development to significantly improve the
              capabilities of the suite of ROVs in the National Facility.  The demand for
              improved support from the vehicles will require the construction of  vehicles
              with greater capability for telemetry,  increased payload, increased 
              maneverability  and  improved sensors  to measure deep submergence parameters. 
              The engineering design will be carried out at WHOI with input from the users
              community.  The project is expected to be completed in two years..
