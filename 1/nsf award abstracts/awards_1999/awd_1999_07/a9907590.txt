Frank Tiller, U. of Houston
Partial travel support for
              academic speakers at the Engineering Foundation Conference on Solid-Liquid
              Separation Systems in Hawaii, April 18-23, 1999, has been requested.  This
              conference will bring together experts from U.S., Latin America, Europe and
              Asia to discuss the most recent developments, make connection between
              theoretical research and industry processing needs, and evaluate future
              research opportunities and trends in the field.   The Conference is co-chaired
              by Prof. Fernando Concha (University of Conception, Chile), Prof. Frank Tiller
              (U. of Houston), and Prof. John Gregory (University College London, U.K.).  
              The focus of the conference will be on emerging technologies involving
              solid-liquid separation systems, and international participation. The
              conference covers a variety of subjects, from flocculation, sedimentation to
              thickening and centrifugation.   The papers presented at the meeting will be
              fully examined and published in the "Separation and Purification Technology"
              journal.
