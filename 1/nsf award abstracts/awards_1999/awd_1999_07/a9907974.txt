Abstract    :
              9907974
The objective of this research is the development and implementation of
              a one-dimensional constitutive theory for solid-solid martensitic phase
              transformations under full and particle cyclic loading. The research shall be
              realized in three specific stages: 1) theoretical constitutive developments: 2)
              numerical implementation and 3) event simulation and modeling. The theoretical
              constitutive stage consist of development of a one-dimensional constitutive
              model for shape memory alloys developed within a phase space formulation after
              Kasper, with the purpose of capturing both the shape memory effect and the
              pseudoelasticity effect. The numerical stage will involve casting the
              constitutive model developed in Stage 1 into a general finite element
              architecture, specifically planar structural elements incorporating both linear
              and nonlinear geometric effects. In addition the issue of algorithmic state
              determination will also be addressed in this stage. Lastly, representative
              simulations will be performed to demonstrate the ability of the formulation to
              capture the essential macroscopic behavior of shape memory alloys.
