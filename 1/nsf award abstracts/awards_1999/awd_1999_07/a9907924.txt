Abstract    :
              This project is a continuation of fundamental studies of radiative transfer in
              clouds composed of nonspherical ice crystals, with specific application to the
              interpretation of radiometric measurements of cirrus clouds from the air and
              space.  It includes an experimental program to measure the spectral reflectance
              and scattering phase function in the visible and near infrared of ice clouds
              generated in a laboratory cold chamber.  The objectives include comparing the
              theoretical scattering properties of ice clouds with the experimental results
              and exploring the information content of scattering measurements that may not
              be available from theory.  On the theoretical side, calculations will be made
              of radiative transfer in clouds of oriented ice crystals, including
              polarization, for comparison with radiometric measurements from the
              Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) and the High
              resolution Interferometer Sounder (HIS) instruments.  Results of this research
              will contribute to understanding the effects of cirrus clouds on the earth's
              radiation budget and to the remote sensing of cloud properties from space and
              the ground.
