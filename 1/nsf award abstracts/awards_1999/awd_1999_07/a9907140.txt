Abstract    :
              This proposal is seeking support for students attending the ACM 1999 Java Grande
              Conference (formerly ACM Workshop  on Java for High-Performance Network
              Computing).  Java and Web technology have become very important for the
              development of new distributed applications and emerging electronic commerce
              systems.  Likewise, we expect Java to play an increasingly important role in
              the broad area of high-performance computing; including engineering and
              scientific computing, simulations, parallel and distributed computing,
              data-intensive applications, and other applications that combine communication
              and computing.  This area of high performance network computing is the focus of
              the conference.  The conference is aimed at getting a broad perspective of
              community interests and views, as well as more technical discussions.  The goal
              is to provide feedback to users and language developers on what is required to
              successfully deploy Java in scientific and high-performance computing
              environments.
