Abstract    :
              This award will support the purchase of new instruments to upgrade and automate
              the sedimentology laboratory at Lamont Doherty.  New equipment includes a
              cabonate coulometer, element analyzer for organic C and N, and particle-size
              analyzer.  A LAN system will be installed so that all researchers have access
              to a common database.
