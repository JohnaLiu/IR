Many ecologists believe that productivity (the rate at which
              energy flows in an ecological system) is one of the most pervasive influences
              on animal and plant diversity. However, very little is known about the
              relationship between productivity and microbial diversity. Recent preliminary
              observations in aquatic mesocosms suggest that bacterial diversity may respond
              to changes in productivity very differently from plant and animal diversity.
              The research conducted under this Postdoctoral Fellowship Starter Grant will
              confirm these preliminary observations and also test whether the pattern
              observed was 1) an artifact of sample size or experimental design, 2) due to
              the different relative scales at which bacterial diversity and plant and animal
              diversity were measured, or 3) due to a fundamentally different relationship
              between productivity and diversity for bacteria. This will be accomplished by
              estimating bacterial diversity in additional mesocosm samples and in samples
              from ponds that vary in productivity, and by repeating the mesocosm experiments
              on a smaller scale and with a broader range of productivity levels.
              Microorganisms represent most of the earth's biodiversity and play a crucial
              role in almost all environmental processes. Understanding how microbial
              diversity is regulated in nature is thus of great importance. This research has
              the potential to generate fundamental new knowledge about the most diverse and
              most abundant organisms on earth.
