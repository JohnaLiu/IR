Description:  This award supports the US-India
              Workshop: Tropical Environmental Problems, which will be held November 1999 at
              the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Laboratory of
              Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palamapur, India.  The five-day workshop will
              bring together 60-80 scientists, students, and postdocs from the United States
              with counterparts from India, the Indian Ocean regions, and Europe.  The
              objectives are to: 1) conduct the first international assessment of the
              completeness and quality of observations and preliminary research results from
              the 1996-1999 Indian Ocean Experiment(INDOEX); 2) depending on assessments and
              early results, identify potentially important future environmental studies
              based on INDOEX and other environmental data sets; and 3) develop proposals for
              joint studies with the new US-India Center for Environmental Research in Delhi.
              On the Indian side this workshop is co-funded by the Council for Scientific and
              Industrial Research.  This workshop is jointly supported by the Division of
              International Programs and the Division of Atmospheric Sciences.          
              

Scope:  This workshop supports the evaluation of results from INDOEX, a US
              initiated project of major importance that addresses fundamental issues
              concerning the environment and climate change.  In addition to scientific
              relevance, the results are important for policy makers actively seeking
              practical solutions to regional and global environmental issues.  This activity
              is consistent with the INT objective to support participation of US post-docs
              and graduate students in international research.  It will also play an
              important role in initiating new collaborations with the recently created
              US-India Center for Environmental Research.
