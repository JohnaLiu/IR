This award supports a planning visit by Professors Charles
              Van Atta and James Rottman, Institute for Pure & Applied Physical Sciences,
              University of California, San Diego, to South Africa in September 1999.  The
              investigators will hold discussions with Professor Derek Stretch and colleagues
              at the University of Natal in Durban on the possibilities for future
              collaborative research on turbulent mixing in stably stratified fluids.  The
              specific topic of interest is how temporal and spatial variations affect the
              structure of turbulence in density stratified flows.  It is expected that
              Professor Stretch will spend some time at UCSD later in the year to perform
              some experiments.  Professor Stretch has considerable expertise in the
              application of Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT).  The Physical Oceanography
              Program of the Division of Ocean Sciences is supporting this planning visit
              along with the Division of International Programs.
