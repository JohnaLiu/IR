Abstract    :
              A consortium will be formed to support a streaming media toolkit and
              applications for high-bandwidth distributed collabortion.  The toolkit and
              applications will be based on the Internet Mbone tools and Mash toolkit that
              are widely used in the research community.  The consortium will manage the
              source code, fix bugs and integrate code developed by the research community,
              establish standards, create documentation and training material, manage the web
              site and by-weekly distributed video conferences, organize working groups, and
              generally act as as focus for continued development of the toolkit and
              applications.  A high-quality lecture archive will be established and
              procedures defined that will allow other research organizations and individuals
              to develop content,  contribute lectures to the archive, and establish their
              own archives.
