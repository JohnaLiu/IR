Menon
A novel approach to the fabrication of stable nanoscale silicon
              carbide hetero-fullerene polymers is proposed which, if realized, will have
              important industrial applications. It is based on the recent experimental
              report on successful synthesis of silicon doped hetero-fullerenes.

The
              theoretical methods involve simulations using state-of-the-art transferable
              quantum tight-binding molecular dynamics scheme that can be used to accurately
              treat complex hetero-atomic interactions. Simulation results can be used as a
              guide in the experimen-tal investigations.

Calculations of the infrared and
              Raman active mode frequencies of the dimer will be carried out to aid in the
              experimental search for Si-coupled fullerene
              polymers.
