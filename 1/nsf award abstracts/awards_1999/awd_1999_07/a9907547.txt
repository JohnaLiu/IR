Abstract    :
              OCE 99-07547

This project was proposed to several US agencies for collective
              review and decision. Funds will be used to provide an assessment of the
              potential climate and global change impacts in the Pacific Island region. It
              comprises one regional component of the ongoing U.S. National Assessment. The
              proposal focuses on water resources, extreme events, and climate-related
              coastal hazards. It proposes to develop the infrastructure needed to enhance
              community interaction and provide outreach to impacted stakeholders in the
              region. The results will contribute to the National Assessment and should
              provide additional regional information for use in identifying actions which
              requiring decision. It should also suggest additional research activities
              needed in support of regional assessments.
