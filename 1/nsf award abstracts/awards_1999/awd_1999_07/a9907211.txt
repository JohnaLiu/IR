Abstract    :
              This grant provides for the archival of single channel and multichannel seismic
              data collected by investigators at Scripps.  At present much of the data re
              stored on 9-track tapes that will not remain reliable for much longer.  The
              data will be migrated to the IGPP digital archive and will be placed on line in
              this archive.  They will be available to users inside and outside Scripps via
              aWWW interface.
