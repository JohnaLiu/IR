CAPTURE REGIONS FOR GRASPING,
              MANIPULATING AND RE-ORIENTING PARTS

This is the first year of a three-year
              continuing award. The PI addresses the problem of manipulating an object using
              a succession of contacts with simple robotic devices that may have discrete or
              continuous degrees of freedom. The problem of planning the overall object
              trajectory is reduced to constructing a sequence of atomic robot motions
              between equilibrium states of the system.  The proposed approach is based on
              constructing the capture region of each equilibrium, i.e., the maximal subset
              of the object's configuration
space such that any motion starting within this
              subset is guaranteed to end up in the equilibrium configuration. In particular,
              contact is not assumed to maintain during the execution of the manipulation
              task; nor is there any attempt to predict the object motion between equilibria.
              This approach will be applied to three problems: (1) grasping and in-hand
              manipulation in the presence of frictional effects and large position
              uncertainties, (2) motion planning for mobile robots pushing an object while
              avoiding obstacles, and (3) re-orienting parts by dropping them on a simple
              mechanism reminiscent of Pachinko machines. Progress will be assessed by
              conducting experiments with actual robotic devices, including four Nomadic
              Super Scout II mobile robots and prototypes of the reconfigurable gripper and
              of the proposed Pachinko machine developed at the University of Illinois. The
              main applications of the proposed research are in manufacturing, including part
              feeding and industrial assembly. Longer-term applications include the control
              of teams of domestic robots as they perform chores around a house.
