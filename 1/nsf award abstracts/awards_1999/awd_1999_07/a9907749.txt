              ABSTRACT
EEC-9907749
JOHNSON

Increasing the efficiency of automobile
              engines while maintaining or reducing their hazardous emissions entails raising
              their operating temperature.  One of the main barriers to raising the operating
              temperature, is the capability of relatively cheap and reliable electrical
              circuitry to operate at the additional 30 degrees.

A planning grant
              EEC-9902096 was awarded to Auburn University to determine the feasibility and
              viability of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Advanced
              Vehicle Electronics.  The Center's research agenda is:  

1. Flip Chip on
              Laminate
2. Development of Lead-Free Soldier Alloys
3. High Temperature
              Electronics
4. High Density Connectors
5. Ball Grid Array Reliability
