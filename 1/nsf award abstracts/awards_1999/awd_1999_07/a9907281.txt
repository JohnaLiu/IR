Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop soluble complexes of DNA with
              cationic polymers for use in gene delivery to cells.  The objectives described
              in the proposal are threefold:  (1) to examine the efficacy of gene transfer of
              DNA/polycation complexes of various molecular architectures; (2) to study
              cellular mechanisms for delivery of the complexes into the cell; and (3) to
              evaluate the efficacy of gene transfer of DNA/polycation complexes containing
              attached proteins and peptides.
