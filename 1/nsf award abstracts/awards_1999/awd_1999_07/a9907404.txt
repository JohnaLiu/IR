Abstract    :
              Paulson 9907404

Upper ocean data collected during the Coupled Ocean
              Atmosphere Response 
Experiment (COARE) in the western tropical Pacific will
              analyzed in combination 
with large eddy simulations (LES) to understand the
              dynamical processes which 
govern the evolution of fresh water lenses formed
              by rainfall. In addition to 
comparisons with the observed case studies, the
              LES model will forced with 
idealized forcing to extend the experimental
              results to a full range of forcing 
conditions. The cases studies and the LES
              simulations will also be compared 
with ocean mixing parameterizations such as
              the Mellor_Yamada second order 
turbulence closure, the Price-Weller-Pinkel
              mixed layer model and the K-profile 
parameterization based on a model of the
              atmospheric boundary layer.
