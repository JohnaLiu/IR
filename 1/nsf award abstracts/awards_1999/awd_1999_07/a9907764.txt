This award supports a planning process for a peer reviewed
              online Journal of Earth System Science Education (JESSE) for the purpose of
              creating a common repository of quality Earth system science education
              resources for undergraduate and graduate classroom instruction.  JESSE peer
              review will offer to the authors of these materials the recognition deserved
              for their commitment to education, and may assist in institutional reward and
              tenure decisions.  An editorial/advisory board has been established to refine
              and implement the review process and establish review criteria, including
              content accuracy, pedagogical effectiveness and presentation format/ease of
              use.  An innovative and open peer review process will be implemented,
              encouraging reviewer-developer communication, with provision for confidential
              exchange.  Final reviewer attribution will be on open record to optimize
              commentary and exchange among authors and users. JESSE will draw upon the
              experience of the ongoing ESSE network of institutions, and will work in close
              coordination with the proposed Geoscience Digital Library (GDL).  JESSE will
              also work in close coordination with the Columbia University Press Columbia
              Earthscape project, and interactive library resource on the global environment
              also under development.  JESSE aims to develop a common review mechanism for
              each of these efforts.
