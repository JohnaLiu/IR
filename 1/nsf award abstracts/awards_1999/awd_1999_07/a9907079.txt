Abstract    :
              Magmatism and mantle convection at subduction zones and island arcs are some of
              the principal processes affecting the geochemical and physical evolution of our
              planet. The purpose of the proposed work is to develop a set of quantitative
              computer models that can relate these processes at depth to observations
              available at the surface, particularly the composition and volume of volatiles
              and magmas that erupt at island arcs. This requires developing codes that can
              consistently solve for reactive magma-transport in a deforming convecting
              mantle.  Based on an extensive set of models designed for melting at mid-ocean
              ridges these new codes will be extended to include the impact of volatiles on
              melting at island arcs.  Both sets of models will provide a consistent
              framework for investigating the coupled geophysical/geochemical dynamics of the
              Earth's mantle.
