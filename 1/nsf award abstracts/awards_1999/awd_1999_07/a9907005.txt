Abstract    :
              This project will analyze 15N in bulk sediments and diatom frustules from ODP
              cores in the North Pacific spanning the last 6 million years.  The data will
              test the hypothesis that establishment of a strong halocline in the middle
              Pliocene resulted in a drastic reduction of Productivity across the subarctic
              North Pacific gyre.  Reduced primary production over this large an area may
              have contributed to a global reduction in atmospheric CO2, which in turn may
              have been a contributory cause of the intensification of northern hemisphere
              glaciation.
