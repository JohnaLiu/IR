This U.S.-Brazil award supports a planning visit by Dr.
              Daniel R. Farkas, CPI, to meet with Dr. Eduardo Marcos at the University of Sao
              Paulo, Brazil to develop a collaborative research project concerning the
              exploration of derivations of finite-dimensional algebras. The interplay
              between the structure of an algebra and its symmetries will be emphasized.
              

The collaborators intend to use Hochschild cohomology and representation
              theory of path algebras to extend them to higher derivations in order to
              understand the automorphism group of finite-dimensional algebras. 
              Additionally, they will explore collaboration with computational specialists at
              both universities, thereby encouraging stronger ties between the two
              institutions.
