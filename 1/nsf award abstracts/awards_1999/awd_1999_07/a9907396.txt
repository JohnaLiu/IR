Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to purchase equipment and instrumentation that will
              form the basis for a new experimental facility for investigating the science of
              neural prosthetic arms at the Engineering Research Center for Neuromorphic
              Engineering at the California Institute of Technology.  The equipment is being
              used in research to investigate how the cerebral cortex plans reaching-arms
              movements.  The goal is to understand the underlying neurobiology of the
              sensory-motor interface where plans first form.  This understanding is the
              basis for cortically controlled prosthetic devices.  The equipment will enable
              exploration of how parietal reach region neurons in the posterior parietal
              cortex plan real and virtual arm movements by recording electrical activity
              from many neurons simultaneously (using an implanted multi-electrode array)
              while monkeys reach to remembered visual targets.  The electrical signals will
              then be used to drive a virtual arm in a computer model/simulation.  The
              understanding of how the neurons work to move the arm will be the basis for
              control of a real prosthetic arm.
