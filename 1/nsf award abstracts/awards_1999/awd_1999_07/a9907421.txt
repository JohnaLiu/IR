Abstract    :
              Smith 9907421

Immigration has a major impact on American society. 
              Immigration now accounts for one-third of U.S. population growth, and the U.S.
              takes in more immigrants than all other countries combines-and immigration
              policy continue to be the subject of much political and scientific debate. Yet,
              there is a large gap between information needs and existing data.  In it more
              than 200-year history the U.S. has never had a nationally representative survey
              of immigrants and their children.    To remedy this, the investigators had
              designed The New Immigrant Survey (NIS).  The NIS has a
              prospective-retrospective design in which large (N=11,000) probability samples
              are drawn from new cohorts of legal permanent resident aliens, using the
              administrative records of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  Sampled
              immigrants will be interviewed immediately after admission to permanent
              resident status and re-interviewed periodically thereafter; information will be
              obtained about and from their children, both the immigrant children they
              brought with them and the U.S. citizen children born to them in the United
              States.

The project is being jointly funded by several Federal agencies
              (i.e., National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National
              Institute on Aging, and the Department of Health and Human Services).  The
              support from NSF will primarily support the collection of detailed information
              about immigrant American scientists.  While, it is well known that immigrants
              supply a significant part of the skilled high technology human resources for
              the country, much less is known about their specific skills, how these
              translate into the American labor market and how well immigrants with high
              level scientific training do over time.  Data will be collected on immigrants
              schooling histories, including field of degree, and all work related scientific
              experiences both abroad and in the United States, and the experiences of
              immigrant scientists over time.
