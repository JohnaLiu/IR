Abstract    :
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program support of this research project will
              enable the further development of near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM)
              for the study of organic thin films.  Professor Barbara and his students at the
              the University of Texas at Austin will study the mesoscopic structure of
              important non-linear optically active materials, and other organic thin film
              materials. The connection between mesoscopic structure and electronic and
              optical properties of these materials will be determined, with wide ranging
              applications to the development of optoelectronic materials resulting from this
              work.

The connection between the mesoscale structure and the function of
              organic thin film materials is very poorly understood, primarily because of the
              lack of methods available for the determination of the structure of these
              materials on this scale.  The development of a method for this structural
              characterization is the focus of this research project.  Near field scanning
              optical microscopy in the fluorescence detection mode will be developed and
              applied to the study of a range of organic thin film materials with
              applications in optoelectronic device design.
