This project is designed to salvage survey a very rich
              fossil site in Argentina, theGran Barranca.  This locality is the single most
              important fossil mammal site and Cenozoic faunal sequence in all of South
              America, and at the Gran Barranca occur several of the richest Cenozoic fossil
              vertebrate sites in the continent.  Recent exploration activities by petroleum
              companies have placed the important scientific resources at Gran Barranca in
              jeopardy.  The investigators propose to mitigate the damage already done by
              making much larger and more intensive salvage collecitons in the damaged areas,
              and to undertake a more thorough survey of the region.  The survey will recover
              new fossil mammal specimens, and produce base and survey maps to be used for
              scientific research and for exploration management by the local enterprises. 
              This project is supported under the guidelines of the Small Grants for
              Exploratory Research (SGER) program.
