This project is developing a series of innovative classroom
              instructional materials for the large-enrollment, introductory science survey
              course for non-science and pre-service education majors.  The final materials
              package, called Lecture-Tutorials, is a self-contained, classroom-ready product
              for use with collaborative student learning groups.  The materials are designed
              specifically to be easily integrated into the conventional lecture course.  As
              such, this product directly addresses the needs of busy researchers and heavily
              loaded teaching faculty for effective, student-centered, classroom-ready
              materials that do not require a drastic course revision for implementation. 
              The Lecture-Tutorials developed for this project are based upon educational
              research on student misconceptions, demonstrated effective instructional
              strategies, and extensive pilot and field-testing.  The materials-development
              procedure serves as a national model for other science disciplines that provide
              similar large-enrollment introductory courses.  The project investigators are
              primarily disseminating these materials through workshops at professional
              science meetings in addition to making print and Web versions readily
              available.
