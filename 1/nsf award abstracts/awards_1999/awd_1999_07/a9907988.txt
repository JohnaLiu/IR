Osswald
This award supports Tim Osswald and students from the
              University of Wisconsin--Madison in a collaboration with Gottfried Ehrenstein
              of the Department of Materials Research at the University of
              Erlangen-Nuremburg, Germany.  The project will focus on the mechanical and
              rheological properties of thermosetting polymers during cure.  Current models
              use assumptions that work well only for predicting the thermomechanical
              behavior of thin parts, but do not work well for thick parts, such as those
              containing ribs or reinforcing structures.  The collaboration funded here will
              model, analyze, and simulate the thermomechanical behavior of thermoset
              composite parts.  Besides advancing the scientific knowledge in this important
              area, the results of the collaboration could have implications for industry by
              developing new materials to save cost, reduce weight, and conserve natural
              resources.
