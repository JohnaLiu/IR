The Gordon Research Conference on Solid State Chemistry will be
              held in Queens College, Oxford, England September 19 - September 23, 1999.  The
              goal of the conference is to facilitate interdisciplinary interactions and
              information exchange within a broad spectrum of researchers with interest in
              solid state chemistry.  The NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of
              young American Scientists.

Solid  State Chemistry continues to have
              direct impact on the technological advances to our society by designing new
              materials such as porous solids for catalysis or thin films for electronics.
