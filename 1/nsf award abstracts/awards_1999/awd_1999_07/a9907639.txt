Abstract    :
              This is a RIDGE Post-Doctoral Research Grant.  The research program will
              approach the question of the geochemical fluxes between magmatic and
              hydrothermal systems on mid-ocean ridges.  The work is focused on the
              measurement of trace element contents of mid-ocean ridge basalt glasses, Os
              isotopes in oliving phenocrysts, and the study of melt inclusions in selected
              mid-ocean ridge basalts.  The primary aim is to evaluate how interaciton with
              hydrothermal materials influences the geochemistry of mid-ocean ridge basalts.
