Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a workshop to bring together US and Mexican
              computer and information science researchers and librarians at the University
              of New Mexico.  The goal is to share information and knowledge and develop a
              template for creating large-scale digital libraries initiatives, and to develop
              a case study from the template focused on a Mexican Digital Library Project
              that will enhance current practices in Mexico and link to existing projects in
              the US and other coutries.
