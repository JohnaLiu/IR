Leinbach
This award supports a planning visit to Finland for the PI,
              Thomas Leinbach, and the co-PI Stanley Brunn.  The funding will allow the PI
              and co-PI to meet with Finnish scholars in Helsinki, Turku, and Joensuu to
              discuss the development of a collaborative proposal on regional and
              international competitive strategies.  This is an area of general importance
              because the globalization of production has created a new international
              division of labor and has significantly intensified competition.  By
              concentrating on the single Finnish firm NOKIA, the planned research will
              investigate the cultural aspects that account for the growth and success of the
              firm.  The purpose of the visit is to engage scholars in varying disciplines
              that share the PI's interests, and then to produce a long-term research plan.
