Abstract    :
              The PIs will expand their previous study of the subsidence rates in a
              co1lisional setting in the Huon Gulf of Papua New Guinea.  The new study will
              provide tighter constraints on the short term subsidence rates, and lead to a
              better understanding of the relationships between uplift, subsidence and
              convergence in a collisional setting, as well as better chronology for
              sea-level changes for the last 400 k. years.  The PIs will obtain bathymetric
              images of the drowned coral platforms first with the SeaBeam and later with
              DSL120 with a resolution of several meters.  The reefs will be sampled with an
              ROV system to obtain Th230 dates.  Observed rates of subsidence will be
              compared to model elastic flexural response to collisional loads.
