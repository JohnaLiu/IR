AFM -assisted, Nanometer-scale
              Modification of Semiconductor Chips

The goal of this Engineering
              Microsystems: "XYZ" on a Chip project is to develop a new technique for writing
              on a very small scale (nanolithography), and to apply nanolithography to the
              construction of a cell membrane on an electrode.  Enzymes are mounted on the
              working tip of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) force sensor and the enzymes
              are used to perform a specific chemical reaction at a specific location
              dictated by the microscope.  The initial objectives are to attach enzymes to
              the tips while maintaining chemical reactivity, and to synthesize a surface
              film that is easily modified by the enzyme.  An AFM is also used to verify the
              accuracy of the writing process.  To protect the delicate enzyme-tip, an AFM
              that has two separate probes is being developed.  One probe is for writing and
              one is for reading in the same location.  The enzyme-assisted nanolithographic
              technique will be used to fabricate a cell membrane on a semiconductor chip. 
              The natural cell scaffold that supports the cell membrane will be attached to
              the chip by using the AFM enzyme tip to perform reactions at specific
              locations.
The development of writing techniques with high spatial and
              chemical specificity enhances our ability to manufacture miniaturize electronic
              components and to perform parallel drug screening.  The development of a
              realistic chip-mounted membrane is a key step in the preparation of
              biosensors.
