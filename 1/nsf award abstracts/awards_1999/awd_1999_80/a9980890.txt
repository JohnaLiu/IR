Abstract    :
              Physics (13) This project is creating a curriculum that will enhance students'
              first year physics experience and pave the way for a more vital discovery-based
              program in the advanced courses and the major. It  will thus increase the
              interest and expertise of women in physics and technology.

The project will
              adapt and implement computer and technology based laboratories and exercises
              into the introductory physics curriculum, including Workshop Physics and
              Just-in-Time Teaching. The curricular adaptations will include discovery-based,
              active learning techniques. Computer-interfaced experiments allow for the
              experimenter to reduce the number of tedious or cookbook tasks, and allow for
              her to have a more visual, complete view of the data at hand. The World Wide
              Web will be used extensively for interactive exercises (physlets) and for Just
              in Time Teaching techniques. The Web allows the student to carry out
              interactive; visual exercises and allows for almost instantaneous interaction
              among students or between the students and professor.
