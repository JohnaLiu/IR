Researchers from the University of Alaska and Goddard
              Space Flight Center (NASA) propose to study in detail the ongoing effects of
              the 1964 Alaska earthquake on the Kenai Peninsula and adjacent areas of
              southern Alaska. Previous work has shown evidence for substantial spatial
              variations in the contemporary (1993-1998) deformation, the cumulative
              postseismic and coseismic deformation. New data that will significantly improve
              our knowledge of the slip distributions responsible for the coseismic,
              postseismic and interseismic deformation will be collected and modeled. The
              proposed work is an advance over past work in several respects: (1) it will use
              recently uncovered historical data that will greatly improve the 1964 
              coseismic data set; (2) it will use improved modeling techniques  rather than
              relying on coseismic displacements computed in the 1960s; 3) it will collect
              new data to constrain the cumulative postseismic  and contemporary deformation;
              (4) a consistent and realistic  geometric model will be used for all phases of
              the deformation,  instead of different geometric models being used to study
              different  phases of the deformation.
