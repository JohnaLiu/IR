Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)  A management model borrowing features of the
              Louisiana Collaborative for Excellence in the Preparation of Teachers (LaCEPT)
              will be adapted to a departmental scale and is being used to promote the reform
              of the LSU mathematics course M1100. The LaCEPT model is based on a philosophy
              of 'reform form the bottom up, lateral assistance and support from the top
              down.' It drives reform by providing instructors with information, supporting
              individual creativity, promoting collaboration, creating buy in, and drawing on
              the knowledge distributed throughout the organization. The course M 1100 is a
              required part of the K-8 teacher education program and is taken by about 200
              future teachers every year, together with an additional 400 to 500 students
              fulfilling quantitative literacy requirements. It is presently the only
              mathematics course where future K-8 teachers at LSU encounter probability and
              statistics.  The content areas for the course include the language of
              mathematics, probability, statistics, and financial mathematics.
