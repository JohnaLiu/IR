The objective of this proposal is to
              develop metal ion exchange zeolite catalytic systems with enhanced performance
              for lean NOx  engines.  Emissions control for these types of engines suffer
              from the lack of a durable, active catalyst, which can operate in oxidizing
              exhaust.  This project is a collaboration between LSU and General Motors.  Most
              of the zeolite synthesis will be carried out at LSU, and GM will test the
              reactivity and investigate the reaction kinetics.  Better understanding of
              methods of making SUZ-4 type zeolites for stability will be pursued. The most
              widely studied and promising NOx catalytic system uses an aluminum containing
              zeolite (MFI) with an ion-exchanged metal deposited on the acid sites within
              the zeolite pores.  In preliminary work copper-loaded zeolite yielded
              relatively high activity for NOx decomposition.  This work will be continued,
              and kinetic studies will be carried out.  If successful, this project will
              assist in the development of a catalyst that will solve one of the main sources
              of atmospheric pollution, the emission of NOx by automotive sources.
