Abstract    :
              This project will fund the planning conference for a larger meeting to create a
              long term public national agenda for incorporating, new ideas of complexity,
              dynamical systems modeling of nonlinear phenomena  and related ideas such as
              emergence and fractal descriptions into the mainstream educational experience
              of American citizens.  An invitational planning meeting will be held near
              Boston, the final and second, a public conference in Washington, DC in late
              autumn of 1999.  This proposal is to fund the planning meeting and provide the
              conceptual foundations and practical information to define the second.  Our
              planning necessarily involves distinct communities of scholars, scientists and
              educators who bring diverse experiences, insights and perspectives to our large
              task.  The outcome of the first meeting will be a series of working papers and
              summaries of prior work and web site that will be the basis for the major
              public conference and the associated national agenda.
