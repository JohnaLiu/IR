CRCD:  An Open and Integrated Platform for Online Laboratory
              Experiment, Computer Simulation and Course Instruction Using Internet

This
              CISE Combined Research-Curriculum Develop proposal requests funds to develop an
              open and integrated platform for online laboratory experimentation, computer
              simulation, and course instruction using the Internet for research and teaching
              in modeling, analysis, and control of dynamic systems.  The open and integrated
              architecture will allow faculty and students around the nation to develop,
              implement and conduct their own lab and computer projects.  The project will be
              a joint effort by the University of Arizona (UA), Arizona State University
              (ASU) and Northern Arizona University (NAU).  The proposed platform will have a
              direct and significant impact on the teaching of approximately sixty existing
              courses at the three universities.  Some of these courses do not currently have
              a lab component; others need to be updated and improved.  The proposed platform
              will be integral to the creation of two new courses for advanced undergraduate
              and beginning graduate students: Mechatronics and Intelligent Control
              Systems.
