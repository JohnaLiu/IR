Developing a Prototype National Digital
              Library for Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology Education 

This
              is a standard award.  The project develops a prototype for a national digital
              library for Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology Education (SMETE).
               It is to be a national resource that goes beyond a traditional academic
              library in digital form.  It is to be a digital learning space, serving a
              community of SMETE learners that encompasses faculty, students, and lifelong
              learners.  This project builds on previous grants that developed the prototype
              for a National Engineering Education Delivery System (NEEDS).  NEEDS will be
              the operational testbed for an expanded gateway to SMETE collections and
              content.   

A series of focus groups is being held to define user needs, and
              a set of partnerships are being established with other national digital
              projects to extend the NEEDS testbed across multiple disciplines.  The goals of
              the project are:   1) to develop a model for assessing and defining user needs
              and use that model to define the system specifications,  2) to facilitate
              interaction between users of the content and collections, and 3) to build an
              interdisciplinary bridge across existing disciplinary communities.
