The investigator and his collaborators propose to study some
              problems in analytic number theory.  Specifically, they seek to prove an
              asymptotic formula for the large sieve inequality; this would have 
              applications to small gaps between zeros of Dirichlet L-functions and to  mean
              value formulae for sixth and eighth moments of Dirichlet L-functions.  Further,
              they want to show that there are infinitely many Dirichlet L-functions
              associated with real primitive characters that have no positive real zeros. 
              This assertion is not known to hold for any infinite family of L-functions. 
              Also, they will investigate the Balazard-Saias criterion for the Riemann
              Hypothesis.  For example, is this criterion equivalent to the Riemann
              Hypothesis? 

Number theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with
              problems  involving whole numbers.  Applications of number theory to coding, 
              networking, data compression, and cryptography have thrust number theory into
              the forefront of modern mathematics. L-functions provide an important tool for
              investigating many questions of number theory, yet our understanding of the
              fundamental properties of L-functions is incomplete.  The investigator and his
              collaborators seek to fill in some of the gaps in our basic knowledge of
              L-functions.
