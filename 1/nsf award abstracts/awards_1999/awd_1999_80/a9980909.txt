Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) The Protein Explorer features discovery-based,
              interactive learning with built-in quizzing. There are three levels of
              presentation: basic, an introduction to the principles of protein structure;
              guided, an intermediary level offering a dozen built-in molecules; and
              advanced. Guided Protein Explorer leads the student through a series of
              fundamental questions, automatically rendering the molecule in the best manner
              for observing the answer to each question, while quizzing the student. It also
              enables students to use the same series of questions to explore any of the
              10,000 macromolecules available from the Protein Data Bank To assist in
              interpreting the images of an unknown molecule, built-in molecules which
              illustrate major categories (e.g. soluble vs. lipid-seeking) are offered for
              comparison. As an advance over the existing software (RasMol and Chime) serving
              as a base for this product, no specialized technical knowledge of the software
              is required to use the basic or guided forms. Protein Explorer is freely
              downloadable from an educational macromolecular visualization website,
              www.rcsb.org, currently visited by 5,000-6,000 people per week.
