Abstract:


The
              need for high speed data transmission has motivated the desire to
utilize the
              full capacity of optical fibers.  The fiber optic channel
holds the potential
              for information transfer orders of magnitude faster
(in bits per second) than
              is currently exploited.  Signal degradation
through the fiber channel is a key
              problem in accomplishing high
capacity, especially in long-haul links
              (transcontinental or
transoceanic) and large networks.  This research explores
              pre- and
post-fiber coding and signal processing possible to reduce the effect
              of
channel degradation.  Mastering these physical limitations of the
              fiber
medium can translate into a tremendous increase in the capacity
              of
existing infrastructure.

This research addresses the design and
              optimization of multi-channel
wavelength division multiplexed (WDM)
              fiber-optic systems.  Multiuser
systems are typically broadband and high
              power, sometimes leading to
severe linear and nonlinear degradation in the
              signal due to properties
inherent to the fiber.  The approach taken is a
              communications theoretic
approach, considering signal constellation, coding,
              channel
equalization, and joint signal detection.  The research is to
              be
performed in three phases.  The first is to identify best and
              worst
time/wavelength sequences for WDM.  Effective jointly optimal
              line-codes
for WDM systems will then be designed.  The research will conclude
              with
a study of nonlinear equalization methods for crosstalk
              cancellation.
The tools used for optimization and system performance analysis
              are
input/output descriptions of the fiber nonlinearity and
              system
simulation.
