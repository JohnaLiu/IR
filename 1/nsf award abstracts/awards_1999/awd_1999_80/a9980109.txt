Abstract    :
              This research will identify the factors that lead to the formation, maintenance
              and dissolution of dynamically linked knowledge networks.  Two core research
              questions will be addressed:  How do diverse knowledge networks co-evolve over
              time and at multiple levels?  How do the centrality, density, diffusion and
              other properties of knowledge networks at each level affect task performance by
              individuals, groups and organizations?   The PIs plan to adopt a broad, generic
              approach to understanding the co-evolution of knowledge networks.  Knowledge
              networks may share important common structural properties across levels, or may
              develop in similar ways.  Where that proves to be true, theories at one level
              can be expanded to apply to networks at several levels;  where network
              properties diverge, existing theories will be modified and new ones developed. 
              The theory generated by this research, the computational models tested and the
              statistical techniques developed will have important scientific implications
              beyond the substantive research findings of this project;  they will be
              applicable to human networks in other contexts as well as to a variety of
              knowledge and network issues in society, and will also significantly enhance
              future statistical analysis of many forms of networks.
