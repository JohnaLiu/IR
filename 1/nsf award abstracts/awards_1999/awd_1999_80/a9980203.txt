Abstract    :
              This proposal is for creation of a distributed storage network testbed. The goal
              is to improve the performance of network based storage by deploying "logistical
              networking" facilities as uniform network services. Although such services as
              caches and buffers are familiar in networked information systems, but they are
              not explicitly modeled in the standard protocol stack and middleware of the
              Internet. The special case investigated here is replication of services which
              uses the Internet2 Distributed Storage Infrastructure as its experimental
              facility. To explore the more general case the Internet Backplane Protocol
              (IBP), developed by the PIs, is used for co-scheduling networking and storage
              resources. The plan is to develop and deploy basic functionality to the point
              where it is scalable and manageable to support a real application community.
              Prototype applications of IBP in early development include middleware for state
              management in 
Computational Grids, IBP-MIME to enable movement of very large
              files via email, and IBP memory servers for distributed sensory data.
