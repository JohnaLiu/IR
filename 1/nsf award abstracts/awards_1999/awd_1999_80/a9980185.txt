Abstract    :
              This project will develop an operational digital library of small
              platform-independent electronic tools (e.g. applets) for teaching and learning
              mathematics.  The performers define three primary tasks:  1) to locate and
              
collect applets and similar programs developed by the mathematics research
              and teaching communities from the web and sources; 2) to review and test these
              systematically, and 3) to make them easily accessible to faculty and students. 
               While the focus of the project is on college-level material, it is recognized
              that many 
mathematical ideas span and are integral to formal and informal
              education at all levels.  In particular, the resulting library of the project
              is also expected to be useful to secondary school teachers and students. 
              Extensible design of the library will allow expansion and growth of the
              resource in terms of functionality and content-type and scale.
