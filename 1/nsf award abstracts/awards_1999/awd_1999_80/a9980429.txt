Abstract    :
              Abstract:

High speed, high volume cryptographic systems will
form the basis
              for the security of video, wireless,
and computer communications of the next
              decade.  This
research involves the design and development of such
systems,
              especially that of hardware-based stream
ciphers.  High speed hardware-based
              stream ciphers can
be easily manufactured, programmed, and implemented.
They
              can be used to encrypt data (such as voice or
video) in real time and are used
              as embedded
components in cellular telephones, GPS satellites,
radar, and
              radio systems.  Most stream ciphers,
however, have been found to be vulnerable
              to various
cryptoanalytic attacks.  This research involves the
development
              and analysis of new architectures for
sequence generators which have all the
              above
advantages but which are much more secure than
traditional
              architectures.  They are also potentially
useful for a variety of other
              applications such as
sonar systems and Monte Carlo integration.

Linear
              feedback shift registers have proven especially
useful for the generation of
              pseudorandom sequences
for high speed communications.  They have
              been
intensively studied for over forty years and their
usefulness does not
              appear to have any end in sight.
Recently a fundamentally new architecture for
              feedback
shift registers was discovered, the so-called
feedback-with-carry
              shift register or FCSR.  This
architecture shares all the advantages of the
              linear
feedback architecture such as high speed and ease of
implementation
              and significantly expands the class of
easily generated and useful sequences. 
              This research
involves a number of implementation issues for the
              new
architecture including (1) the development of parallel
circuitry for high
              speed generation of pseudorandom
sequences, (2) the design of combiners and
              feedforward
functions to increase the security of FCSR sequences, 
(3) the
              design of clock-controlled FCSR circuits, and 
(4) the analysis of the
              cryptographic security of the 
FCSR sequences which are generated in this way.
