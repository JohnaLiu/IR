This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration involves
              Bernard Doudin and David Sellmyer from the University of Nebraska and Wolfgang
              Wernsdorfer of the Louis Neel Magnet Laboratory in Grenoble, France.  The
              investigators propose to investigate the magnetic properties of individual
              ferromagnets with control morphology in the sub-100 nanometer dimension range
              using ultra-sensitive magnetic measurements at low temperatures.  Experiments
              will be performed on magnetic needles where the shape controls the
              magnetization reversal mechanism.  Slow-dynamic measurements will also be
              performed.  The objective is to characterize the barrier energy and the
              mechanism of magnetization hopping over this barrier.   The Nebraska group
              brings to this collaboration unique expertise in nanoscale magnetism, hard
              ferromagnetism, synthesis, and magnetic recording media.  This is complemented
              by the theoretical expertise of the French group on quantum effects in
              magnetization reversal.  It also provides access to a unique magnetometer
              developed by the French investigator, which uses micro SQUIDS to measure the
              magnetization reversal of magnets.

This award represents the U.S. side of a
              joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the U.S.
              investigator.  The CNRS will support the visits of the French researchers to
              the United States. The collaboration will advance understanding of quantum
              mechanical properties of magnets and the approach for tailoring sample
              properties for application in magnetic recording media.
