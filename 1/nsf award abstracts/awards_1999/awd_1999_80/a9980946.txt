Abstract    :
              Astronomy (11) The project is adapting a telescope used by a few other
              institutions for undergraduates, a 60-cm (24-inch) computer-controlled
              telescope with a sensitive 1024 x l024-pixel CCD camera, to improve
              dramatically the college's astronomical imaging capabilities, increasing the
              number and quality of student projects. The camera, combined with existing
              instrumentation (a slit spectrograph, a fiber fed spectrograph, and an aperture
              photometer) form a flexible and powerful suite of modern instrumentation for
              observational astrophysics. Projects range from variations of standard
              astronomy observations to work adapted from the research literature to student
              research projects. The overall goal of the project is to exploit the reservoir
              of public interest in astronomy to increase the number of students who develop
              an understanding of and appreciation for science, whether as educated citizens
              or as career scientists. The new equipment supports several new undergraduate
              courses in astrophysics, as well as improving the laboratory for the popular
              introductory astronomy course. The equipment also supports independent research
              projects by science majors, workshops for local science teachers, and visits by
              the general public.
