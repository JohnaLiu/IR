Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Iowa State University, under the direction of Dr.
              David Jiles, for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development
              project entitled, " Vertically Integrated Engineering Design for Combined
              Research and Curriculum Development."  This project focuses on a combination of
              design experience and research to meet the educational needs of future
              generations of engineers in the most efficient manner possible and without
              increasing the number of course credits needed for graduation.  The mechanism
              devised for achieving this is termed "vertically integrated design," which will
              provide a broader design experience for engineering students.  This approach
              will engage students throughout their undergraduate career, beginning with
              sophomores, using state-of-the-art engineering simulators that illustrate the
              various critical stages in the life cycle of manufactured components.  The
              specific field of research involved is nondestructive evaluation, which
              combines recent advances in life-cycle engineering, modeling and strong
              industrial interactions through the NSF Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Nondestructive Evaluation.  Formal courses on engineering
              practice and design will be taught in parallel with the experimental research
              project, which will involve sophomores, juniors and seniors working together.
