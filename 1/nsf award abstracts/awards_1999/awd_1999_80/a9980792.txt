Abstract    :
              This project will study interactions between three distinct systems: (1)
              photovoltaic molecules and/or membrane structures derived from green plants and
              artificial photosynthetic systems, (2) micron-scale electrode arrays formed by
              metal wires in microchannel glass, and (3) the retina. The proposed research
              will provide a knowledge and technology base necessary to integrate these
              systems towards the successful development of a novel, energy-efficient retinal
              prosthesis with a micron scale spatial resolution. More specifically, these 
              objectives will be pursued:
   - Investigate  interactions between natural and
              artificial photoactive structures and microchannel glass         electrode
              arrays and to determine methods of attaching the structures to individual
              microwires.
   - Develop methods for depositing conductors throughout the
              entire length of the microchannels.
   - Determine the optimal size and shape
              for a retinal stimulating electrode.
   - Test the biocompatibility of the
              microchannel glass and photoactivated microchannel glass.
Results of this
              research are likely  to have broader application through improved understanding
              of metal/molecular interfaces, imaging technology, novel microfabrication
              techniques, and biological interfacing and testing.
