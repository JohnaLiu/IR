Abstract    :
              This proposal is aimed at developing a general framework for source address
              validation across the Internet and investigating issues in realizing the source
              validation deployment. Result of this work will help in stopping malicious
              attacks such as denial of service' attack. The work includes enhancements to
              the current network routing protocols to provide necessary information for
              source validation, creating a prototype implementation of the source validation
              checking and deploy it on the CAIRN testbed.  Through real implementation the
              performance of the new protocols will be investigated including how effectively
              source address validation supports diagnosis of flaws and attacks when it is
              only partially deployed.
