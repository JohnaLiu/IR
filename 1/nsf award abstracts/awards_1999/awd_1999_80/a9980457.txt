The PI proposes to perform a series of numerical
              benchmarks to test the 3D 
spherical TERRA mantle convection code. Velocity
              and temperature values 
and the Nusselt number will be calculated from the
              series of benchmark 
problems specified in 1993 by U. Christensen (European
              Benchmark). The 
calculations will be compared to results obtained from other
              models. The 
outcome of this work will be a quantitative benchmark of the
              TERRA code. 
He also proposes to evaluate the potential of the adjoint fluid
              dynamic 
method in mantle convection models. He will use the adjoint method to
              
estimate unknown initial conditions in idealized mantle convection models.
              
Estimates of the unknown initial conditions of mantle convection simulations
              
will be obtained through a series of coupled forward-in-time and adjoint
              
backward-in-time integrations. The outcome of this work will be to explore
              
the utility and accuracy of the adjoint method in retrieving unknown initial
              
conditions in mantle convection models.
