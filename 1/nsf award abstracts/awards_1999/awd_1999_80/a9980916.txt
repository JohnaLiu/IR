Abstract    :
              Neuroscience students are exploring neural development and the phenomena of
              excitable cells that give rise to resting membrane potentials, action
              potentials, synaptic potentials, and synaptic plasticity. They are doing this
              in the spirit of scientific exploration, with open-ended experiments that they
              are helping to design. Students set the goals, propose experimental methods for
              answering research questions, and analyze and report their findings. This is
              being done in a cooperative environment with the professor acting to facilitate
              exploration rather than presenting a protocol and expected results.  Research
              experiences are making use of live invertebrate animals (crayfish, snail, and
              earthworm), frogs, cultured cells, and computer models.  Significant portions
              of this course are being adapted from a successful neuroscience course
              developed and taught at Rhodes College.  Experience with the pedagogy and
              equipment used in this neuroscience course is being carred over to the revision
              of the team-taught anatomy & physiology courses and other new course
              development.
