Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)
There is a growing awareness in the engineering
              community of the need for integrating more practice-based experiences in the
              undergraduate curricula. An effective way to improve undergraduate engineering
              students' comprehension and ability to apply manufacturing principles is
              through hands-on learning and experimentation. This project uses a metal
              cutting/machining laboratory designed around the learning factory concept,
              adapted from the Penn State model, to enhance teaching and instruction of
              manufacturing principles and applications in the Mechanical and Industrial
              Engineering Programs. The project is enhancing undergraduate learning and
              student ability to apply concepts from school to the workplace and improved
              integration of manufacturing courses in the curricula. The project is directly
              impacting 5 courses and 150 students.
