This will be the first Gordon Research Conference on
              Reversible Association in 
Structural and Molecular Biology.  There has been
              an international recognition of the need for a conference on this topic.  Thus,
              conferences entitled, "Reversible Association in Structural and Molecular
              Biology were held in 1994 (in Melbourne, Australia), 1996 (in Bethesda,
              Maryland), and in 1998 (in Melbourne, Australia).  This GRC will be held in
              Ventura, California in February 2000.  This GRC will focus on cutting-edge
              research that examines the thermodynamics and kinetics of macromolecular
              assembly.  While the topics are chosen to present the results from specific
              systems, the emphasis is on how quantitative studies of macromolecular
              interactions are conducted.  Particular attention is paid to new methods of
              analysis and their proper applications.  The meeting will provide a vital link
              between the experts in particular techniques and persons working on related
              important biochemical problems.  The conference will emphasize the inclusion of
              young scientists, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows.
