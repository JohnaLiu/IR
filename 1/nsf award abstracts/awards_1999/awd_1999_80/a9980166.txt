Abstract    :
              The PIs will develop a knowledge network for the acquisition, representation,
              query and analysis of 3D knowledge in a distributed environment.  Assuming that
              most such knowledge is inherent in and derivable from 3D geometric structures,
              new capabilities and corresponding tools will be developed for combining,
              classifying and analyzing 3D objects and phenomena at variable scales.  To
              achieve these goals, the PIs will focus on the understanding and development of
              mechanisms for mathematical modeling, discipline specific feature extraction,
              archiving, storage, querying, retrieval, matching, visualization and analysis
              of 3D data.  They will develop a software library kernel, tools for data
              archiving, and an Internet-accessible interface to enable users to construct
              customized shape browser search engines.  The work should have immediate
              application to important problems in the biosciences, in biotechnology, and in
              anthropology.
