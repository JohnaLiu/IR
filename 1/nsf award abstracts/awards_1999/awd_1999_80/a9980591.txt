              Management in Software Systems, 3.) Microsystems, 4.) Classification on a
              Remote FPGA Based Custom Computing Machine, 5.) Efficient Simulation of Rare
              Events in Communication Systems and Networks Using DPR, 6.) Faster and More
              Reliable Wireless Communications Using Physical Channel Modeling, 7.)
              Networking, 8.) MTCP: TCP-like Congestion Control for Reliable Multicast, 9.)
              Midlevel Support for Internet 2 Multicast Application, 10.) Adaptive Scheduling
              with Statistical QoS Guarantee, 11.) Assessment and Management of
              Application-Level Quality of Service, 12.) A Protocol for Description of
              End-User Quality of Service, 13.) Operating System and Middleware Support for
              Real-Time Client/Server Systems, 14.) Differentiated Services and Traffic
              Engineering in Multi-Protocol Lable Switching Network, 15.) The Availability,
              Capacity and Performance (ACP) in Wireless Communication Networks, 16.) The
              Effect of Web Caching on Network Planning, 17.) Secure Network Performance
              Research, 18.) Image Processing, 19.) Implementation of Hardware for Image
              Display and Processing, 20.) Image Segmentation using 3-D Active Contours.
