Abstract    :
              The foci of this research are threefold.  First, the preparation of structurally
              unusual ligands capable of bifacial metal ion complexation and the
              stereocontrolled synthesis of open-chain linear arrays well suited for metal
              ion transport will be carried out.   Second, the scaffolding capacity of the
              squarate ester cascade will be adapted to natural product synthesis.  Third,
              inexpensive, optically pure terpenic ketones will be dimerized to afford
              catalysts for asymmetric transformations.  The student training afforded by the
              project should enhance the scientific infrastructure.   

With this Renewal
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research of Dr. Leo A. Paquette of the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State
              University.  Professor Paquette will focus his efforts in three areas.  First,
              spiroether chemistry will be used to prepare synthetic ion channels.  Second,
              the squarate acid cascade process will be used to synthesis natural products
              and, third, chiral ligands for use as catalyst in a broad range of organic
              transformations will be constructed from readily available terpene natural
              products.  The research has the potential to have a broad impact in the
              pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.
