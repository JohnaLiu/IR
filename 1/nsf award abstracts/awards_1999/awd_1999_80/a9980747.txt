Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to identify scaling laws that will be useful in
              the quantitative analysis of transport phenomena involving fractal aggregates. 
              Such structures are a common feature encountered in aerosol reactors producing
              submicron particles.  Their formation is inevitable in industrial reactors
              where high output rates are encountered.  The PIs will develop a logical
              methodology for calculating the scaling laws, which will relate cluster size to
              transport rates and provide a better base for predicting their properties. The
              problem is an important one with significant practical implications. 
              Fractal-like agglomerates represent a class of geometries frequently
              encountered, and a general treatment would be of significant value, especially
              for nanoparticles.  While solutions are available for large classes of
              spherical particles, developing a general treatment for fractal-like particles
              would represent a major advance. They plan to extend their analysis to the
              regime of moderate Knudsen numbers.  The PIs plan to use the Quasi-Monte Carlo
              method, recently developed by others, for reduction of computation time.
