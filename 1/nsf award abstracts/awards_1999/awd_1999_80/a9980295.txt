Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to fabricate new nanoscale devices and to study
              electrical transport properties. The approach involves the use of tunneling
              microscopy(STM) with an atomic hydrogen resist to provide high resolution. The
              difference in chemical reactivity between hydrogen terminated (passivated)
              areas and bare (reactive) Si surface areas provides high selectivity in
              adsorption and growth processes.  Feature sizes less than 3 nm are anticipated.
              The STM will be used to fabricate and image nanowires with atomic resolution.
              1D nanowires and nanoboxes will be fabricated and their electrical transport
              properties studied in situ. Additionally, these nanolithographic fabrication
              techniques allow the creation of devices with a single molecule as the active
              element. STM will be used to image devices during fabrication with atomic
              resolution. Molecular nanodevices will also be fabricated and their electrical
              transport properties studied in situ; substrate will provide an independent
              gate contact. The relationship between nanometer structure, molecular orbitals,
              electrical properties, and contacts will be investigated.

The project
              addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having
              high potential technological relevance. The studies are expected to improve our
              fundamental understanding of possible future nanodevice/transistor
              technologies. An important feature of the program is the integration of
              research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and
              technologically significant area.
