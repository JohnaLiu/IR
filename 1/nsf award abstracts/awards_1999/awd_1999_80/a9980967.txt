Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)
This proposal addresses two weaknesses in undergraduate
              science education. 1) Traditional education in the natural sciences suffers
              from a lack of interdisciplinary linkages. This proposal seeks to enhance
              interdisciplinary education in the natural sciences at Bloomsburg University
              through the addition of new courses and new laboratory exercises utilizing
              Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) as part of a new, multidisciplinary program
              in Environmental Sciences. 2) An interdisciplinary program of Marine Science is
              already taught at the Wallops Island Marine Science Center (WIMSC), of which
              Bloomsburg University is a member. This center is a field station for summer
              courses and student and faculty research, but as a traditional field station,
              it lacks sophisticated analytical equipment. The addition of a SEM will provide
              a unique opportunity to employ analytical techniques in a field setting. This
              proposal requests funds for the purchase of a compact model of SEM that will be
              used on the Bloomsburg campus during the academic year for laboratory exercises
              in the new Environmental Sciences curriculum, as well as for labs in other
              courses in the Biology and Geology curricula, and for student research. During
              the summer months, the machine will be used at the WIMSC, primarily for
              instruction in the multidisciplinary Marine Science curriculum. The SEM is a
              logical choice for this curricular innovation because of its successful
              incorporation in undergraduate education in a variety of disciplines. The ways
              that the SEM is being used in the classroom and field has been influenced by:

              be used in student research projects:
