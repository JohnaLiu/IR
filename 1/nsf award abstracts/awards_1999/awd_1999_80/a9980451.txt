Phase transformations in mantle minerals at
              high pressures and temperatures 
strongly influence the physical properties
              and dynamic processes in the 
Earth's interior.  The objective of this
              laboratory program is to study the 
elastic properties of high-pressure phases
              of mantle minerals using 
ultrasonic techniques in conjunction with
              synchrotron X-radiation.  The new 
elasticity data will then be used to
              interpret seismic models of the 
Earth's mantle in terms of chemical
              composition and mineralogy.  This 
research program takes advantage of the
              special opportunities provided by 
the multi-anvil, large-volume facilities of
              the Stony Brook High Pressure 
Laboratory and the associated analytical
              facilities of the NSF Science and 
Technology Center for High Pressure
              Research (CHiPR), as well as those of 
the National Synchrotron Light Source
              at the nearby Brookhaven National 
Laboratory.
