Abstract    :
              The goal of this Engineering Microsystems: "XYZ" on a Chip project is to
              investigate the fabrication of a micro gas analyzer.  A novel micro gas
              analysis system (MGA), incorporating a microplasma source for gas excitation,
              will be developed.  Other components include a microspectrometer to measure the
              atomic and molecular emission intensity and an optical system coupling the
              light source and detector.  The strategy is to scale down a Fabry-Perot
              spectrometer to approximately one millimeter in size.  Several methods of
              increasing the spectral resolution of the microfabricated spectrometer will be
              implemented.  These include feedback control of the position of the moveable
              mirror using capacitive sensing directly on the mirror's surface,
              post-fabrication of the reflective surfaces for improved optical quality, and
              design of microelectro-mechanical structures to optically collimate the
              plasma-generated light.  The microplasma source will be fabricated using a
              single-mask process to form a 1 -mm diameter inductive coupling coil and two
              interdigitated capacitors for electrically resonating the coil.  The integrated
              MGA will be tested using a representative metal contaminant (Hg) and exhaust
              contaminant (SO2) in air.  This system will be experimentally characterized to
              determine the detection limits of each of these toxins.

The goal is to
              achieve a detection limit of at least 1 ppm.  In conjunction with this goal,
              the fundamental and practical limits may be improved in future work.  This
              project will produce a low-cost, low-power, portable gas analysis system
              capable of sensing a large number of airborne contaminants.
