Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) The objective of this project is to develop a program
              in herpetology that transcends and unifies scientific disciplines and
              emphasizes training students to conduct original, high-quality, publishable
              research. Herpetology, the study of amphibians and reptiles, forms the core of
              a teaching/research program that is being utilized by students (including
              non-majors) taking a variety of courses and involved in various levels of
              original research. Herpetology is an ideal field for such a program because
              studies in herpetology can easily integrate different disciplines in biology.
              To develop such a program, we are working to discover and develop local study
              sites and long-term mark-recapture studies. We are providing training and
              developing courses in modern technological methods (e.g., Geographic
              Information Systems - GIS, Global Positioning Systems - GPS, and automated data
              acquisition) and developing a computerized, relational-database that provides
              the foundation for local studies of amphibians and reptiles. Research in
              herpetology is being adapted for use in a variety of established courses
              including introductory and molecular biology, animal physiology, animal
              behavior, vertebrate field zoology, and biostatistics. The immediate and
              long-term impact will be an exciting teaching/research program that unifies the
              curriculum and provides students with invaluable experience conducting
              high-quality, original research.
