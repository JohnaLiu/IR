This project is a study to identify the types of
              vector wavefield signatures that may be observed in crustal
              refraction/reflection three-component data due to anisotropic terranes within
              the crust and to use these signatures to map the terrane.  The study would a)
              employ anisotropic wave propagation theory to formulate analytical or numerical
              expressions of the cumulative anisotropic effects to waveforms along
              surface-to-surface raypaths typical of crustal scale seismic experiments; b)
              examine two already-existing datasets collected in regions of known anisotropic
              layering; c) obtain quantitative measures of uncertainties for isotropic
              velocity analysis of anisotropic data using synthetic data; and d) examine
              discriminants for separating the cases of anisotropic effects due to uniform
              (bulk) anisotropy, anisotropic heterogeneity, and isotropic heterogeneity
              within the crust.  The three-component crustal refraction/reflection datasets
              are located in southeastern California and both are coincident with outcrops of
              anisotropic terranes with existing petrophysical measurements to indicate
              velocity anisotropy.
