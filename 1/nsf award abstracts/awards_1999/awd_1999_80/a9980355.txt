Abstract    :
              
The proposed research concentrates on developing constraints on the fabric
              (the scale lengths and shapes of complex structures) in the inner core and
              lower mantle of the Earth from analysis and forward modeling of seismic waves
              interacting with these regions.  Knowledge of the fabric of the inner core will
              help in understanding the process of solidification of the solid inner core
              from the liquid outer core, which is an energy source for maintaining the
              Earth's magnetic field.  Knowledge of the fabric of the lower mantle of the
              Earth is important to models of mantle convection, deep plume formation, and
              chemical models of the mantle.  Algorithms of forward modeling of the seismic
              wavefield developed in this research, which involve parallel clustered
              computing, are important to both resource exploration and to physical science
              and engineering applications requiring numerical modeling of phenomena
              described by systems of linear equations containing three-dimensionally varying
              physical properties.
