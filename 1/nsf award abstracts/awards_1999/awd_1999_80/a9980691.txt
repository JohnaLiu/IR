This award is for support for three years of funding to
              reconstruct the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon-13 isotope (d13C)
              concentration in ice cores from Antarctica over several climatic periods.  
              Samples from the Holocene, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)-Holocene transition
              and glacial stadial/interstadial episodes will be examined.  Samples from the
              Siple Dome ice core drilled in 1998/99 will be made, in addition to
              measurements from the Taylor Dome and Vostok ice cores.  The major objectives
              are to investigate the phase relationships between variations in the
              concentration of atmospheric CO2, its carbon isotope composition, and
              temperature changes (indicated by 18dO and dD of the ice) during deglaciations
              as well as across rapid climate change events (e.g. Dansgaard-Oeschger events).
               This will help to determine systematic changes in the global carbon cycle
              during and between different climatic periods, and to ascertain if the widely
              spread northern hemisphere temperature stadial/interstadial events produced a
              global atmospheric carbon dioxide signal.  Proven experimental techniques will
              be used.
