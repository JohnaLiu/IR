Title:	NMR on a Chip: a Micro-NMR
              Device for in situ Detection of
Chloride in Concrete


The goal of this
              Engineering Microsystems: "XYZ" on a Chip project is to investigate the
              hypothesis that a micro nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based detector,
              defined as all aspects of an NMR other than the magnet and power supply, can
              detect chloride ion in concrete.  The coils, oscillator, and essential
              electronics of an NMR, typically a large expensive device, are being created on
              a single chip with the CMOS process.  The coil turns are one micron thick and
              one to two millimeters in diameter.  The team includes faculty from civil
              engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and physics.  The
              project's first stage is modeling and theoretical analysis of a micro NMR.  The
              second stage consists of experiments aimed at demonstrating that the micro NMR
              can detect protons.   This is a useful intermediate objective because the
              response of protons is 100 times larger than chloride and the signal can be
              used for calibration of the chloride detection. The third stage is measuring
              the concentration of free chloride in concrete.  The results of this work
              underpin a sensor technology that could have a substantial impact on the
              nation's civil infrastructure.  For example, an economical chloride sensor
              based on NMR and dispersed throughout a bridge deck can trigger remediation
              that prevents loss of the structure due to corrosion of the steel
              reinforcement.  The broader impact of the project is creation of a technology
              that could find biomedical and other applications.
