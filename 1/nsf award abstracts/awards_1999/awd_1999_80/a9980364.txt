This award provides support for three years for analysis of
              sediments from beneath current and past grounded ice of the West Antarctic ice
              sheet.  Diatoms and 10Be will be used not only for evidence of past deglacial
              conditions, but also as sedimentary tracers of microstratigraphic variability
              in piston cores recovered by Caltech glaciologists from beneath ice streams B,
              C and D, and inter-stream ridges.  Similar analyses will be performed on
              sediment cores recovered from beneath the southern Ross Ice Shelf, and the
              southern Ross Sea near the ice front.  Diatoms make excellent sedimentary
              tracers because, unlike most sedimentary particles, they have known initial
              conditions (original size, shape, approximate age, and environment of origin). 
              The current study includes quantitative analysis of comminution of Ross Sea
              diatoms, from laboratory studies, using the ring-shear device developed by
              Iverson et al. (1998).  Preliminary analyses suggest distinctive patterns of
              diatom breakage that could lead to guidelines for estimating load and shearing
              of marine diamictons, which may have important implications for interpreting
              past ice sheet configurations.
