Abstract    :
              Physics (13) It has been well established by science education researchers that
              students learn most when actively engaged. The predominant form for teaching
              undergraduate science classes, however, is the passive lecture format, which
              has been shown to contribute little to help students develop a coherent body of
              knowledge. One established way to engage students in large lectures is to
              intersperse brief lectures with conceptual questions, called ConcepTests, which
              are designed to challenge students to think about the fundamental concepts and
              gain practice explaining their ideas. Although hundreds of faculty around the
              country in many disciplines are already using this strategy, called Peer
              Instruction, most lecturers continue to follow the traditional passive lecture
              format.
In this project the group is making Peer Instruction easier to
              implement, by developing a suite of related Internet utilities and recruiting
              and supporting additional faculty for Peer Instruction. The deliverables of
              this project, which is aimed at instructors and students in introductory
              physics courses nationwide, include an expanded database of ConcepTests,
              utilities for retrieving these ConcepTests in class-ready format, on-line
              testing facilities, and supporting facilities for students.
