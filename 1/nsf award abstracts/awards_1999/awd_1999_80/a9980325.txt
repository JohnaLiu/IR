Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Michigan State University for the support of a
              two year, Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) project entitled,
              "Multiphase Transport Phenomena Curriculum Development," under the direction of
              Dr. Charles A. Petty.  The goal of this project is to develop and implement a
              multi-institutional curriculum on multiphase transport phenomena (MTP) that
              builds on the existing course offerings in the participating departments. The
              proposed MTP curriculum draws on the research accomplishments of nine
              laboratories at Michigan State University, the University of Akron, and the
              University of Tulsa.  An important object of the project is to provide training
              on the practical use of multiphase computation fluid dynamics (CFD).  The new
              curriculum will be designed to 1) train students from different engineering
              backgrounds in the use of multiphase computational fluid dynamics; 2) introduce
              students to state-of-the-art experimental techniques employed to validate
              multiphase transport models; and, 3) teach students how to critically analyze
              and interpret CFD results.
