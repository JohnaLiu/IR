Abstract    :
              This project, which is a renewal of an ongoing effort, makes use of the ice
              sheet at South Pole to build a large detector of very high-energy astrophysical
              neutrinos.  The detector was constructed between 1,400 and 2,400 meters below
              the surface by melting holes into the ice with a hot water drill and then
              freezing in long stings of widely space photomultiplier tubes.  Occasionally
              upward going neutrinos, which have passed through the bulk of the Earth,
              interact in the ice, producing charged particles, the Antarctic Muon and
              Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA), detects the resulting flash of light, from
              which the energy and direction of flight of the original neutrino can be
              deduced.  Because neutrinos are so penetrating, and because they are not
              deflected by magnetic fields, they offer the opportunity to see inside of
              regions of the universe that are completely obscured from study by any other
              technique.  The present detector has 19 strings in place, and this award will
              provide the manpower and equipment necessary to calibrate the strings that were
              installed in the austral summer of 1999/2000, maintain the detector and analyze
              the resulting data.  It will also provide some funding toward advanced
              technology development aimed toward the possible eventual construction of a
              cubic kilometer detector, IceCube.

AMANDA is a collaboration of the
              University of Wisconsin (this award), the Universities of California at
              Berkeley and Irvine, Lawrence Berkley national Laboratory (partly funded though
              this award), the Universities of Stockholm, Kalmar and Uppsula (Sweden), DESY,
              the Universities of Wuppertal and Mainz  (Germany), and the Universities of
              Brussels and Mons (Belgium).  The institutions other than Wisconsin and some of
              LBNL are funded through different channels.   Within the US, this project is
              supported by DoE, and within NSF by the Division of Physics and the Office of
              Polar Programs.
