The Exploratorium requests $1,389,665  to develop "Live @ the
              Exploratorium:  Origins."  The Exploratorium will conduct a three-year pilot
              project to develop an experimental series of Webcasts, related Web-based
              resources, and museum activities . The project will use new communications
              technologies to create an ongoing link between Internet and museum audiences
              and current scientific research efforts at observatories around the world where
              scientists are investigating the origins of matter, the universe, the Earth,
              and life itself.  The Exploratorium will establish a remote connection to six
              science research locations investigating particle physics, cosmology, polar
              research, earthquake research, astrobiology and genetics.  During each live
              Webcast museum visitors and Internet visitors will be able to interact with
              scientists at the remote observatories.
