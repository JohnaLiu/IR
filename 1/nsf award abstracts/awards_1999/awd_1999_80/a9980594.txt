Abstract    :
              This award provides the funds to continue flying balloon borne instruments from
              McMurdo, Antarctica to measure stratospheric ozone and polar stratospheric
              cloud particles.  The annual Antarctic ozone hole remains the most impressive
              example of how mankind has altered the global atmosphere with pollutants, in
              this case chlorofluorocarbons.  Ozone is the Earth's only protection from the
              solar ultraviolet radiation (UV-B) that is capable of destroying living matter.
               The actual causes and mechanisms of the formation ozone hole appear to be
              fairly well understood; however, continued monitoring of the state of the
              stratosphere will allow comparisons of the model predictions with actual events
              in the stratosphere.  On an issue of such great importance as the exposure of
              the surface of the Earth to harmful solar ultraviolet radiation, it is
              important to keep track of what is happening both to gain improved scientific
              understanding and as a matter of public policy.

This project is jointly
              funded by the Office of Polar Programs and the Division of Atmospheric
              Sciences.
