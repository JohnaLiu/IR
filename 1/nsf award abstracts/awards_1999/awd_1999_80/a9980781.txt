Abstract    :
              The goal of this Engineering Microsystems: "XYZ" on a Chip project is to
              investigate microfabricated fuel cells.  Miniature fuel processors for in situ
              hydrogen production are of particular interest in compact fuel cells, which are
              currently being considered as alternative power sources for portable devices. 
              In this project an integrated design including microfabrication and control of
              a prototype catalytic microreaction system for methanol fuel reforming will be
              carried out.  The main components of the fuel processor are mixer/vaporizer,
              catalytic steam reformer, water-gas shift reactor, and integrated
              heaters/sensors with control electronics.  These components will be
              microfabricated on a single silicon wafer.  A fundamental understanding and
              characterization of the integrated microplant will complement the experimental
              program.  Rigorous models will be developed for the poorly understood
              characteristics of catalytic microreactor structures and membrane-based
              reaction/permeation microreaction schemes.  Low-order models will be developed
              from measured input/output data for synthesizing and implementing external
              supervisory model-based multivariable feedback control algorithms through the
              electronic interface of the microplant.  From the results of the research, new
              concepts in catalytic and membrane-based catalytic microreactors, microreactor
              feedback control, and miniature fuel processing hydrogen delivery systems for
              fuel cells will be developed.  It is anticipated that these new
              interdisciplinary concepts will open new areas of fundamental and applied
              research in miniature integrated catalytic chemical processing systems, while
              introducing new educational themes in electronic processing, microfabrication,
              reaction engineering, process design, and process control.
