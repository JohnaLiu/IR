Abstract    :
              This project entails the continued development and refinement of software
              suitable for the automated recognition and identification of individual
              dolphins from digital photographs of dolphin dorsal fins. The goal of the
              project will focus on improving the accuracy and reliability of the recognition
              process in existing computer vision software which provides an interface to a
              database of dolphin dorsal fin images. This project is part of the larger
              Digital Analysis of Whale Images on a Network (DARWIN) computer vision project
              at Eckerd College, an undergraduate institution. DARWIN currently provides a
              means for the storage and access of digital images of dolphin dorsal fins and
              associated observational data.
