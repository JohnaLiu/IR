The PI proposes to develop models of
              lithospheric stress to assess the relative contributions of long-wavelength
              intra-lithospheric, plate boundary tractions, and mantle sources to the stress
              field.  The following questions will be addressed in detail: 1) Does mantle
              flow contribute to the intraplate stress field?  2) Can a long-wavelength
              contribution in lithospheric sources be distinguished?  What is their relative
              magnitude compared to the mantle derived tractions?  3) What can be said to
              first order about how the stress field evolved during the Cenozoic? Can any
              questions about the cause of plate rearrangements be answered?  4) What are the
              consequences of abrupt changes in plate motion on the state of stress of a
              plate? Does a new fracturing pattern develop?  This research will contribute to
              our understanding of the interplay between plate tectonics and the dynamics of
              the Earth's interior.
