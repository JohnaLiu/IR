Coptopaxi Volcano, Ecuador, provides an unparalleled
              opportunity to constrain the mechanisms and timescales of magma differentiation
              at an active arc volcano. A detailed and complete  tephra record at the
              volcano, comprising widespread layers of pumice and ash, has been painstakingly
              elucidated by our colleagues and collaborators at the Instituto Geofisico in
              Quito. From this, we can conclude that Cotopaxi has erupted regularly over the
              past few thousand years, with an average periodicity of around 120 years. The
              erupted products vary in composition leading to different styles of eruption.
              The cycles are punctuated by occasional explosive eruptions of rhyolite. The
              methodology will involve comprehensive petrological and geochemical analyses of
              the rocks - with a particular emphasis on obtaining information from the
              constituent phases such as minerals and melt inclusions. By comparing
              stratigraphically constrained erupted products we will be able to effectively
              take "snapshots" of the state of the magma reservoir(s) through time and
              address a number of important questions - including;  1) What are the principle
              mechanisms of magmatic differentiation (how does a given magma relate to or
              evolve from one that erupted a hundred years or so earlier)? 2) What are the
              timescales over which magmatic diversity  (how long does it take to generate
              extreme compositions such as rhyolites)?  3) How do (1) and (2) relate to
              variations in the volcano's style of eruption?
