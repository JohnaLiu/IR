Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Oklahoma for the support of a
              Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) project entitled, "Energy
              Production and Risk Management in a Competitive Environment," under the
              direction of Dr. Arthur M. Breipohl.  The goal of this project is to develop a
              new curriculum for electrical engineers that integrates recent advances in
              power system planning and resource scheduling with the use of options and
              commodity futures contracts to manage risk.  In addtion to the development of
              the M.S. program, this project will result in the development of teaching
              modules for two courses and an educational version of a successful commercial
              simulator that is used in scheduling of and planning for generation assets. 
              The primary objective of this proposed program is to teach and simulate the
              integrated power system operation and financial trading environment in the
              emerging energy industry.  The proposed curriculum comprises new courses
              co-taught by engineering, business, and education school faculty; lab-based
              simulations that integrate power system operations, financial trading, and risk
              management; and student projects and internships.
