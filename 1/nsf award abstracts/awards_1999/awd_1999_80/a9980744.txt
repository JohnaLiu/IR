Abstract    :
              	An important problem in forecasting extratropical "weather-producing"
              disturbances involves understanding how these features propagate from one
              location to another.  For example, daily weather patterns over North America
              are influenced by synoptic-scale disturbances that originate over the North
              Pacific Ocean and subsequently propagate eastward.  Exactly how and under
              circumstances this rapid downstream spreading of disturbances affects the
              weather over North America is an open and important question.  Dr. Hakim will
              test his hypothesis for how this occurs, namely that the structural properties
              of the North Pacific jet stream, such as the horizontal and vertical profiles
              of wind and temperature, affect the downstream response to cyclogenesis events
              since the flow properties control how the waves grow and propagate.  The study
              will include diagnosing observations of the evolution of cyclogenesis events
              occurring over the western North Pacific ocean and identifying flow regimes
              conducive for downstream development, analyzing operational model error
              characteristics for such events, and modeling downstream development using
              idealized zonally varying jet streams.  The results may serve as a basis for
              future studies concerned with targeted and enhanced observations upstream from
              the North American continent.
