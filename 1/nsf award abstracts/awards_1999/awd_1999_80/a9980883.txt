Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

This project adapts materials and ideas developed
              by a number of research programs to promote visualization and reasoning skills
              of undergraduate students. It seeks to improve the breadth, quality, and
              relevance of quantitative reasoning and spatial analysis skills. The project
              responds to a completely revamped university-wide liberal studies program, as
              well as national trends in mathematics education. Under the liberal studies
              changes, students complete a foundational mathematics requirement by taking one
              or more of eight courses affected by this project. Project activities include
              installing computer display units in classrooms used by the target courses,
              developing visualization materials, examples and technology exercises in
              context, adapting materials from other projects, and interacting with faculty
              in non-technical areas to develop reinforcing activities. The project provides
              increased opportunity in these courses for visualization of mathematical and
              statistical concepts, exposition of concepts in disciplinary contexts, and
              experience with technology useful for quantitative reasoning and spatial
              analysis.
