Abstract    :
              This award provides  funds for ten PCs, RedHat LINUX 6.0 plus compilers, network
              equipment, and the development of a COMET modulel library.  The funds will be
              used to purchase two LINUX based PC-servers and a color laser printer to
              complete the upgrade of Western Kentucky's computer facilities.    These
              upgrades will enhance the education of students, particularly at the
              undergraduate level, provide the means to tackle new research projects, and
              enable us to more fully participate in the UNIDATA community.
