The goal of this Engineering Microsystems:  "XYZ" on a Chip
              project will develop a fundamental approach for integrating the functions of
              cellular and materials components in hybrid devices. Self-assembled monolayers
              of alkanethiolates on gold that present peptide ligands will be used as model
              substrates that control the interactions between cells and the substrate. The
              program will develop electroactive monolayers that can modulate, in real time,
              the activity of immobilized ligands that interact with the surface receptors of
              attached cells. The strategy is based on the design of electroactive groups
              that undergo oxidation or reduction when electrical potentials are applied to
              the underlying gold. When these electroactive groups are incorporated into the
              structures of ligands immobilized to the monolayers, they can be used to effect
              changes in the activity of the ligands. This program will deliver three classes
              of electroactive monolayers that can be used to control the behaviors of
              attached cells. These include monolayers that selectively release immobilized
              ligands, monolayers that turn on the activity of immobilized ligands, and
              monolayers that reversibly modulate the activity of immobilized ligands. A
              related effort will develop electroactive ligands that can report on the
              binding of cellular receptors, and hence transduce biological signals into
              electrical outputs. Because this class of monolayers is designed to efficiently
              convert electrical signals into biological signals, it represents an add-on
              capability to the mature technology of integrated circuits. The strategies
              developed here may be important to designing a broad range of hybrid devices
              that combine cellular and materials components for use in diagnostics, tissue
              engineering, indwelling sensors, neural computation, and BioMEMS.
