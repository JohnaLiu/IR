              Abstract

This proposal seeks funds to support a summer 1999 SGER expedition
              to collect long (l0+m) Kullenberg piston cores from a swath of 9-12 varved lake
              sites that takes efficient advantage of several convergent scientific needs,
              technical developments, and logistical opportunities. The proponents have
              identified some 30 lakes deeper than 25m across Michigan with high potential
              for non-glacial calcareous Holocene varve sequences. The main scientific goal
              is collect a suite of cores to test hypotheses of solar rhythms and abrupt
              climatic events. If externally forced, these should be coherent in similar
              time-windows on a continental scale, a lingering challenge from a
              recently-completed thesis for sites in Minnesota. This pilot project also
              promises other significant achievements intended to promote the Earth System
              History community: 1) to complete development of a highly-mobile and
              cost-effective system for collecting piston cores up to 14m long in lakes
              greater than 25m deep. This system will then become available to other
              investigator teams, 2) to train a young coring operations team of 4 persons at
              LRC who can provide continuing expertise to this community, and 3) to collect
              and describe valuable cores according to new standards of protocol and curation
              that will catalyze research and provide samples to other investigator
              projects.
