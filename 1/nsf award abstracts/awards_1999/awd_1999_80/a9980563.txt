	Molecular evolution has become the nexus of many areas of
              biological research. It integrates and enriches such areas as biochemistry,
              bioinformatics, developmental biology, genomics, microbiology, population
              biology, systematics, and phylogenetics. The Workshop in Molecular Evolution at
              the Marine Biological Laboratory is the largest and most influential course in
              the field. Started in 1988, the workshop has garnered an international
              reputation for excellence in teaching molecular evolution. With ca. 60 students
              enrolled each year, the Workshop has provided a rich and intensive learning
              experience for nearly 660 students since its inception, with an additional 60
              students to be trained in each of the next three years. Because of the wide
              range of fields addressed in the study of molecular evolution, it is difficult
              to find a comprehensive course offered in a single university setting; it is
              rare for a single institution to maintain expertise in all the necessary areas.
              In contrast, the Workshop is uniquely able to provide necessary breadth and
              depth by utilizing a large number of visiting faculty with appropriate
              expertise, all of them leaders in their respective fields. Furthermore, the
              flexible nature of the workshop, with alternating lectures and hands-on
              computer laboratories, allows for rapid adaptation to changes in this dynamic
              field. 
	Over the next three years, the Workshop will be administered by Dr.
              Michael Cummings, trained in comparative molecular evolutionary studies and
              with experience working with many different groups of organisms. Specific
              objectives include advanced training in theoretical and analytical aspects of
              molecular evolution, in computational resources available for such
              investigations, in database mining for comparative and mechanistic studies, and
              for the promotion of interdisciplinary projects in molecular biology,
              phylogenetics, and population biology. Student selection and outreach will
              continue to capitalize on the broad range of institutions represented over the
              past several years (more than 150), with women students comprising over 41% of
              the population. In addition, MBL will support development of a website for the
              Molecular Evolution workshop, to make available more generally the resources
              and findings that emerge from the activity.
