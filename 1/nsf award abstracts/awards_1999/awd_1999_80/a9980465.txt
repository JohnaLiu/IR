Most mid- and high-latitude mountain ranges have been
              sculpted dramatically
by glacial erosion. The isolated spires, narrow ridges,
              long bare-rock
hillslopes, and broad valleys of alpine terrain immediately
              give a
qualitative impression that glaciers are highly efficient erosive
              agents
and that glacial erosion produces considerable relief.  However, little
              is
known quantitatively about the rates and patterns of glacial erosion,
              the
factors that control them, nor even the morphological consequences of
              a
shift from fluvial (non-glacial) to glacial erosion.  We propose to
              exploit
natural laboratories at the southern limit of glaciation where
              adjacent
fully-, partially-, and un-glaciated, but otherwise similar, basins
              can be
studied.  We identify two field settings in the eastern Sierra
              Nevada,
California, and the northern Sangre de Cristo range, Colorado, where
              one
may estimate quantitatively the amount and pattern of topographic
              change
attributable to glacial erosion alone as a function of the intensity
              of
glaciation.  We propose a research program in these two field
              settings
combining field mapping, DEM analysis, and cosmogenic isotope dating
              to
test quantitatively 5 hypotheses developed during a
              preliminary
investigation of glacial landforms and erosion
