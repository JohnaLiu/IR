Abstract    :
              The Science, Technology and Research Transit Access Point (STAR TAP) was funded
              by NSF ANI-9712283 for the period May 1,1997-April 30, 2000.  The current award
              funds a three-year continuation of the pivotal infrastructure services provided
              by STAR TAP.  STAR TAP services will be expanded in depth to take account of
              dynamic changes that have taken place in high performance networking since the
              inception of the Next Generation Internet (NGI) Program as well as related
              domestic (e.g., Internet 2) and foreign (e.g., Canada, Japan, Singapore,
              Netherlands, Israel, Nordic countries and others to follow) initiatives.  The
              nature of the effort, however, is substantially unchanged, namely to support
              global collaborations on progressing high performance networking and advanced
              networked applications by providing persistent, reliable interconnections
              between domestic and international partner advanced academic networks.
