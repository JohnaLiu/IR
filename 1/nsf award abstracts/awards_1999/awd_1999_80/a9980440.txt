This grant supports theoretical research on the statistical
              mechanics of lattice models.  It is supported by the Divisions of Materials
              Research and Mathematical Sciences.  Lattice models play an essential role in
              the modern theory of critical phenomena, which finds wide applications in
              physics, materials research and other disciplines including engineering and
              mathematics.   This research involves theoretical studies of lattice models
              with emphases on exact and rigorous results and their applications.

Exact
              analyses of lattice models have been restricted in the past mostly to systems
              in two dimensions.  This project proposes to study 3-dimensional systems
              relevant to real physics.  The study of a directed percolation model in three
              dimensions will also be conducted.  In addition, investigation of 2-dimensional
              systems will be carried out including: the Ising model; dimer statistics;
              Fisher zeroes of the Potts model; quantum spin systems; applications to crystal
              surfaces; and, applications in mathematics.
