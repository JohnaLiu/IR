Abstract    :
              This work is the continuation of a joint project with the Polar Research
              Institute of China to make measurements of the structure of the upper ocean in
              the northern Weddell Sea along the route taken by the PRI's antarctic supply
              vessel, R/V Xue Long.   The observations, obtained from expendable instruments,
              complement existing hydrographic observations along various transects through
              the northwestern Weddell Sea region and data from moored current meter arrays
              in the Weddell-Scotia confluence zone.   This effort builds upon a successful
              series of expendable bathythermographs and conductivity-temperature-depth
              probes obtained by the science party on board the R/V Xue Long in the 1998
              pilot phase of this project.

The west-to-east transit of the Weddell Sea by
              the ship makes it possible to obtain a series of ocean soundings that are
              otherwise unobtainable.  The information is particularly important because it
              has been shown that the Indian Ocean sector is an anomalous region with respect
              to connections between antarctic and lower latitude climatic features and
              indices. In the pilot program the necessary data acquisition system, both
              software and hardware, were installed in the ship and an excellent working
              relationship with Chinese antarctic scientists was developed.
