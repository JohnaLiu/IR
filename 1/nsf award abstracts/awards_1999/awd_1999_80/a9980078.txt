Abstract    :
              The program, funded under the KDI  initiative, will form a multi-disciplinary
              team to develop an advanced computing and communications technology for the
              purpose of producing a predictive model of Space Weather.  The model will be
              referred to as the Comprehensive Space Environment Model (CSEM) and will be
              entirely based on the fundamental physics processes that control space weather.
               The CSEM will couple models of the solar corona and solar wind with a model of
              the Earth's magnetosphere.  The magnetosphere model will then be coupled to a
              comprehensive model of the ionosphere and thermosphere.  Because the members of
              the collaboration are located at many different institutions, new techniques
              for using the Internet to foster collaborations will be used.  The program
              contains a strong education component both for graduate students and
              undergraduates.  In addition, a public outreach effort is included in the
              program.
