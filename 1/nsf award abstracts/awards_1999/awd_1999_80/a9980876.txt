This project provides support to the state of Alaska
              for a planning grant designed to help Alaska set priorities for the improvement
              of the basic science and engineering research infrastructure in the state. 
              Alaska's goal is to strengthen research facilities and expertise in targeted
              disciplines, enhance training and education for students in science and
              engineering, and increase efforts to promote transfer of technology from the
              state's universities to Alaska's private and public sectors.  The planning
              process will address five areas, including: 1) assessment of Alaska's existing
              research infrastructure; 2) identification of Alaska's emerging areas of
              research excellence; 3) identification of the barriers to improving Alaska's
              research infrastructure; 4) establishment of state priorities for science and
              engineering research; and 5) establishment of a ten year plan to address
              Alaska's science and engineering needs.   The planning phase is expected to
              culminate in preparation of a research infrastructure implemenation proposal to
              the National Science Foundation.
