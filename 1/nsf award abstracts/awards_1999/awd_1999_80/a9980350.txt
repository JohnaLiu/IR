Abstract    :
              This award to Professors Joseph Lauher and Frank Fowler at SUNY, Stony Brook, is
              supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry
              Division.  The focus of the research will be the application of solid state
              host-guest interactions for the formation of macromolecular networks with
              controlled intermolecular interactions, orientations and distances. Fundamental
              principles and strategies for the preparation of supramolecular networks using
              solid state topochemical polymerizations will be studied. Polymerizations of
              dienes, halodiactylenes, tetraacetylenes and their analogues will be used to
              develop robust two dimensional conjugated polymers, including channeled solids,
              open molecular networks and nanotubes with unique optical and electronic
              properties.
Polymers with controlled networks and pore sizes will be prepared
              under this research.  Because of their unique structure and orientation, these
              polymer networks and nanotubes will have optical and electronic properties not
              observed in other materials.  In addition, robust nature of the polymer matrix
              and architecture make them suitable for environmentally stable applications in
              sensors and electronic devices.
