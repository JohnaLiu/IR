This project is an adaptation and implementation of
              a case study model for instruction to provide the context and motivation for
              design-oriented laboratory experiences in undergraduate Human Factors and
              Ergonomics (HFE) courses. The goals of the project are: 1) To emphasize the
              application of human factors and ergonomics course material to real-world
              problems through integrated, design oriented laboratory experiences; 2) To
              ground the study of HFE within the context of industrial engineering, using a
              manufacturing case study to motivate the laboratories; 3) To provide students
              with laboratory experiences in which they can obtain skills in the
              identification of research or design questions, and the development of
              methodologies to investigate those questions; 4) To provide students with
              exposure to and skills in using current technologies and techniques in
              interface prototyping and industrial ergonomics work analysis; and 5) To
              motivate students of different learning styles to master course material. The
              project includes the development of an automotive manufacturing case study to
              be used in two required HFE courses, in cooperation with HFE personnel from two
              large automotive manufacturing facilities. The case material includes a
              description of the overall manufacturing system, seven multi-period
              laboratories across the two courses, and computer modules designed to support
              the design and analysis activities in the laboratories. Case material is being
              developed, the courses are being taught using the modified laboratories, and an
              evaluation is being conducted to compare student performance in the courses
              before and after the proposed laboratories are implemented. Among other
              methods, a web site is being developed to disseminate the case material.
