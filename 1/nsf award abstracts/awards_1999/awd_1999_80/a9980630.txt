Abstract    :
              WestEd proposes this study to explore issues of synergy in systemic reform and
              to create an instrument to document and measure such synergy.  Of primary
              interest is the synergy between the SSI and the USIs.   The goal of this study
              is to develop instrumentation to identify and measure synergy in systemic
              reform. The proposes study plans to fulfill to needs:  1)deepen the conceptual
              understanding of synergy in reform and 2) from this enhanced understanding,
              create and field test instruments to measure this synergy.
