Abstract    :
              The proposal requests support for the fourth bi-annual open-invitation
              Conference on Zebrafish Development and Genetics.  The meeting will focus on
              the developmental biology, genetics and genomics of the zebrafish.  It will
              emphasize the cellular, molecular, and genetic regulation of development and
              growth in zebrafish, the only vertebrate in which systematic large scale
              screens for embryonic lethal mutations have been conducted.  The following
              sessions are planned:  1) Early development and patterning I; 2) Neural
              development; 3) Axonal pathfinding; 4) Neural crest and sensory organs; 5)
              Genomics and genetic strategies; 6) Methods and new technology; 7) Cell
              differentiation; 8) Cell fate choices; 9) Cell signalling; 10) Tissue and organ
              patterning; and 11) Zebrafish as a model for human disease.  The Keynote
              address will be given by an investigator whose primary interest is not
              zebrafish, but who is likely to stimulate zebrafish workers to broaden their
              ways of thinking about the ways they approach their research topic.  The
              proposed meeting will attract members from most zebrafish laboratories, and
              will provide an open arena for the presentation of the latest research results.
               It will also provide an opportunity for the exchange of materials and
              information about evolving technologies and methodological approaches.  About
              480 people attended the previous meeting and presentations were given by
              investigators from 26 countries.
