Abstract    :
              Chemistry  (12)
The goals of this project are to advance instruction in
              sophomore, junior, and senior-level chemistry courses by adaptation and
              implementation of modern NMR experiments from recent chemical literature.  In
              the sophomore level organic chemistry courses, students are introduced to NMR
              as a structure determination tool using simple 1D and 2D experiments.  In
              physical chemistry, advanced experiments using the nuclear Overhouser effect
              (NOE) to study binding activity for several known ligands are introduced. 
              Descriptive inorganic chemistry is adapting and implementing experiments which
              use variable temperature and multinuclear NMR for the study of fluxional
              molecules.  Biochemistry courses are offering peptide conformation studies and
              implementing experiments which use F-17 as a tool for the study of enzyme
              kinetics.  A special topics course on NMR is also adapting experiments taken
              from chemical literature.  Several of these courses are undertaking kinetics
              experiments using the variable temperature unit and using the LAN network as
              well as the WWW to transfer data to workstations in the computer labs for
              off-line data processing.  The 400 MHz NMR spectrometer is also contributing to
              the success of many ongoing undergraduate research projects and enabling
              student-faculty research collaborations on projects which were not possible
              previously.  These capabilities are improving the University's ability to
              attract talented young faculty and students.
