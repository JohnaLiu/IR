Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) The goal of this project is to upgrade the research
              training program in physiological psychology at Vassar College.  As a result of
              the modernization of our teaching/research laboratory space, we are now
              incorporating more sophisticated techniques for exploring physiological
              processes that are correlated with behavioral systems.  A main goal of the
              current project is to incorporate neurochemical techniques, specifically
              neuropeptide immunocytochemistry and brain enzyme analyses, in this particular
              course.  A secondary goal is to provide opportunities for students to continue
              on and incorporate contemporary neurochemical approaches to exploring
              relationships between physiological and behavioral systems in their advanced
              independent research projects.  The laboratory exercises are adapted from
              exercises demonstrated at a Project Kaleidoscope workshop.  The equipment is
              also being used by faculty, especially the PI of this project, in ongoing
              faculty research programs, programs that actively involve several undergraduate
              students each semester. Finally, in addition to enhancing the research training
              program in the Psychology Department, upgrading of the laboratory component of
              this course is expected to have substantial positive effects on the curriculum
              of the Biopsychology Program.
