Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99) This project is incorporating modern instrumentation for
              elemental analysis throughout the basic science curriculum at Earlham College
              in chemistry, biology, and geology. The PI and team have chosen an inductively
              coupled plasma - atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) for its rapid capacity
              to perform multi-elemental analysis, which will permit a larger student
              population to use the instrument. Three expected outcomes guide this project.
              One, chemistry majors and minors are gaining exposure to usage of the ICP-AES
              through laboratory experiments in their standard courses which use the
              instrument, and through student-faculty research projects. Two, students from
              other disciplines - in particular biology and geology - are gaining experience
              with the fundamental role that chemical information plays in science, by
              analyzing samples obtained from work in their own discipline. Third,
              non-science majors at Earlham are using the instrumentation to analyze data
              obtained in a study of environmental issues. The project team expects to
              positively influence the disposition of these non-science majors towards
              science. Source material to support the use of this instrumentation is being
              adapted from several sources. These include the American Chemical Society's
              book, "Chemistry in Context" (for the introductory course for non-science
              majors), the work of Webster et al., DUE award #9751439  (for investigating the
              presence of trace metals in pure and contaminated soil samples in an
              Environmental Chemistry course), and the work of Downey et al., DUE award
              #9750867 (adaptations of ICP-MS experiments to ICP-AES experiments).
