Researchers from many fields have shown that a natural
              extension of the classical advection-dispersion equation (ADE) uses
              fractional-order derivatives.  A fractional ADE has been shown to agree with
              data from a number of tracer tests that defy other modeling approaches. 
              However, a number of unanswered questions remain.  We will test and extend the
              theory through a series of numerical and analytic studies.  Among our tasks is
              the creation of detailed K fields with new and existing generators that exploit
              power-law distributions.  We will compare the resulting statistics of velocity
              and particle transport to those predicted by the fractional theory.  We will
              supplement the numerical work with extended analytic expressions for
              heavy-tailed motions to see the effect of temporal correlation on the transport
              equation.  We will also develop and test finite-element and random walk
              numerical models of a fractional ADE and generalize our work in 3-D to allow
              for different types of motion in all directions.  These extensions will be
              tested against the conservative solute plumes at the MADE and Cape Cod
              aquifers.  We will also rederive the governing equations in a more
              straightforward Eulerian setting via fractional-order Taylor series expansions
              and relate parameters to measurable aquifer properties.  Finally, since the
              diverging variance of Levy motion is somewhat problematic, we will develop
              alternate measures for fractal random functions and relate these to our
              observations.
