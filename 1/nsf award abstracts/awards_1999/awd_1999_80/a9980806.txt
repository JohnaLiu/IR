Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
This project is being carried out in conjunction with a major
              curriculum review and transformation process, major emphasis being on reform of
              the laboratory programs, based on the belief that the laboratory should lead
              the curriculum.  General chemistry, introductory organic labs, and analytical
              lab sequences are being reformed, with main emphasis on guided inquiry-based
              laboratory experiences, and with student-oriented learning being supported
              through information technology and advanced computer tools.  A computer center
              that serves lower level, introductory courses currently exists.  This project
              is providing initial funding for a complementary facility for use by organic
              chemistry students, upperclassmen, chemistry majors, and students in a new
              interdisciplinary program in molecular biology, biochemistry, and
              bioinformatics.  This facility supports recently acquired advanced analytical
              instrumentation, designed to introduce discovery-based experiments into upper
              level laboratory courses.  Experiments that utilize the facility are adapted
              from journals such as J. Chem. Ed. and further developed for use by faculty who
              are being trained in the implementation of these discovery-based experiments. 
              Assessment of faculty experiences and student achievement provides feedback
              concerning the impact of the approach on upper level laboratory curriculum.
