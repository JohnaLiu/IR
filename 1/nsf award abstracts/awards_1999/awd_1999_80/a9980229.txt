Abstract    :
              This award provides partial travel support and local expenses for 10 graduate
              students and/or new researchers to attend the conference and tutorial session
              on Nonlinear Statistical Models on November 4-6, 1999 at the University of
              Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.  The conference will focus on the development
              and implementation of nonlinear stochastic models and particularly, the
              application to problems in the biological sciences and industry.  Four major
              sessions are proposed: General Linear Models, Pharmacokinetic Models and
              Generalized Compartment Models, Mixture Models, and Applications of Models and
              Industry.  Each session will feature a keynote address and approximately three
              half-hour talks by leading experts in the field.  The conference begins Friday
              morning, November 5, and runs through Saturday afternoon November 6, 1999.  In
              addition, a special one-day workshop consisting of two tutorials will be held
              on Thursday November 4, prior to the conference.  The topics are: An Overview
              of Compartmental models, taught by Professor David Allen, and Algorithms for
              Nonlinear Models, by the conference organizers.  Graduate students and new
              researchers are encouraged to attend the tutorials, and also present their
              research in a special poster session.
