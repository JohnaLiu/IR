This is a renewal award for a theoretical effort involving five
              separate components, all of whihch involve strongly fluctuating systems with
              many degrees of freedom.  These components are (1) the theory of flocking,
              i.e., collective motion of large swarms of organisms that attempt to follow
              their neighbors; (2) ordering of liquid crystals in a random media such as
              aerogels; (3) sliding phases in magnets, crystals, and DNA complexes; (4) live
              membranes such as biological membranes with ionic pumps; and, (5) mixed
              diffusion models of the transport of certain enzymes along DNA strands.

This renewal award continues support of theoretical research in the
              physics of soft condensed matter-that is, materials such as polymers and liquid
              crystals (used, e.g., in video displays).  The central focus of the research is
              on problems involving strong fluctuation effects in systems with many degrees
              of freedom such as disordered, nonequilibrium, and biological systems.  This
              effort supports research on such topics as flocking-the ability of large groups
              of entities, such as birds, to change direction almost instantaneously as a
              group-as well as transport in biological systems such as cell membranes and
              enzymes along DNA strands.
