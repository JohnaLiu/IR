Biogenic sulfide profoundly affects geochemical behavior of many
              elements.  This study focuses on interactions between HS- and oxyanions of the
              elements Mo, Re, Ge, As and Sb.  In some cases soluble thioanions are formed by
              replacement of O atoms by S atoms around the core element in the presence of
              HS-.  A dramatic switch in the geochemical properties of the core element
              ensues.  The best studied example, the transformation of MoO42- to MoS42-,
              occurs abruptly at H2S(aq) = 11 3 ?M under near-equilibrium conditions.  The
              abrupt character of the transformation and marked difference in geochemical
              properties of the thioanion vs. the oxyanion have led us to describe this
              transformation as a geochemical switch (Helz et al. 1996).  Sulfide-actuated
              switches affect important geochemical properties of core elements: mobility,
              bioavailability, and chemical interactions with other solutes.  Because
              thioanions are multidentate, sulfur-donating ligands, they are expected to
              interact particularly strongly with soft metals, which include many hazardous
              metals. The environmental and biogeochemical implications of such interactions
              are still unknown.  Calibrating the action points of switches will enhance the
              use of trace elements as paleoredox indicators.  The chief goal is production
              of the kinds of fundamental data needed in geochemical models to predict
              behavior of elements in reducing environments.
