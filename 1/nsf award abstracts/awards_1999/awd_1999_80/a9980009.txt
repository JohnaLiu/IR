Abstract    :
              The goal of TalkBank is the creation of a distributed, web-based,
              data
archiving system for transcribed video and audio data on
              communicative
interactions. These interactions will include mothers talking
              with their
children, family dinner table talk, classroom interactions, animal
              cries,
signed language, formal debates, phone calls, talk with foreigners,
              club
meetings, and dozens of other types of communicative interactions.  The
              data
will come from speakers of many languages, professions, and ages. 
              Some
speakers will have language disabilities and some will be language
              learners.
The formal specification for data in TalkBank will use a system
              called Codon.
Tools will be created for the entry of new and existing data
              into the Codon
format; transcriptions will be linked to speech and video; and
              there will be
extensive support for collaborative commentary from competing
              perspectives. 
Researchers will be able to locate a particular segment of an
              interaction and
immediately play that section back on their computer monitors.
              TalkBank will
facilitate comparisons across social groups, languages, and
              situations.  It
will also provide tools for working in detail on single
              populations, as well
as collaborative commentaries that test competing
              interpretations against a
constant set of data.

The initiative establishes
              an ongoing interaction between computer
scientists, linguists, psychologists,
              sociologists, political scientists,
criminologists, educators, ethologists,
              cinematographers, psychiatrists, and
anthropologists.
