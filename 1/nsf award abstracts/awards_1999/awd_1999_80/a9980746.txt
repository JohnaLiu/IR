Abstract    :
              Astronomy (11) This project is introducing modern data acquisition and image
              processing techniques as an integral part of the astronomy courses. The new
              laboratory facility consists of: two computer controlled optical telescopes of
              modest aperture (16 and 10 inches), charged coupled device cameras, an
              inexpensive fiber fed spectrograph, a heliostat (for solar observations) with
              an associated high resolution spectrograph, a small (3 m) radio telescope and
              computers for telescope control, data acquisition and analysis. This facility
              is dramatically enhancing the laboratory experience for over 300 undergraduate
              students who are participating in the astronomy laboratory courses each year.
              Students are able to obtain digital images and spectra of the Sun, planets,
              stars, nebulae and bright galaxies. This collaborative learning experience will
              concretize many of the abstract concepts covered in lectures and provide
              students with an understanding of real data. Students in elementary courses can
              collect and analyze scientifically useful data. This is providing a unique
              experience for introductory students who are non-science majors. Experiments
              are being adapted from a wide range of sources, including published and
              web-based material.
