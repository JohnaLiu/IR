Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

The project is developing a strategy using
              web-based mathematics examinations, tutoring, and advising to improve the
              retention of engineering students and address the Accreditation Board on
              Engineering and Technology (ABET) criteria for evaluating engineering programs.
               The new ABET 2000 criteria are student outcome based.

The project will have
              several important features:  1) students will be tested, advised, and tutored
              at several stages during their first three years; 2) test questions will
              frequently be presented in the context of engineering applications; 3) the
              program will be easily exportable and the software freely available; and 4)
              Native American participation in the sciences is a particular focus of the
              project.
