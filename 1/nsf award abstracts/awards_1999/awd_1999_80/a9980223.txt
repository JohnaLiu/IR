Abstract    :
              On the basis of fieldwork with native Quechua speakers in Cuzco, Peru,
we will
              construct a corpus of data concerning evidentiality and its
interactions with
              other phenomena, and then frame the results within a
formal semantic theory.
              We will investigate (i) how evidentials in
Quechua are interpreted, (ii) how
              evidential markers interact with
other semantic categories such as tense
              markers, and (iii) how the
various functions of evidential markers relate to
              each other.

The study is among the first in Quechua semantics. It
              contributes to
research on the cross-linguistic manifestation of epistemic and
              other
semantic concepts, and thus to the discovery of universal properties
of
              language.  It is also a contribution to the development of semantic
theory,
              evidentiality having been largely neglected by formal
semanticists.

The
              results will be of interest to semanticists, Quechua
anthropologists,
              philosophers of language, and to linguists and
cognitive scientists more
              generally.
