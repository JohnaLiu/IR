Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is 
              continuing its support for the work of Dr. Andrew Streitwieser of the
              Department of Chemistry of the University of California at Berkeley.  The
              research aims to extend earlier work on the equilibria and kinetics involved in
              the aggregation of lithium enolates and their reactions with organic halides,
              sulfonates, and carbonyl compounds containing activated double bonds. 
              Variables to be explored include steric effects, conjugation, added
              functionality which can coordinate with the lithium ions, solvent effects, and
              the effects of additives such as HMPA and amines.  

Research, which involves
              dilute air-sensitive solutions, will be done in a unique glove box facility,
              with a thermostated sample holder connected by quartz fiber-optic cables to an
              external computer-controlled uv/vis spectrometer.  Experiments will be
              complemented by theoretical computations.  The increased understanding expected
              to result from this work will aid synthetic chemists to devise improved ways to
              form organic molecules containing new carbon-carbon bonds.
