This CISE Combined Research-Curriculum
              Development proposal requests funds to develop a machine learning track in
              Computer Engineering M.S. and Ph.D. programs.  The machine learning track will
              be interdisciplinary and will include three new courses at the senior
              undergraduate/graduate level:  Advanced Neural Networks (CS), Dynamic
              Programming (Math), and Adaptive Critic Designs (EE).  The new courses will
              include interaction with leading industrial researchers through distance
              learning.  In addition to the new courses, there will be four laboratory
              rotations:  Computational Intelligence Laboratory (EE), Industrial Applications
              Laboratory (EE), Applied Probability Laboratory (Math), and Software
              Engineering Laboratory (CS).  For the laboratory rotation courses, the students
              will be organized in teams and directed towards real research problems with
              direct industrial relevance.  As a capstone experience, students will
              participate in a one-semester internship at a national laboratory or industrial
              facility. The PI's will concurrently be developing a textbook on Adaptive
              Critic Designs.  This project has the potential to have a significant impact. 
              It could serve as a model for the design of new interdisciplinary degree
              programs at other institutions.
