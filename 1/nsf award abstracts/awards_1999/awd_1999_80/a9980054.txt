Abstract    :
              Human gesture, speech, and gaze (GSG) function as an integrated whole, no
part
              of which may be fully understood in isolation.  Since they are not
subservient
              to each other, but spring from a 'deeper' semantic source in
the human mind,
              they provide a glimpse into the function of the mind in the
production of
              human communication.  Our multi-institutional
cross-disciplinary team will
              study this GSG nexus in two major sets of
activities.  First, there is a
              technological focus on the computation,
extraction, representation and access
              to the communicative entities
contained in multi-view video of human
              communication experiments.  This
involves video analysis, speech/signal
              processing, and web-based multimedia
databases.  Second, we have assembled six
              science projects, two each in
psycholinguistics/anthropological linguistics,
              speech and natural language
understanding, and neuropathology.  The technology
              research enables the
science projects, which in turn focus the technology
              research.  In brief
the six projects investigate: 1.  How multiple
              communication modalities may
be fused to provide cogent discourse structure,
              2.  How spatial expressions
function in languages (like Tzotzil in Chiapas
              Mexico) that apply
'absolute' orienting strategies, 3.  How GSG may be
              combined to yield more
accurate speech and natural language processing, 4. 
              How GSG may be used to
locate, and understand discourse disfluencies, 5.  How
              GSG synchronies vary
in Parkinson's disease patients, and 6.  How aphasia
              interacts with
language and culture.
