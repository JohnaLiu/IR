Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to employ non-local nuclear magnetic resonance
              (NMR) to obtain particle displacement information on several granular systems
              for comparison with theoretical predictions.  Systems will include a vertically
              oscillating container filled with granular solids, a fluidized bed, and a
              gravity driven granular flow down a vertical channel.  The motion of the
              interstitial gas will be characterized using hyperpolarized nobel-gas NMR
              (PFG-NMR), and the microscopic motion of the grains will be monitored with
              pulsed-field gradient NMR.  The PFG-NMR technique permits the measurement of
              the motion of molecules over distance scales of 100nm or greater and time
              scales of milliseconds to seconds.  Detailed predictions exist for small scale
              fluctuations as well as for larger features such as shear layers at boundaries,
              one- and two-dimensional density waves, and the gas flow pattern in
              fluidized-bed bubbles.  Because of the complexity of current models,
              simplifying assumptions must be made to obtain numerical results.  The proposed
              experiments will test the validity of the model predictions.  If successful,
              this work should lead to a better understanding of pattern formations and may
              be applied to important systems such as fluidized beds.
