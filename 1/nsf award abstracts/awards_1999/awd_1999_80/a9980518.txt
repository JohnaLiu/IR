Research is proposed to develop thermodynamic
              models for the solubility of sulfur- and chlorine-bearing phases (gasses,
              liquids and solids) in molten silicate liquids.  Emphasis will be directed
              toward naturally occurring melts of "magmatic" compositions. Results will be
              incorporated into the software package MELTS.  The proposed model for sulfur
              will include both the reduced and oxidized forms of dissolved melt species and
              will account for the solubility minimum associated with intermediate oxidation
              states.  It will also incorporate our recent studies on the solubility of
              sulfide liquids in silicate melts.  The initial goal will be development of a
              comprehensive model to predict the oxidation state of sulfur in silicate melt
              as a function of temperature, bulk composition, and oxygen/sulfur fugacity. 
              Experimental work in high-temperature, one-atmosphere gas-mixing furnaces will
              be performed to augment existing published information on both sulfur and
              chlorine solubility relations.  In parallel with these efforts, a preliminary
              thermodynamic model for solid solutions of the minerals sodalite, nosean, and
              hauyne will be developed, as these minerals represent important reservoirs of
              chlorine and sulfur in magmas of low silica activity.  Applications of this
              work will be directed at illuminating sulfur and chlorine solubility and phase
              relations in natural composition melts under geologic temperature and pressure
              conditions.
