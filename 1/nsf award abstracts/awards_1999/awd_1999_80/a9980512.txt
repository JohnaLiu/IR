Seventy-five to eighty percent of the new crust that is
              generated at the 
world's orogenic arcs in  the Cenozoic can be considered to
              belong to 
"juvenile" island or continental arcs, and such settings likely
              represent 
the major environments where new material is added to the crustal
              inventory 
of the Earth.  However, intracrustal recycling through re-melting
              of 
juvenile arc basement is virtually undetectable in such settings because
              
there is virtually no isotopic contrast using traditional isotopic tracers
              
such as O, Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopes.  Assessment of the role of intracrustal
              
recycling is critical for calculation of net crustal growth rates.  This
              
work will focus on the Re-Os isotope system, which offers an exceptional
              
means to evaluate intracrustal processing in juvenile arcs.  The motivation
              
for the proposed research lies in the recognition that basaltic magmas
              
develop extreme fractionations in Re/Os ratios, which will produce
              
radiogenic 187Os/188Os ratios that far exceed those of the mantle, over
              
periods of several to 10's of m.y.  The initial target of the proposed
              
research is the Cascade Arc, NW USA, which is an ideal place to test our
              
this hypothesis because the Quaternary centers are constructed on
              
voluminous Miocene to Pliocene mafic sequences, and interpretation of the
              
Re-Os isotope data will not be confused by a) the presence of old
              
(pre-Cenozoic) sources of Os, b) significant subducted sediment input,
and
              c) subduction of old oceanic crust.
