Abstract    :
              The proposed study will focus on how SSI interventions contribute to improved
              teaching practice and effective measures for assessing teacher practice and its
              change over time.  The three study questions are:
1. What methods can be used
              to validly assess teaching practice and its change over time?
2. How do reform
              activities resulting from district-center interaction lead to improvement in
              teaching      practice when compared to typical practice?
3.What math and
              science reform activities do districts engage in as a result of involvement
              with SSI regional     centers?
The study team will develop valid teacher
              survey strategies supported with observational and artifact data.  Data will be
              collected from approximately 30-48 teachers; it is anticipated that this study
              will generate complete sets of instructional materials from approximately 20
              math and 10 science lessons for each teacher. The data will be examined to
              identifying cross-cutting themes and to assess instructional dimensions such as
              multiple representation and deep learning.
