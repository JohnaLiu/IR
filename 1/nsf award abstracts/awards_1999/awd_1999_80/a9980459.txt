Radiometric dating of ductile shear zones has revolutionized
              understanding of fault evolution and deep-crustal processes, however use of
              radiometric methods to date brittle, near surface faulting has not been
              generally utilized, as several factors make the interpretation of the data much
              more problematic.  One of the major problems at near-surface conditions is the
              presence of mineral phases that are both detrital (primary) and authigenic
              (secondary) in origin.  Therefore, radiometric dating of such rocks typically
              results in an "age" that reflects a mixture of primary and secondary clay
              forming events.  This project will use such mixed-source age spectra along with
              methodology to determine the percentages of detrital vs. authigenic phases to
              calculate the authigenic end member age.  Results should refine this approach
              and provide preliminary field applications to several important shallow-level
              faults.
