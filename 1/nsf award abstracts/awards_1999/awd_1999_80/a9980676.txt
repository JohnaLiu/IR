Abstract    :
              	Accurately representing the dynamics of the springtime polar stratosphere is
              crucial for predicting the extent of ozone depletion and its influence over
              lower latitudes, yet general circulation models (GCMs) typically do not handle
              this aspect of the meteorology well enough to allow for a successful coupling
              of dynamics and chemistry.  The research under this award will explore some of
              the key, and as yet not well understood, dynamical processes that are involved.
               The results should ultimately lead to improvement of dynamics-photochemistry
              coupling in GCMs. 

	The co-principal investigators plan to carry out
              observational and theoretical investigations of the seasonal and interannual
              variability of the meteorological conditions of the polar stratosphere,
              focusing on understanding the dynamics of the final warming over the poles. 
              Horizontal mixing and diffusivity and the evolution of wave activity will be
              examined in an application of the quasi-Lagrangian perspective originally
              developed by Dr. Nakamura .  The co-investigators will employ several gridded
              assimilated analyses as the basis for the observational studies and also
              conduct numerical experiments with a hierarchy of idealized models.  They also
              plan to compare and contrast the evolution of the warming as it occurs in the
              Arctic and Antarctic.
