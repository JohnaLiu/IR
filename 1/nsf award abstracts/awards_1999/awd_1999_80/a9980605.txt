Basalts are our
              physical link to the mantle, which is the largest silicate domain in the earth.
               Variations in the chemical and isotopic composition of basalts may result from
              differences in their mantle sources or processes related to melting and melt
              transport.  Continental basalts, although volumetrically not significant, may
              provide unique insights into mantle melting processes. Particularly interesting
              are the processes related to the enigmatic lithospheric mantle melting and the
              role of the lithosphere during the dynamic melting of the underlying
              asthenosphere.   

Unlike long-lived isotopic systems, which provide
              time-integrated data, the short-lived uranium series isotopes may provide
              unique constraints on extent and timing of melting and melt transport.  These
              constraints are possible because the source nuclide ratios are known (equal to
              the ratio of the half-lives of the nuclides in any chain) and the half-lives
              are of time-scales appropriate for mantle melting and transport.  The two
              important uranium-series isotopic systems for the study of mantle melting are
              230Th-238U and 231Pa-235U.  The 231Pa-235U system can be a powerful complement
              to the more-developed 230Th-238U method once we gain understanding of the ways
              in which 231Pa and 235U behave during melting.  At the present there are very
              few 231Pa-235U data on basalts.  We expect results from this project will
              enlarge our understanding of 231Pa-235U fractionation during melting and melt
              transport.  In addition to whole-rock data, we will obtain mineral/matrix Pa
              data.  At the present there are no mineral/melt partitioning data for Pa. 
              Uranium-series isotopic data from this project will provide important
              constraints for melting and magma transport models.
