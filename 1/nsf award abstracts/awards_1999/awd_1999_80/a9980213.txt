The aims of this project are to evaluate experimentally the
              mechanical behavior of FCC and BCC nanocrystalline metals and to develop
              mechanistic deformation models for various grain size regimes.  The deformation
              and failure mechanisms of pure Ni, Ni-Cu and Fe-Ni alloys are studied by
              characterizing yielding, strain hardening, plastic instability, and fracture as
              functions of temperature and strain rate.  Analysis of such results in
              conjunction with detailed microstructural analyses should lead to a systematic
              understanding of the operating mechanisms.  Some alloy variations are examined.
               When copper is added to nickel the stacking fault energy is reduced
              significantly, thereby affecting the generation and accumulation of
              dislocations.  A small increase in the concentration of nickel in Fe-Ni alloys
              results in a change of crystal structure from BCC to FCC.  In this way, the
              effect of crystal structure can be investigated at comparable compositions.

Despite an expansion of research in the past decade on nanostructured
              metallic alloys, there have been few experimental studies that investigate the
              mechanical properties of these materials.  Metallic solids with crystallite
              sizes less than approximately 100nm are referred to as nanocrystalline metals. 
              These materials have attractive properties, including very high strength
              levels.  The outcome of this research will contribute to the development of
              metallic structures that are as strong as hardened steels (700 - 1800 MPa) but
              have better physical properties (e.g. magnetic properties) and superior
              corrosion resistance.
