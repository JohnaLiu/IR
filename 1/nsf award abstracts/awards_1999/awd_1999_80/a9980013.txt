Abstract    :
              Research shows that seeing another person when talking to them does little to
              improve conversation, but seeing the objects being talked about  helps a great
              deal.  In various ways, the shared visual environment leads to the development
              of common ground--the detailed mutual understanding among participants about
              what each knows at any moment. The primary goals of this research are to
              understand more completely the role of shared visual spaces in both
              face-to-face and mediated settings, to discover how the usefulness of visual
              information interacts with tasks and participants, and to identify ways in
              which video-based systems can truly support remote collaborative work.  The
              outcomes will be (1) theoretical understanding of the attributes of shared
              visual spaces that support conversational grounding and thus task performance, 
              (2)  detailed knowledge about the parameters that make a difference in visual
              communication systems for working on complex, collaborative tasks; and (3)
              technology that allows the accurate estimation of the focus of attention in
              distributed settings. If successful, the research will provide a scientific
              basis for the design of communication systems for such distributed activities
              as telemedicine, distributed education, and staffing of help desks for
              repair.
