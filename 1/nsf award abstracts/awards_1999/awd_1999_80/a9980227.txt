This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              in electrical and communication systems involves Jessy Grizzle, a graduate
              student from the University of Michigan, Claude Moog, Christine Chevallereux of
              the Institut de Recherche de Cybernetique, Nantes, France, and Franck Plestan
              of the University Louis Pasteur.  The project, supported under a program of the
              National Science Foundation and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS), will facilitate collaboration on automatic control of
              biped-walking robots.  The investigators will focus on issues related to
              analytical methodology for designing these robots.  The research builds on
              previous mathematical analysis of a periodic walking cycle of an under
              actuated, five degree of freedom biped robot, consisting of two rigid legs and
              a torso, but no knees.  This research will extend the analysis to design of
              asymptotically stable walking motions for an under actuated, seven degree of
              freedom biped robot.  It takes advantage of access to a 1.425 m biped robot,
              complete with a torso and knees, that has been developed by the French
              team.

The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
              nonlinear control analysis and design.  This is complemented by the experience
              and experimental testbed of the French team.  The studies will advance our
              understanding of the analytical methodology involved in nonlinear control of
              robots and its potential for improving locomotion in rough terrain and uses in
              prosthesis development and testing.
