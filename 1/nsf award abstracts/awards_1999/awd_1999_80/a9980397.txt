	Over 70 years ago, rich dinosaur faunas were discovered
              in Mongolia.  These were the first dinosaurs for which eggs and nest were
              found.  Since then, our understanding of dinosaur behavior and habitats has
              been greatly increased as a result of the past 70 years of works in Mongolia by
              Polish, Russian, Japanese, and North American research teams.  The age of the
              Mongolian dinosaurs, however, has remained uncertain.  The rocks necessary for
              radiometric ages dates are not present in the dinosaur-bearing sediments, so
              age dates have proven impossible to obtain.  Originally these dinosaurs were
              thought to be ancestral to Campanian and Maastrichtian (ca. 83-65 million year
              old) North American forms; later it was suggested that perhaps the Mongolian
              dinosaurs were closer in time to the North American dinosaurs.  This project
              will perform paleomagnetic analysis on rock samples in order to place the
              dinosaur fauna of Mongolia into a higher resolution chronostratigraphic
              framework. PI's best estimate at present place the Mongolian dinosaur faunas as
              Campanian in age (ca. 80 million years old).
