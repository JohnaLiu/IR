Abstract    :
              The proposed research will test the validity of IA models for atmospheric
              composition by comparing global chemical modes in the IA model with those
              identified in a reference model, i.e., the global 3-D Chemistry-Transport
              Models available at UC Irvine and Lawrence Livermore National Lab. These
              chemical modes are the eigenvectors of the linearized continuity equations for
              the complete set of independent variables and describe the decay of
              perturbation of the system. They are key diagnostic of the combined influence
              of multiple systems. This research will explicitly calculate all the
              chemistry-climate modes of some IA models and compare them with the long-lived
              modes diagnosed from detailed atmospheric models upon which the IA models are
              based. This is an objective way of analyzing IA models for long-lived, or even
              unstable, perturbations to the greenhouse gas-climate system. The work is
              important because it will identify modes that couple across the
              biosphere-chemistry-climate system in IA models.
