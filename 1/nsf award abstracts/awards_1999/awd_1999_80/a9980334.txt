CRCD:  An Interactive Curriculum in
              Human Language Technology for Undergraduate and Graduate Education and
              Research

This Combined Research-Curriculum Development proposal requests
              funds to develop a comprehensive curriculum of courses to train advanced
              undergraduate and beginning graduate students to understand, use, and develop
              human language technologies and systems.  The curriculum will include courses
              in six departments: Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Linguistics,
              Psychology, Speech Hearing & Language Sciences and Communication.  The courses
              are grouped into three general areas: Foundations of Speech and Language,
              Language and Speech Technologies, and Designing and Using Interactive Language
              Systems.  Courses in each of these areas combine classroom and laboratory
              components and rely on state-of-the-art tools and technologies within the CSLU
              Toolkit, a portable software platform supporting research and education in
              human language technology.  The new courses will be developed in collaboration
              with faculty from Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford University and the
              University of California-Santa Cruz.  The courses will be disseminated widely
              via the Internet and CD-ROM.
