Many species remain distinct by not mating with one
              another.  One popular but controversial evolutionary theory, called
              reinforcement, suggests that individuals who mate with individuals of another
              species will often produce sterile hybrids, so natural selection directly
              favors genetic factors that confer strong mate choice.  Few convincing
              experimental cases of reinforcement have been documented, though, and
              mathematical theories that try to estimate how often it occurs lack information
              on its genetic basis.  This project will be the first to study the genetic
              basis of reinforcement, and it will do so in the North American fruit fly
              Drosophila pseudoobscura.  Markers have been developed throughout the genome of
              this species, and it cultures readily in the laboratory, so it is highly
              amenable to such a study.  The results of this work will then provide the
              genetic parameters necessary for realistic mathematical models of this process,
              and it will be generally informative with regard to the genetic basis of
              behaviors that evolve as a product of natural selection.

Modern evolutionary
              biologists have an impressive understanding of how genes evolve within
              populations, but a relatively poor understanding of how one species splits into
              two. This research will illuminate the mechanisms of speciation, providing
              insights into the fundamental evolutionary processes that regulate biodiversity
              on earth.
