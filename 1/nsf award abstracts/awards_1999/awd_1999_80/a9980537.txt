Abstract    :
              This award to Educause provides support for a series of activities designed to
              enable minority-serving institutions to prepare for and then participate in
              national advanced networking initiatives, including Internet2 and NGI. 
              Included are workshops and training programs intended to assist administrators
              in devising technology strategies and financing plans for their institutions. 
              Similar programs will develop the human support infrastructure in these
              colleges and universities.  Yet other activites are aimed at preparing the
              faculty and students in the use of the high performance networks.   An
              important aspect of this latter array of activities is the involvement of the
              Education, Outreach, and Training (EOT) program that is part of NSF's
              Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (PACI).  Coupled with
              and integral to all of these programs and activities will be experiments with
              and prototypes of advanced, innovative network technologies for Internet access
              or for vBNS or Abilene access.  In particular, these advanced technologies will
              seek to attack the problems of cost and access for locations that have limited
              telecommunications options.
