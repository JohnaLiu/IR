Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) The major objective of this project is to introduce affordable,
              modern nuclear magnetic resonance technology into the chemistry curriculum at
              all levels and to use this to improve conceptual understanding of the very
              important area of NMR spectroscopy.  This is accomplished by upgrading an older
              continuous wave NMR spectrometer (EM360A) to an FT-NMR instrument using the
              currently popular and proven Anasazi technology.  This hardware/software
              upgrade modernizes the instrument and extends its capability to 2D experiments
              and to other nuclei, including C-13, P-31, and F-l9.  HyperNMR, a molecular
              modeling add-on to existing departmental software, allows for the computation
              of chemical shifts, splitting constants, and NMR spectra for a variety of
              nuclei.  The fundamentals of NMR are introduced in 100-level and 200-level
              courses (General, Organic) for science majors, including nursing and allied
              health students.  At that level, the focus is on proton decoupled C-13 NMR,
              with at least one experiment in each course to illustrate the use of NMR in
              molecular structure analysis. The pedagogical advantage this offers over the
              traditional H- 1 NMR approach is the simplicity of interpretation of C-13 NMR. 
              In subsequent courses, NMR concepts are extended to include proton spectra, the
              concept of spin-spin splitting, the use of DEPT to distinguish types of carbons
              in C-13 NMR, 2-D techniques, and the use of other nuclei such as P-31.
              Molecular modeling relates observed C-13 shifts to computed charges on the
              atoms, and allows the computation of spectra. The experiments chosen to be
              implemented in this project are adaptations and enhancements of experiments
              documented in the chemical educational literature (primarily the J. Chemical
              Education), and in textbooks.  In a unique partnership, students compare their
              C-13 and H-1 60 MHz spectra with spectra from a neighboring university with a
              larger 300 MHz instrument and/or with spectra available on the Internet. 
              Significant comparative results are posted to the department's WEB page. This
              integrated approach to NMR concepts is having a substantial impact on the
              curriculum locally and can serve as a model for programs at other small
              institutions who are interested in strengthening their NMR curriculum.   The
              evaluation/assessment activities of this project  are facilitated by an
              external consultant with expertise in this area.
