Abstract    :
              While the educational technology community has produced some software that does
              indeed provide the necessary support, there is no systematic body of design
              guidelines that are empirically assessed that developers can draw on, and that
              other researchers can build on.  What is needed, then, is a
              theoretically-rationalized, empirically-justified set of finely-articulated
              design guidelines for constructing computational scaffolds and supports that
              enable children to use computational tools as they carry out a science inquiry.
               A multidisciplinary team of researchers from the University of Michigan,
              Northwestern University, Southern Illinois University, Western Illinois
              University, and Pennsylvania State University propose a three-year effort to
              produce such a catalog of learning-situated design guidelines (LSDG).  As well,
              we propose creating software components (JavaBeans) that instantiate some of
              those guidelines; we propose making these components available as open source
              software, and contributing them to various online educational component
              libraries.
