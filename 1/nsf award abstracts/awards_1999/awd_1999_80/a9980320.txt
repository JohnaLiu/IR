Abstract    :
              The Department of Geography at Northern Illinois University seeks the addition
              of a new Pentium III server, six Pentium II PCs, a network switch an
              dhigh-volume printer to increase th reliability of t he meteorology computer
              network and thus assist the department in meeting its various internal and
              external computer needs.  Continuous weather information must be acquired, made
              availbale, and stored for students working toward an undergraduate degree in
              meteorology; faculty developing and conducting research in areas of
              micrometeorology, applied climatology, and forecast verification; and other
              institutions that rely on NIU as a node for UNIDATA's Internet Data
              Distribution.
