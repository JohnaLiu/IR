              ABSTRACT
EEC-9980423
STRAUSS

Forests are major sources for producing
              structural, fiber, chemical and energy products.  In addition, their value for
              carbon sequestration, wildlife habitat and maintenance of air and water will
              grow substantially in the future.  However, because of their long life cycle
              and delayed production, the productivity of industrial forest products is
              considerably slowed.  There is an urgent need for intensely managed
              short-rotation tree plantations.  Genetic technology can improve forest
              productivity and therefore will have major national and international economic
              impact. 

The I/UCRC's research agenda will address 1.) Flowering control,
              2.) Transformation and 3.) Verification resistance.
