Intrusion of large sill-like magma bodies plays a major
              role in the accretion of the Earth's crust and ultimately in the chemical
              differentiation of the lithosphere. However, the particular mechanisms that
              control initiation, emplacement, and termination of horizontal magma sheets are
              poorly understood.  Major outstanding problems include the relative importance
              of ambient stresses and rock strength anisotropy in governing sill initiation
              and growth, the relationships between sills, feeder dikes, and magma source
              regions, the character and extent of inelastic deformation accompanying sill
              emplacement, and intrusion-induced seismicity. This project aims to develop a
              detailed quantitative understanding of individual underplating events by
              solving boundary value problems of solid mechanics that explicitly include
              realistic variations in the host rock properties, effects of the free surface,
              and inelastic deformation of the host based on reasonable failure laws. The
              investigators will gain further insight into the dynamics of sill-like
              intrusions by performing physical analog experiments in collaboration with the
              Department of Experimental Tectonophysics of Kiev Institute of Geophysics
              (Kiev, Ukraine). This work will be directly relevant to interpretations of
              seismicity in the regions of the inferred contemporaneous sill-like magma
              bodies. By using satellite radar interferometry (InSAR), surface deformation
              will be measured in the area of Socorro, New Mexico, where anomalous
              mid-crustal reflector and geodetic uplift have been interpreted as indicating
              the presence of magma at depth. The investigators will invert the observed
              deformation to constrain the geometry of the inferred magma body and the
              dynamics of magma supply.
