The determination of the rates of
              geologic processes is fundamental to earth history, yet precise quantification
              of rates in many geologic settings has been very difficult to achieve.  Partly
              due to greatly improved analytical precision, rates of magma chamber
              construction, strain rates during emplacement and rates of heating and cooling
              of plutons and wall rocks can be approached.  This project will focus on the
              well-exposed crystalline core of the North Cascades to constrain the time
              scales and rates of pluton emplacement, deformation and exhumation and will
              involve an extensive, high-precision age dating program.  Results should
              illuminate several important temporal and spatial variations in magmatic and
              deformational processes in deep levels of continental magmatic arcs.
