Abstract    :
              The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) is a relic left over from the
              early universe and it has its origin in the "big bang" in which the universe
              that we live in was created.  The variations in brightness on the sky of the
              CMBR carry the imprint of the distribution of matter about 300,000 years after
              creation and the linear polarization of the CMBR can provide information from
              even earlier times, just a fraction of a second after creation.  This award
              provides support for the on-going analysis of CMBR data obtained by an
              Antarctic long-duration balloon flight in 1998-99, for the development of
              modifications for the earlier payload to measure polarization and for another
              Antarctic flight.  The research team doing this work is probably the leading
              group in the world for the field.
