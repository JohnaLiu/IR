Abstract    :
                 Despite advances in computer-controlled automation, the technological
              capabilities of robotic and 'smart' instruments are still far exceeded by the
              human brain.  The next generation of intelligent devices will need to combine
              features such as the perceptual abilities, high learning rates and capability
              of generalization shown by the brain.  To clarify a fundamental component of
              intelligent behavior, this project studies how cellular interactions within the
              cerebral cortex of the brain underlie problem-solving strategies in behaving
              primates.  New technologies will be used for recording brain activity, for
              designing microchips, and for pattern recognition analysis.  The objectives are
              to characterize the learning methods used to map sensory cues (from sight,
              sound and touch) into relevant motor behaviors (directed arm movements), to see
              how different learning strategies affect the dynamic relations among functional
              associations of groups of cortical nerve cells during learning, and to design a
              brain-machine interface that will sample and process neuronal activity in real
              time in behaving animals.  Technological goals include the use of a special
              virtual reality environment for behavioral testing, the development of a
              wireless multichannel microchip for transmitting brain activity to a remote
              receiver, and the development of pattern-recognition algorithms to analyze
              complex patterns of brain activity among multiple cells.
   Results of this
              project from the Knowledge and Distributed Intelligence (KDI) initiative will
              have broad impact on fields such as neurobiology, bioengineering and computer
              science, will have potential applications in technology for intelligent
              interactive roboticsm, and will provide excellent cross-disciplinary training
              for a range of students and postdoctoral researchers.
