The investigators propose to obtain a
              better understanding of the structure, evolution and processes of the Earth's
              core through computations of the atomic-scale physics of iron and iron alloys. 
              In this renewal, they will build on the achievements of prior research by
              applying fast and efficient methods, developed during earlier grant periods, to
              problems important to high-pressure geophysics, in particular to the
              computation of accurate high temperature properties.  A variety of electronic
              structure methods that are more efficient than the all electron
              linearized-augmented-plane-wave (LAPW) method will be used in high temperature
              calculations, including a projector mixed-basis method and a total energy
              tight-binding model. Statistical mechanical methods will include: 1) The
              particle in a cell model, which permits rapid calculation of equilibrium
              thermodynamic properties including anharmonic terms, and 2) Ab initio molecular
              dynamics which allows calculations of equilibrium properties, as well as
              transport and defect properties. The treatment of magnetism at high temperature
              will receive special attention because this is important in the relatively
              low-pressure regime (<1 Mbar) where most experimental data exist.  The
              investigators will investigate a number of areas that are important to our
              understanding of the earth's inner and outer core including: 1) the sub-solidus
              phase diagram of iron; 2) the elasticity of solid iron at high temperature and
              high pressure; 3) the formation of vacancies and diffusion in solid iron at low
              and high pressures; 4) extended defects and rheology; 5) the melting curve of
              iron; 6) the equilibrium and transport properties of liquid iron including
              anelastic properties; and 7) the effect of alloying elements (including Ni, O,
              S, C and H) on the physics of liquid and solid iron.
