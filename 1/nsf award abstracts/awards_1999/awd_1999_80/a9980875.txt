Abstract    :
              Surface micro-electromechanical technology will be scaled to deep ultrasonic
              frequencies (~10-100 MHz) and integrated with ultra-low-power Si CMOS readout
              electronics to develop sub-centimeter sized, two-dimensional transmit/receive
              arrays that can be inserted in the mouth and coupled acoustically to individual
              teeth for the purpose of three-dimensional volumetric imaging. This project
              will extend the science of ultra-high-frequency acoustics and the technology of
              ultrasonic/electronic integration, consistent with the objectives of the
              'XYZ-on-a-Chip' Program. It will take advantage of the low-power digital signal
              processing and image processing technologies currently being developed in other
              fields (e.g., wireless communications). Finally, it will enable a
              revolutionary, non-ionizing capability in dental imaging that promises to
              detect many important effects that conventional radiography usually miss (e.g.,
              micro-cracks in teeth and carious lesions under existing restorations), and
              eliminate the environmental problems associated with medical radiography.
