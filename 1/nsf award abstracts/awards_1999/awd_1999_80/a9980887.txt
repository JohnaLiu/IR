Abstract    :
              Engineering - Civil (54) The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering
              at Rowan University is adapting Sooner City for use in its undergraduate
              program. Sooner City, developed at the University of Oklahoma, is a digital
              city that students use to complete design-oriented assignments. It provides an
              integrated four-year design project that unifies the curriculum, allowing
              material learned in earlier courses to carry forward and to be built upon. This
              is in contrast to the "traditional" paradigm in which courses often stand as
              independent entities. The goal of the current effort is to adapt Sooner City at
              Rowan University and to develop effective adaptation methods that will assist
              other institutions wishing to do the same. The objectives are to: 1) Implement
              Sooner City at Rowan University, under the name "Garden City"; 2) Develop a
              computer-based adaptation wizard for use by other institutions; 3) Add design
              elements not already developed by OU; 4) Evaluate results both to improve
              Sooner and Garden Cities and to ensure that future adaptation of Sooner City
              will be as efficient and effective as possible; and 5) Disseminate the results
              to encourage wide adaptation of Sooner City.
