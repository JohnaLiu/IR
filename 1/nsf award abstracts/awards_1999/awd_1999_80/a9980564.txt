This project will develop three high-resolution
              paleoseismologic trench sites on the central and eastern North Anatolian fault
              (NAF) in northern Turkey.  These data will be used to begin construction of a
              space-time history of seismic moment release along the NAF during the past
              several thousand years (5 to 10 earthquake cycles).  The space-time history
              will in turn be used to test various competing models of earthquake occurrence,
              with the ultimate goal of either supporting or rejecting basic claims about the
              physical mechanisms underlying these patterns.  For example, do large
              earthquakes occur randomly in time, or are they quasi-periodic?  Do ruptures
              tend to initiate and terminate at the same locations time after time?  Do large
              earthquakes cluster in time?  As yet, such paleoseismologic data sets exist for
              only a few faults around the world (e.g., Wahsatch and San Andreas).  For
              scientific and logistical reasons, the NAF is one of the world's best faults on
              which to undertake such studies.  The great length (1500 km), large cumulative
              slip (90 km), and rapid slip rate (~20 mm/yr) demonstrate that the NAF is
              comparable to other major continental strike-slip fault systems.
