Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Central Florida for the support
              of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) project entitled,
              "Combined Research-Curriculum Development and Optical Networking," under the
              direction of Dr. Guifang Li. The goal of this three year program is to develop
              a series of courses in fiber-optic communications with an aim of not only
              increasing the number but also improving the quality of the skilled workforce
              entering the fiber-optic communication industry.  In particular, the objectives
              are: 1) Fill a void in quality and up-to-date optical fiber communication
              educaton at both the upper undergraduate and introductory graduate level by
              developing four courses by incorporating the latest knowledge and techology
              base. 2)Design, test, and refine course content and delivery methods to a
              diverse audience employing appropriate learning theory and instructional
              technologies. 3) Design ways to institutionalize the courses into existing
              curriculum. 4) Dissemination of the course materials on a national scale.
