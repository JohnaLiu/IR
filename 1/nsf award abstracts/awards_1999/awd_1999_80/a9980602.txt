Abstract    :

The investigators propose to obtain a better understanding of
              the structure, evolution and processes of the Earth's core through computations
              of the atomic-scale physics of iron and iron alloys.  In this renewal, they
              will build on the achievements of prior research by applying fast and efficient
              methods, developed during earlier grant periods, to problems important to
              high-pressure geophysics, in particular to the computation of accurate high
              temperature properties.  A variety of electronic structure methods that are
              more efficient than the all electron linearized-augmented-plane-wave (LAPW)
              method will be used in high temperature calculations, including a projector
              mixed-basis method and a total energy tight-binding model. Statistical
              mechanical methods will include: 1) The particle in a cell model, which permits
              rapid calculation of equilibrium thermodynamic properties including anharmonic
              terms, and 2) Ab initio molecular dynamics which allows calculations of
              equilibrium properties, as well as transport and defect properties. The
              treatment of magnetism at high temperature will receive special attention
              because this is important in the relatively low-pressure regime (<1 Mbar) where
              most experimental data exist.  The investigators will investigate a number of
              areas that are important to our understanding of the earth's inner and outer
              core including: 1) the sub-solidus phase diagram of iron; 2) the elasticity of
              solid iron at high temperature and high pressure; 3) the formation of vacancies
              and diffusion in solid iron at low and high pressures; 4) extended defects and
              rheology; 5) the melting curve of iron; 6) the equilibrium and transport
              properties of liquid iron including anelastic properties; and 7) the effect of
              alloying elements (including Ni, O, S, C and H) on the physics of liquid and
              solid iron.
