CRCD:  Real-Time Embedded
              Systems Research and Curriculum Development

This CISE Combined
              Research-Curriculum Development proposal requests funds to develop new courses
              specifically designed for real-time embedded systems research and practice. 
              The embedded systems curriculum consists of four courses at the upper
              undergraduate/beginning graduate level.  The four courses are Real-time
              Embedded Systems Fundamentals, Real-time Embedded Systems I, Real-time Embedded
              Systems II, and Applied Research in Real-time Embedded Systems.  To optimize
              time spent by students in the laboratory, each student will be provided with a
              virtual laboratory on CD-ROM.  The virtual laboratory will include multimedia
              presentations of the lecture material from class, extensive reference material,
              a microkernel simulator, and software to simulate various parts of an embedded
              system.  With the proliferation of electronic components in modern equipment,
              the need for real-time embedded systems research and education is real, and
              this project could make a significant impact in that arena.
