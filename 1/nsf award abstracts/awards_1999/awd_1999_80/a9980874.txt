Microactuation by Electrical Control of
              Surface Tension

The goal of this Engineering Microsystems: "XYZ" on a Chip
              project is to establish surface tension as a main source of force for moving
              liquid media in microdevices. Surface tension dominates most conventional
              forces as things scale down to micrometers. Encouraged by the recent success of
              liquid micromotors, which have demonstrated unprecedented efficiency in terms
              of requiring both low driving voltage and low energy consumption,
              electrowetting (EW) is proposed as a more general and direct mechanism upon
              which to base surface-tension microactuation for microdevice liquid movement.
              The main goal of this project is to establish the foundation of science and
              fabrication technology for EW-based microactuation. A plan to study, develop,
              and characterize this new microactuation mechanism is described. The targeted
              result is a highly energy-efficient yet simple and practical liquid-driving
              method for microscale fluidic devices. for This technology will find numerous
              applications in chemical and biomedical microdevices. A prototype DNA printhead
              actuated by the EW mechanism will be developed to both demonstrate the
              technology and to illustrate some of the potential impact to be realized by the
              fundamental microactuation advances proposed in this study.
