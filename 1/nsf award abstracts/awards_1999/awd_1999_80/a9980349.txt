The investigators will determine the nature of
              the connection between recurrent, localized flashes of Calcium-II emission in
              the solar chromosphere and the underlying magnetohydrodynamics of the
              photosphere. Hydrodynamic models of stellar atmospheres suggest that these
              "cell flashes" are a product of shocks generated by seismic events in the
              photosphere. The main effort is to use magnetograms and other optical
              observations made at Big Bear Solar Observatory to investigate the relationship
              of the flashes to magnetic fields in the quiet solar chromosphere. A series of
              spatially co-registered images of Iron emission from the Vacuum Tower Telescope
              at Sacramento Peak Observatory will be used to map acoustic surges, which are a
              type of seismic event previously identified. By comparing observed locations
              and times of acoustic surges and cell flashes the investigators will look for
              evidence of a spatial and temporal correlations between the two phenomena.
