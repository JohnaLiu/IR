Abstract    :
                  This research project consists of field stidues to examine the chemical
              heterogeneity among fog drop populations and the effects this heterogeneity
              exerts on aerosol and trace gas processing.  The project involves the first
              deployments of two new cloud/fog samplers designed to provide better resolution
              of drop composition as a function of drop size.  These samplers provide 3-stage
              droplet collection in supercooled clouds and 5-stage collection in warm clouds
              and fogs.  The new multi-stage collectors will be deployed to measure drop
              size-resolved fog composition in two major field campaigns: in winter 2000/01
              during the California Regional PM10/PM2.5 Air Quality Study (CRPAQS) intensive
              in the San Joaquin Valley and in winter 2001/02 in a study of aerosol
              processing by fogs in Denver's Brown Cloud. Results from both studies will
              represent a considerable advance in understanding of how fog drop composition
              varies across the drop size spectrum and the influence of this variation on
              aerosol formation (via gas uptake and aqueous sulfur oxidation) and removal
              (via drop deposition).  The CRPAQS study will also provide the first good
              opportunity to test the ability of size-resolved fog chemistry models to
              accurately predict the size-dependent chemical composition of fogs.  A new
              2-stage stainless steel fog sampler will also be developed and deployed in both
              field campaigns.  This instrument will provide the first reliable information
              about the distribution of organic carbon across the drop size spectrum and its
              influence on the ability of urban fogs to cleanse the atmosphere of organic
              aerosol particles by scavenging and deposition.
