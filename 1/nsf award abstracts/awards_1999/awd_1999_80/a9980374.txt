This proposal is for study of carbonic fluid generation
              and transport in the Black Hills, South Dakota during Proterozoic metamorphism
              associated with the Trans-Hudson continental collision.  The aim is to
              determine the composition and mass of fluids generated during prograde
              metamorphism of graphitic metapelitic from biotite to second sillimanite grade
              and to determine the pathways for expulsion of the fluids.  Generation of
              carbon-bearing fluids during metamorphism of graphitic metapelites has received
              little attention compared to fluids generated by calc-silicate reactions, even
              though phase equilibria predicts that the metamorphic fluids must contain a
              significant carbonic component. The study will include XRD, Raman
              spectroscopic, and isotopic analysis of disseminated and fluid-deposited
              graphite over the range of grades, and will also include microthermometric, Ram
              spectroscopic, and stable isotope analysis of fluid inclusions in veins.  The
              results will be interpreted in view of metamorphic reactions in the Black
              Hills, published graphite-fluid phase equilibria, and isotopic fractionations.
              The study will lead to a comprehensive model of carbonic fluid production and
              egress during regional metamorphic events associated with continental
              collisions. It will provide better understanding and quantification of the
              contribution of regional metamorphism to the global carbon cycle.
