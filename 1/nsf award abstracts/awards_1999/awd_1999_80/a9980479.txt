"Chocolate!" is a travelling 4,500 sq. ft. exhibit developed
              and produced by the Field Museum of Chicago.  The visitor is invited on a
              journey through time, where they can explore the interactions between humans
              and ecosystems, and discover how cultures have shaped -- and have been shaped
              by -- this gift of nature, chocolate.  The exhibition and its associated
              programs will promote awareness of the process natural products undergo as they
              are integrated into our lives, and will encourage the visitor to question how
              cultural traditions, people, and the environment are intertwined.

The
              exhibition consists of four (4) areas.  Exploring the cacao tree (Threobroma
              cacao) beginning with its ecological requirements (Bounty from Nature's
              Garden), its practical and ritual use by Mesoamerican societies (Food of the
              Gods), its introduction to Europe several hundred years ago (Bitter Seeds of
              Sweet Success), and finally its important role in international markets today
              (Where Money Grows on Trees) will all be highlighted.  Throughout the entire
              exhibition, connections between natural ecosystems and human cultures will be
              reinforced within the context of contemporary conservation issues.

The
              "Chocolate!" exhibition and programs will tour North America, coordinated by
              SITES and reaching 1,000,000 visitors over three (3) years.  In addition, a
              website will ensure long-term public and classroom access to the educational
              materials related to cacao and chocolate.
