Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)

This project builds a robotics laboratory and provides
              integrated experiences in the undergraduate computer science curriculum through
              new courses and modified course experiences. It adapts aspects of existing
              exemplary projects at MIT and Swarthmore College as appropriate to meet the
              local needs. The undergraduate robotics laboratory enables undergraduate
              computer science majors to study, design and implement control algorithms for
              autonomous robots as well as to explore techniques for object recognition and
              manipulation. It also permits robotics to be introduced to lower division
              majors through a lab using a robotics simulator and to majors in artificial
              intelligence through a lab that enables an integrated planning and natural
              language processing system to control a robot. The lab supports a survey course
              on human and artificial intelligence designed for non-majors, a course that
              will form part of a three-course sequence on cognitive science. Most students
              overestimate the capabilities and intelligence of robots and computers. By
              permitting them to study control algorithms for low-level behaviors, they gain
              an understanding of what robots and computers can and cannot do and an
              appreciation of the contribution computer science has made to the study of
              human intelligence.
