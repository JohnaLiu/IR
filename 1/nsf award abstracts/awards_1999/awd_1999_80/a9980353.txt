Abstract    :
              Steroid hormones elicit responses in many target tissues by binding to specific
              receptors on the cell surface.  However, lack of information on the structures
              of these steroid membrane receptors and their genes has prevented significant
              progress in our understanding of this mechanism of steroid hormone action. 
              Recently a novel gene has been identified in spotted seatrout ovaries which
              appears to have the characteristics of an estrogen membrane receptor.  The goal
              of this project is to complete the characterization of this putative estrogen
              membrane receptor, including its binding to steroids, localization in estrogen
              target tissues, activation of cellular responses, and regulation.  This is a
              high risk project because it will not be known if the novel seatrout gene is a
              functional estrogen membrane receptor until all the research objectives have
              been completed.  It is probable that a knowledge of the structure of the
              seatrout estrogen membrane receptor can be used to identify steroid membrane
              receptors in other species, including humans.  Therefore the identification of
              the first steroid membrane receptor gene and knowledge of its structure is
              likely to have a major impact in many areas of biology and medicine including
              endocrinology, psychiatry, immunology, cancer, and reproductive disorders.
