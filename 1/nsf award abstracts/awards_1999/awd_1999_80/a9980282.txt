Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
              University for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD)
              project entitled, "Innovative Combined Curriculum and Research Experience for
              the Design of Microelectronic Devices, Processes, and Manufacturing
              Operations," under the direction of Dr. Robert W. Hendricks.  This project
              teams faculty from various disciplines at Virginia Tech to develop an
              innovative combined  curriculum and research experience for the design of
              microelectronics devices, processes and manufacturing operations which
              integrates current research from various areas of microelectronics
              manufacturing. The principal investigators for this proposal will draw on
              research expertise in the fields of power semiconductor devices and power ICs,
              packaging, VLSI design, nanofabrication technology, electronic ceramics, and
              operational control of manufacturing processes.  A three course core is
              proposed to level the bacground  of entering students from various disciplines
              in the microelectronics manufacturing option.  In addition, three tracks for
              advanced study are proposed in the areas of devices, nanofabrication, and
              manufacturing/operations planning.
