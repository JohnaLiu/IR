The Exploratorium will design, build and travel an exhibition
              on human memory called "Memory:  A Traveling Exhibition."  This
              3,000-square-foot exhibition will approach human memory from biological,
              cognitive, personal and cultural perspectives.  "Memory: A Traveling
              Exhibition" will be a smaller, moveable version of a successful exhibition at
              the Exploratorium in 1998.  A recent boom in scientific research dealing with
              memory has generated a corresponding need for science centers to inform the
              public about the nature and significance of findings.  This exhibition will be
              designed to increase the public's awareness of the extent, importance and
              nature of their memories, as well as their understanding of how cognitive
              scientists study the mind.  The exhibition will travel to science centers
              across the nation.
