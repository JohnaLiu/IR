This SGER proposal is designed to train a graduate
              student in the technique of Preisach-Bose-Einstein modeling of magnetic
              aftereffect in magnetic recording media.  This type of analysis determines the
              superparamagnetic limit of this medium.  It is vital to the recording industry
              as the resolution limit is approached to be able to ascertain that the
              degradation of performance with time is within acceptable limits.
