Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)

An interdisciplinary team from the Departments of
              Chemical Engineering, Mathematics, and Curriculum and Instruction is designing
              and creating an interactive, Internet-based tutorial resource that is teaching
              chemical engineering students how to statistically design and analyze
              experiments. The tutorial is being collaboratively produced with ongoing
              testing and evaluation during the developmental process. The tutorial contains
              four standalone informational modules covering randomization, blocking,
              factorial designs, and regression modeling. A fifth module contains two on-line
              case studies that the students may work through to more fully test their
              comprehension of the concepts. Chemical Engineering students are testing the
              product, and the results are being evaluated based on the guidelines published
              by the American Evaluation Association. The outcomes are being disseminated
              nationally.
