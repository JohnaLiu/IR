This award is for support for a project to examine the visual
              stratigraphy, physical and structural properties of the U.S. ITASE ice cores
              spanning the last 200 years of snow accumulation in Antarctica.  A first
              priority will be to examine visual stratigraphy to delineate annual layer
              structure for dating purposes and to determine to as great a depth as possible,
              accumulation variability over the full length of a stratigraphically dated
              core.  A second objective is to measure and analyze depth-density profiles. 
              The rate of snow and firn densification depends on both the rate at which the
              snow is deposited and the in situ snow temperature.  These data can and will be
              used to derive average snow accumulation rates for the sites where annual layer
              structure is difficult to decipher or where stratigraphic analysis fails
              altogether.  A third objective will entail measurements of mean crystal size
              over the full length of a core.  Crystal growth is a strongly temperature
              dependent process and measurements to be made on ITASE cores will help to
              bridge a significant data gap that exists in the mean annual temperature range,
              -31 to -50 degrees centigrade.  Additionally, crystal size data can also be
              used, in conjunction with ice loads based on density profile measurements, to
              extract  mean accumulation rates for these sites where stratigraphic dating of
              cores proves difficult or impossible to accomplish.  This is likely to occur at
              the lowest accumulation/lowest temperature sites along the ITASE traverse
              routes.
