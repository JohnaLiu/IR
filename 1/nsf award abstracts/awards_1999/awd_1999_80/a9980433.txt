Extensional fault systems are a brittle
              response to regional extensional stresses and are influenced by many parameters
              that affect rates of movements, interactions between fault segments and
              evolution of secondary structures.  This project is aimed at developing a
              detailed picture of the development of faults across an entire active
              normal-fault system, and will use the Canyonlands graben system in southeastern
              Utah as a natural laboratory.  The work will use interferometric synthetic
              aperture radar and Global Positioning system techniques to describe vertical
              and horizontal displacements in this active system.  Results should aid and
              advance understanding of the development of extensional fault systems.
