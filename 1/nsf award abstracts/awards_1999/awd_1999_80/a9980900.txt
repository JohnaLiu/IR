Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21) A course for undergraduates on "protecting
              information" is being developed that includes cryptography and error
              correction.  The course is multidiscplinary, integrating topics from
              mathematics, physics, and computer science.   The course also connects abstract
              concepts in these disciplines with familiar technology such as CD players and
              fax machines.  Recent research results in quantum cryptography and quantum
              computation is being introduced in the course. Pedagogical approaches available
              though information technology are used in the course.
