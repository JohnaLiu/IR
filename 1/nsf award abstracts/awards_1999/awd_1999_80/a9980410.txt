This project will study the paleomagnetic and rock magnetic
              variability of late Quaternary deep-sea sediments from Indonesia. The
              investigators will recover detailed paleomagnetic secular variation,
              paleointensity, and excursion records from selected intervals and assess the
              role of early sediment diagenesis as a possible complicating influence on such
              records. The final goal is to recover a complete record of geomagnetic field
              varaibility for the last 130,000 years and search for Brunhes-aged excursions
              that have been recorded in other parts of the world. Comparison of such records
              will provide new insight into the dynamo processes that generate such
              variability.
