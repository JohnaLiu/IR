Abstract    :
              This proposed study plans to analyze the extent to which, and the ways in which,
              schools and school districts have adapted to reform pressure and opportunities.
               The research team focuses on resource allocation patterns at different levels
              in the education system, different context conditions, and different levels of
              detail.  The study initially examines the national picture and then focuses on
              Texas and California.  The two research questions addressed in this proposal
              are:

1.  Have schools/school districts repositioned their resources in
              response to the reform demands of the 1990s? In what ways? To what
              extent?

2.  What are the resource allocation strategies of unusually
              effective schools?
