Timing of geologically recent faults is crucial to many
              neotectonic and environmental projects, but is difficult to determine if the
              fault movements occurred prior to recorded history.  Faults that break the
              surface commonly leave a scarp due to differential vertical movements. 
              Crudely, young fault scarps are steep and have sharp edges, whereas older ones
              have been eroded so that they are less steep and smoothed.  Attempts to use
              this relationship more quantitatively estimate a scarp "diffusivity" to
              calibrate the age vs. fault scarp geomorphology relationship.  However, this
              and other techniques have large errors which negatively impacts the ages of
              fault movement obtained.  This project will attempt to use cosmogenic
              chlorine-36 accumulation around several faults of known age to refine
              estimation of fault scarp diffusivity.  Results should help reduce errors in
              using fault scarp morphology and lower the costs of accurately estimating the
              age of fault movements.
