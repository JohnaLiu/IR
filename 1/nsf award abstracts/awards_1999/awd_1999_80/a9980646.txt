Time scales of magma residence and differentiation are
              difficult to quantify bur are important in understanding the evolution and
              dynamics of the magmatic reservoir system. No quantitative estimates for magma
              residence in Mauna Loa Volcano in Hawaii are currently available, and estimates
              for Kilauea Volcano range from tens to thousands of years.  Most of these
              estimates represent average residence times, and are subject to assumptions
              about the size of the reservoir and the magma supply rate.  We propose a
              different approach to determining timescales of magmatic processes by using
              Ra-Th disequilibria to measure the time since crystal growth rates,  which is a
              minimum residence time. Such analysis will yield cooling rates, and combined
              with crystal size data, will yield crystal growth rates, both of which have not
              been measured directly for sub-surface reservoirs in basaltic volcanoes.  
              Preliminary data from the 1955 east rift eruption of Kilauea suggest that
              residence is longer (and therefore that cooling and crystallization rates are
              lower) than most previous estimates.  Our data also suggest that Ra and Ba are
              differentially fractionated during crystal growth, requiring fractionation
              correction when using Ba as a chemical analog for Ra.  We propose to analyze
              additional samples to test the generality of these results and to determine
              whether the predicted Ra/Ba fractionations are consistent with data for young
              lavas.  These results will have important implications not only for studies of
              magma reservoir processes in Hawaiian volcanoes, but also more generally to
              timescales of basaltic differentiation.
