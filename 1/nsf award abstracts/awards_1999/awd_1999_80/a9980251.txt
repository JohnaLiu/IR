Abstract    :
              This is a three year Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) project at
              Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, John F. McDonald, P.I., entitled Remote
              Distance Learning for Design of Fast SiGe HBT Computer Circuits.  This project
              will employ an exciting new technology to empower students to learn how to
              design digital systems involving complex, high clock frequency computers and
              other circuits on a scale never before possible, and to enjoy the laboratory
              experience from remote locations, any time of the day.  In particular, to
              provide access to an exciting new supercomputer technology, employing a novel
              electronic materials system, Silicon Germanium (SiGe), in the form of
              Heterojuntion Bipolar Transistor (HBT) circuits.  The project involves creation
              of SiGe versions of circuits known as Field Programmable Circuit Boards
              (FPCB's), and Field Programmable Gate Array's (FPGA's).  The approach makes
              feasible the rapid prototyping of supercomputer circuits that would have been
              too expensive by other approaches.  This technology strengthens the student's
              ability to conceptualize these large, high speed systems in the abstract,
              virtual environment of inexpensive laptop and desktop computers, and university
              workstations and servers.
