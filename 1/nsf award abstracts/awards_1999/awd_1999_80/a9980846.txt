Astronomical Studies with the Caltech Submillimeter
              Observatory

This award supports research, technological development, and
              student education at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO).  The CSO
              consists of a 10.4-meter-diameter, high surface precision antenna located at an
              altitude of nearly 14,000 feet, just below the summit of Mauna Kea on the
              island of Hawaii.  The CSO's mission is to carry out spectroscopic and
              continuum observations of astronomical objects in the wavelength range
              1mm-350mm;  the opacity of the Earth's atmosphere to radiation at these
              wavelengths is the reason for the observatory's location at high altitude.  The
              observatory was constructed with funds from the NSF during the period
              1984-1987.  The CSO is presently the only US facility capable of operations
              throughout the full submillimeter atmospheric window.

Using  new cameras and
              other enhanced instrumentation, the CSO is proposing in the next three years to
              carry out three key projects:  (i) detection and study of the interstellar
              medium in distant and possibly primordial galaxies; (ii) pursuit of
              high-frequency Sunyaev-Zel'dovich  measurements in a large enough galaxy
              cluster sample to make a meaningful independent measurement of the Hubble
              constant; and (iii) study of the very earliest stages of star formation in the
              dense interstellar medium
