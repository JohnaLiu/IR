Abstract    :
              This project is the continuation of a large cosmic-ray detector at South Pole
              called the South Pole Air Shower Experiment (SPASE) that operates in
              coincidence with Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA).  The main
              goal is to study the composition of ultra-high-energy (3 PeV) primary cosmic
              rays.  These cosmic-rays interact in the atmosphere above South Pole and
              produce "showers" consisting of thousands of electrons and muons.  It is
              possible by measuring the resulting cosmic-ray showers at the surface with
              SPASE and two kilometers below the surface of the ice with AMANDA to deduce
              something about the original nucleus that caused the shower.  SPASE is also
              very valuable for providing diagnostic and calibration information for
              AMANDA.
