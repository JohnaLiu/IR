Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)
This project adapts materials developed at American
              University and Centre College to enhance science education at one university.
              It includes the introduction and use of a high-field NMR spectrophotometer into
              the chemistry curriculum as well as within the biology and physics curriculum.
              The topic of NMR has found such widespread application that many colleges and
              universities have been introducing the principles of NMR experimentation
              earlier and earlier in undergraduate education. Thus this project enriches the
              experience of many science students and impacts science education quite
              broadly. The introduction of this instrument into the undergraduate program
              helps achieve the university's goal of integrating scientific disciplines to
              prepare students for teaching and research opportunities in the twenty-first
              century.
