This investigation concerns the numerical modeling of the
              temporal variation of antarctic coastal polynyas and the rate of antarctic
              bottom water formation.  High resolution global models allow the inclusion of
              coastal polynyas - areas of open water that persist through the winter - and at
              the same time allow their impact to spread through the world ocean, giving a
              proper representation of the effect of polynyas on deep ocean ventilation.  The
              research will be focused on the interannual variability of antarctic coastal
              polynyas, the ice-ocean interactions that are associated with the formation of
              offshore polynyas, and the modulating effect of the antarctic circumpolar wave.
               The analysis will concentrate on the output of three high-resolution global
              models:  a twenty-year integration of a coupled ice-ocean model developed by
              the principal investigators at the Naval Postgraduate School; a three hundred
              year integration of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Parallel
              Climate Model, and multi-decadal sensitivity integrations of a coupled
              ice-ocean model developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. 


The
              physical insights about the mechanisms of offshore polynya formation are
              particularly important to understanding the possible influences of climatic
              change on open ocean deep convection and bottom-water production.  Studying the
              antarctic circumpolar wave will improve our knowledge of air-sea-ice
              interaction in the Southern Ocean on a regional scale, as well as atmospheric
              and oceanic teleconnections on a global scale.
