              9900510  Bates, Patricia
Modular program construction offers many benefits,
              including increased reliability, clarity, and maintainability of software
              components.  Unfortunately, modular programs are typically less efficient than
              their nonmodular counterparts.  Warm fusion is a technique for improving the
              efficiency of modularly constructed programs by eliminating from them data
              structures whose sole purpose is to "glue" together smaller program components
              into larger ones.  A fully automatic warm fusion engine has recently been
              developed, and this prototype successfully eliminates such data structures from
              a restricted, but pervasive, class of functional programs. This research
              focuses on extending the existing engine to accommodate more flexible and more
              widely applicable warm fusion heuristics. It also involves comprehensive
              testing of the extended prototype so that conditions under which the
              implemented warm fusion techniques succeed and fail in practice can be
              determined; this information will be used to quantify program improvement
              attributable to warm fusion, as well as to develop more general fusion
              techniques.  The ultimate goal of the research is to sufficiently enhance the
              existing engine so that the resulting system is suitable for incorporation into
              state-of-the-art functional language compilers.
