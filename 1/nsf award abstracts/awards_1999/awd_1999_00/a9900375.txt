Abstract    :
              This project investigates the superfluid phases of atomic nuclei in which each
              Cooper pair is composed of one neutron and one proton.  In one superfluid phase
              the neutron and proton are coupled to isospin T = 1 and  intrinsic spin S =0. 
              In another superfluid phase the neutron and proton are coupled to T = 0 and S =
              1.  These phases should be most likely to occur in nuclei which have
              approximately equal numbers of neutrons and protons.  There are also superfluid
              phases in which each Cooper pair is composed of two neutrons or two protons. 
              These pairs have T = 1 and S = 0.  All of these different superfluid phases can
              co-exist in the same nucleus and in the same wave-function.  Calculations on
              medium mass nuclei near the N = Z line will search for these exotic np
              superfluids.  Calculations will determine how the np superfluids depend on
              neutron excess N - Z, temperature, and spin.  The project will investigate
              transitions in the shapes of atomic nuclei at high temperatures.  Calculations
              on medium mass nuclei will search for isotopes where rotation of a hot
              spherical shape generates a hot prolate shape rotating around its symmetry
              axis.  These calculations will search for the second critical shape transition
              temperature at which the prolate shape rotating about its symmetry axis turns
              into an oblate shape rotating about its symmetry axis.
