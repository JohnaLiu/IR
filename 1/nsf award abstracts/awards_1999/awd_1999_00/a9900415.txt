The 1999 Aspen Winter Conference on Elementary Particle
              Physics will be held at the Aspen Center for Physics, Aspen, Colorado, January
              17-23, 1999.  This conference will bring together theoretical and experimental
              physicists in a highly interactive format to confront theories of the
              elementary particles with a wide range of observation facts.  Such a
              confrontation and the additional exchange of ideas which will take place at the
              conference, are very important to progress in the field.
