The Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority
              Participation (OK-LSAMP), comprising eight Partner institutions and 19
              Affiliates within the state of Oklahoma, was established to address the
              critical undersupply of minority students pursing degrees in Science
              Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology (SMET) fields.  Phase I, initiated by
              eight Partner institutions, features a multilayered student support system to
              improve the use of shared resources for outreach activities, educational
              achievement and preparation for advanced study in SMET fields.  In just over 4
              years, more than 640 Native American, African-American, Hispanic and Native
              Pacific Islander undergraduates students were served directly through Freshman
              Summer Bridge, Scholars, and Research Internship Programs.  The OK-LSAMP is now
              exceeding project graduation goals from the baseline of 214 in 1994, with 454
              degrees earned in 1997 and 410 in 1998.  Nationally, in 1997, the highest
              numbers of Native American students enrolled and receiving baccalaureate
              degrees were from Oklahoma Alliance universities.  Additionally, Native
              Americans were 5.6% of those enrolled in Oklahoma colleges and universities,
              were 9% of students enrolled in SMET, and receiving 8% of SMET baccalaureate
              degrees.  As the OK-LSAMP program reaches maturity, this progress should
              continue into the new millennium.  To maintain the educational continuum and to
              develop the SMET program further, we propose a Phase II program that emphasizes
              preparation for graduate education.

The overall objectives are:

to expand
              by including three new Partner institutions to broaden the pool of available
              targeted students;

to expand the Research experience through academic year
              activities; (The Summer Research Internship experience will be expanded to
              include more off-campus academic and non-academic research sites.)

to
              increase early preparation activities and subsequent application to graduate
              programs through a series of workshops and orientations to graduate schools and
              programs;

to establish Summer Transfer Bridge Program with 2-year
              Affiliates; and

to offer a clear and specific discipline related Teacher
              Preparation component to undergraduates seeking a degree in a SMET
              discipline.
