Abstract    :
              Since the publication of Darwin's Descent of Man, the biological study of human
              nature has been confronted with enormous critical risistance and, though the
              context has changed since the 19th century, these debates still rage.  The
              conference to be supported by this grant will bring together scholars from many
              disciplines who have taken part in these debates (though never together) to
              analyze the impact of recent research in biology and related fields on
              discussions of human nature.  More specifically, as philosophers of science
              will come together with biologists, anthropologists, and psychologist, the
              interplay of different disciplinary perspectives will (the conference
              organizers hope) precipitate new avenues of research and will dispel some
              all-too-common recent misconceptions about biological approaches to human
              nature.  Specific topics to be discussed include the implications of the
              results from primatology for the study of human behvaior and morality; the
              evolution of altruism; sex and sexuality; evolutionary psychology; and genes
              and behavior.  The participants range in academic rank form beginning assistant
              professor to full professor.
