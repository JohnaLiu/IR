The symposium "Metabolic Networking in Plants" to be held April
              22-25, 1999 at Iowa State University, will focus on the interconnections
              between metabolic pathways of plants. Subthemes are the use of functional
              genomics in metabolic analyses; impact of environment on interconnections
              between metabolic pathways; impact of development on interconnections between
              metabolic pathways; the regulation of metabolic pathways; and novel approaches
              to modeling and integration. The atmosphere will be informal and the format
              allows for extensive discussion both during and between sessions. An important
              purpose of these symposia is to promote interactions and new collaborations
              between individuals who might not normally come together at a single symposium.
              In doing this, we will include a spectra of attendees ranging from world famous
              scientists to highly promising students and post-doctoral fellows.

As we
              approach the time of the first total-plant-sequence, we need to use the wealth
              of information for understanding genome function in defining intricate
              metabolic networks. We need to undertake the task of functional assignments to
              batteries of genes on a large scale, identify interrelations among different
              metabolic pathways and decipher the interplay in their modulation by
              environmental and developmental cues. To achieve these shifts in our research
              paradigm, it is necessary to foster interdisciplinary research efforts for
              global analysis of metabolic pathways. We also need to train young scientists
              to approach plant metabolism with global analytical tools. We see the symposium
              as a way to educate students and post-doctoral associates and to promote
              meaningful collaborations and interdisciplinary interactions among established
              scientists.
