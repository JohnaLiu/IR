This award supports the participation of American
              scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on supramolecular photochemistry to be held
              in New Orleans, Louisiana for one week in December l999 or February 2000.  The
              co-organizers are Professor V. Ramamurthy of Tulane University and Professor K.
              Takagi of Nagoya University in Japan.  The meeting will focus on recent results
              in the area of photoreactions in organized assemblies, photochemistry and
              photophysics in nanostructures and photochemistry related to materials science
              and biological science.  Discussion will revolve around the following topics: 
              1) photochemical and photophysical phenomena in organic-inorganic hybrid
              systems (materials science related problems);  2) the role of organized media
              in photoproduct selectivity (chemistry in supramolecular assembly); and 3)
              supramolecular chemistry as related to biological phenomena.

Photochemistry
              is at a crossroad and the exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in
              this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will
              set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers have made
              a special effort to involve younger scientists.  The proceedings of the meeting
              are expected to be made available by the organizers on a web-site at Tulane
              University.  A brief scientific report of the meeting will also be published in
              the newsletter of Inter-American Photochemical Society.
