Abstract    :
              Accountability for performance is now recognized by NSF projects as a practice
              that they must establish as part of their efforts.  However, few Principal
              Investigators or their staff have the required background to develop and
              implement an accountability system for their projects.  This award will support
              the development of the tools for projects within the Advanced Technological
              Education Program to be able to carry out accountability assessments against a
              common framework of outcomes.                                                  
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                   In concert with ATE PIs, the Evaluation Center at Western
              Michgan University will prepare a set of indicators that represent quality
              technical education, prepare and pilot test instruments and guidebooks for data
              collection, and report data from the ATE projects that will provide information
              to the field on the impact and effectiveness of technological education.
