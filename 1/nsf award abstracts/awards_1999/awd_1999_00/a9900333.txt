Data-driven Control of Humanoid Robots

This is the
              first year funding of a three year continuing award. Robots and simulations
              with the complexity of a rigid body model of a human are difficult to control
              because of the need for coordinating many degrees of freedom.  Some
              applications also require that the resulting motion be natural looking or
              appealing, further complicating control.  We are exploring a data-driven
              approach to this problem. During the time frame of this proposal, we will
              collect significant quantities of data from human subjects using motion capture
              systems construct data-driven models of human movement for a variety of
              tasks,
and use the models to demonstrate robust, appealing motion of simulated
              figures and a physical humanoid robot.
