Abstract    :
              9900301, Azam
A methodology is presented that, if successful, will
              simultaneously quantify and qualify the majority of microbes present in an
              environmental sample. Such a methodology is a prerequisite to studying the
              distribution and diversity ofmarine microbes on the ocean basin scale. The
              research method is based on the fact that a seven base pair DNA tag, if
              sufficiently divergent, can differentiate between thousands microbial species.
              To be useful this tag region must be invariably located within a microbe's
              genome and it must be associated with a conserved DNA region that can be used
              to isolate the tag A tag region within the RNase P locus, a ubiquitous nbozyme,
              that fulfills the criteria ofbemg highly divergent and located next to a
              conserved region is identified. Fortuitously, the RNase P locus is also always
              found as one copy per genome. Therefore, this tag can be used as a
              quantitative, as well as qualitative, indicator of the microbial species
              present in a sample.
