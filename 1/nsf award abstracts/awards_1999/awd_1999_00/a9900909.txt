Basic Research in
              Information Privacy

New models of information privacy are needed if we ever
              expect to make proving security in real systems practical.  Traditional
              approaches treat privacy as a safety or information-flow property, the former
              being common among protocols and the latter among systems.  Yet neither
              approach is adequate.  Safety is too weak to reject some obvious privacy
              violations and information flow is too strong to admit some useful systems. 
              Among them are those whose security rests on parameters like the randomness and
              length of a secret.  Further, new design principles are needed to guide in
              building real systems that exhibit the new properties.  The research
              investigates practical models of information privacy and conditions under which
              they always hold in programs.  New techniques are investigated for proving
              privacy in practical systems and their implementations.
