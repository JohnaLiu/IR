              Partnerships: Evaluating Real-Time Database Protocols

Many real-time
              applications are becoming very sophisticated in their data
needs. 
              Applications such as agile manufacturing and air traffic control have data that
              span the spectrum from low level control data, typically acquired from sensors,
              to high level management and business data.  In such applications the seamless
              integration of data from all levels can provide a great degree of overall
              benefit.  Further, in all levels of the data and processing hierarchy of such
              applications, real-time requirements abound.  Current databases are not time
              cognizant and do not perform well in these applications.  Because of this there
              has been a significant increase in research in real-time databases in both
              academia and industry and many commercial products are beginning to emerge in
              this area.

This research involves prototyping and evaluating a novel
              real-time database system.  The work builds upon previous simulation studies
              that identified a number of novel solutions in real-time concurrency control,
              real-time transaction scheduling, and admission control and resource
              management.  The research builds on these novel solutions together with new
              ideas on an enhanced object model, exploitation of reflective information, and
              a uniform model for multimedia quality of service resource management.
