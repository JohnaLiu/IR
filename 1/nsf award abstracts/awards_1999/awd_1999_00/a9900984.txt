Title:  Modular
              Deductive-Algorithmic Verification of Hybrid Systems

The proposal describes
              techniques to integrate modular and deductive-algorithmic verification for
              reactive systems.  The goal is to verify, more automatically, larger systems
              than is possible by either technique alone.  The proposed techniques feature a
              tight integration of abstraction techniques and modular verification; they
              include: (1) Modular Deductive Model Checking: environmental assumptions needed
              to complete modular proofs are derived as part of the proof.  (2) Modular
              Abstraction and Invariant Generation:  invariants of modules are generated
              based on abstractions with different classes of assumptions on their
              environment. (3) Modular Techniques for Hybrid Systems: assumptions are
              generated for a continuously evolving environment.  The proposed research will
              allow the partial verification of open systems, before their components are
              fully specified or their environment is known. Since these methods require less
              interaction, it is feasible to perform more checks on early versions of a
              system being designed.  The techniques will be applicable to general
              infinite-state reactive systems.  In particular, they will be applied to the
              challenging problems posed by hybrid systems. The techniques will be
              implemented in the framework of the STeP (Stanford Temporal Prover)
              
verification system, and used to verify a complex hybrid system as a case
              study.
