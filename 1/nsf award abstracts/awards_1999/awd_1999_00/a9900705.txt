Abstract    :
                  This SBIR Phase II award is to develop a commercially viable enhanced
              process for the exhaustive oxidation of air contaminants. The process involves
              ozonation. of a fluorocarbon fluid possessing extremely high solubility for
              ozone. The fluorocarbon is completely oxidation resistance and biologically
              inert and its high solubility for gases has allowed its use as a artificial
              blood substitute in thousands of surgical operations. The fluorocarbon has
              demonstrated the preferential ability to extract a variety of both gaseous and
              liquid hydrocarbon and chlorocarbon contaminants from air streams. It has a low
              viscosity and an even lower volatility while being a superior solvent for
              gaseous contaminants relative to all hydrocarbon solvents. The fluid is an
              excellent medium for oxidation reactions and poses no contamination risk
              itself. For such reasons it has been previously used with dispersions of TiO2
              particles for the ultraviolet (UV) catalyzed photooxidation of air
              contaminants. Exhaustive oxidation was achieved in our phase I effort due to
              the air contaminants collecting at the solid/liquid interface of the TiO2
              particles and their intermediate oxidation products being unable to escape. The
              intermediate oxidation products themselves physically adsorbed at the
              solid/liquid interface until completely oxidized to C02. The proposed prototype
              has significant potential to increased oxidation of air contaminants by an
              order of magnitude.
     The target markets for the proposed process are
              hospitals, nursing homes, hotels, office buildings, shopping malls and
              restaurants mention a few. Essentially the market is the treatment of indoor
              air of any structure occupied by humans.
