A deep wide field infrared survey:  old galaxies at high
              redshifts

Sven Persson

Dr. Persson in conducting a near infrared and
              optical survey to study galaxies at redshifts from 1 to 2.  His team has access
              to a four-channel mosaic infrared imager (at Carnegie and at Cambridge) that
              allows them to survey one square degree to depths sufficient to detect galaxies
              more than a magnitude fainter than L* at z = 1 and L* galaxies to z = 2.  They
              plan to locate the oldest galaxies present, derive their space density and
              luminosity functions for comparison with lower redshifts as a test for
              luminosity and density evolution.  They expect to detect 3000 galaxies and
              estimate their redshifts to +/-0.2. The fields have been chosen to reachable
              with the Very Large Array (VLA).
