The objective of this research project is to quantify the
              changes in nanoscale mechanical properties of metal surfaces under specific
              electrochemical environments where the surface energy, surface stress, chemical
              composition and excess surface charge can be precisely controlled. 
              Specifically, in-situ nanoindentation measurements (hardness, elastic modulus,
              adhesion and indentation creep) will be performed on metallic surfaces as a
              function of (1) systematically varying the surface stress through
              electrochemical control of the surface charge, (2) varying the surface energy
              and stress through the electrochemical deposition of strained metal monolayers
              as well as the growth of surface oxides, and (3) varying the adhesion between
              the surface and the surface probe through the use of different probe-sample
              combinations.  These results will lead to a better understanding of the basic
              mechanisms by which surface chemistry can alter the nanomechanical properties
              of surfaces.  These results are expected to have implications in lubricant
              development and a basic understanding of friction processes.
