Abstract    :
              The development of panethnicity--solidarity among culturally and linguistically
              diverse national origin groups--is perhaps the most notable ethnic phenomenon
              to occur in the U.S. over the past 30 years. Currently, however, there are no
              theories that directly and systematically address when and why panethnicity
              occurs. This doctoral dissertation project extends competition theory and
              cultural division of labor theory to make new predictions about when panethnic
              behavior will increase among Asian Americans from 1965 to 1995. Data for two
              dependent variables will be collected: (1) the formation of ethnic (based on
              national origin ties such as Chinese or Korean) and panethnic (based on ties to
              the broader group, Asian American) organizations from Encyclopedia of
              Associations; (2) the occurrence of ethnic and panethnic collective action
              events from five large, national newspapers. The proposed data sets will enable
              empirical testing of theoretical predictions about the structural conditions
              under which solidarity (organizations) and mobilization (collective action)
              will emerge, resulting in movement toward the construction of a general theory
              of panethnicity. In addition, more accurate measures of real and perceived
              competition and new methods for measuring ethnic stratification will be
              utilized in the event history and pooled time series analyses.
