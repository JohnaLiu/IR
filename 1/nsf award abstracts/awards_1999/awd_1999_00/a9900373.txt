The New York City Board of Education Community School District
              #18 requests $862,790 to design a Parent Involvement in Science, Mathematics,
              and Technology Program.  The program is designed to stimulate parents to become
              informed, active proponents for high quality and more universally available
              science, mathematics, and technology education for their children.  The SMART
              Parents project team would design and disseminate strategies to enable parents
              to support their children's science, mathematics, and technology
              education.

Innovative materials and strategies will be developed that will
              actively engage over 6,000 parents/families over the thirty-eight (38) months
              duration of the project.  Almost 20,000 families will become involved in the
              leadership-training component of this project.  The initiative will assist
              parents in supporting their children's education in science, mathematics, and
              technology education.  Ultimately, the project will enhance parents' knowledge
              and understanding of Informal Science Education.
