Description: This award is to support a planning visit by a
              US scientist to Egypt.  Dr. Farouk El-Baz, Director of the Remote Sensing
              Center at Boston University plans todiscuss with Dr. Hassan El-Etr of the
              Egyptian National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Science (NARSS) a
              project on the geological history of landform development in the hyper-arid
              desert of western Egypt.   He also plans to conduct preliminary field studies
              at the southern part of the Western Desert of Egypt southwest of Aswan.  The
              visit is intended to work out with Egyptian scientists the details of a joint
              research project to be submitted to the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program.  This
              proposal meets the INT objective of supporting joint U.S.-foreign activities
              that are likely to enhance collaboration in areas of mutual interest.
