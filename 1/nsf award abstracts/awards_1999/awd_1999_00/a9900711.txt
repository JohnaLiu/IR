Effects of wildfires on soil methane fluxes in Florida
              pine plantations

Southern pine plantations account for more than half of the
              total commercial timberland in the United States (76 million hectares). Despite
              their importance, we do not know how natural disturbances affect greenhouse gas
              emissions from soils in these pine plantations. The recent outbreak of natural
              wildfires in Florida provides a unique opportunity to examine their impact on
              soil methane emissions. The investigators will test the hypothesis that
              wildfires change the direction of the soil methane flux; from sinks in unburned
              plantations to sources in burned plantations. To test this hypothesis the
              researchers will: (1) make intensive field measurements of soil methane fluxes
              in burned and unburned plantations, (2) identify factors controlling the
              wildfire-induced changes in the direction of the soil methane flux and (3)
              examine the interaction between climate and methane fluxes. Results will be
              used to make a preliminary assessment of the importance of wildfires on soil
              methane fluxes.
