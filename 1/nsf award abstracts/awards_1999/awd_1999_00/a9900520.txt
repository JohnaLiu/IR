Abstract    :
              This is a summer research conference to be held June 26 through July 1, 1999 in
              Saxtons River, Vermont under the auspices of the Federation of American
              Societies for Experimental Biology.  The conference will focus on the structure
              and function of membrane receptors that play critical roles in the modulation
              of immune responses.  These receptors include such important members as the
              antigen receptors of T and B lymphocytes and cytokine receptors.  A special
              emphasis will be given to the rapidly moving field of inhibitory receptors
              involved in negative signaling pathways.  There will be two keynote lectures to
              be given by Dr. Don Wiley, a leader in the structural biology of
              immunoreceptors, and Dr. William Paul, a leader in cytokine biology.  In
              addition there will be eight scientific sessions on specific topics with
              invited speakers, and one session devoted to the discussion of selected posters
              submitted to the conference.  The themes of the scientific sessions are (1) the
              T cell receptor, (2) the B cell receptor, (3) Fc receptors, (4) inhibitory
              receptors, (5) accessory and adapter molecules, (6 & 7) kinases, phosphatases
              and other signaling elements, and (8) cytokines and their receptors.
