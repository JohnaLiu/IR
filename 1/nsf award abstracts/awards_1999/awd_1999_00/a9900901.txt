Abstract    :
              Partial travel support is provided for the participants at the Second Annual
              Meeting of the Institute of Multifluid Science and Technology (IMuST) in Santa
              Barbara, February 26-28, 1999.  IMuST promotes critical evaluation of current
              resarch, interdisciplinary activities, and synergism between fundamental
              research and industrial needs.  This annual meeting will have a focus on
              dispersed systems.  The meeting has three parts, including emerging areas of
              research, technical challenges and education, and an open forum.  The NSF, U.S.
              Department of Energy, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and National
              Aeronautics and Space Administration will co-sponsor this meeting. 
              Approximately 50 participants will receive partial support.  The Proceedings
              and other materials prepared by the IMuST technical advisory committees will be
              made available to the scientific community and industry.
