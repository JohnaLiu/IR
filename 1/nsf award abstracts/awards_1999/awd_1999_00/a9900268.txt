Digital
              Government: NSF-CNPq Collaborative Research - Issues in the Development of
              Spatial Spreadsheets and Browsers

This proposal will develop algorithms and
              systems to support indexing, joining and querying of spatial data, with output
              as tabular data (spreadsheets) rather than rendered maps.  Technologies to be
              explored include storage and retrieval of vector and raster data, presentation
              at multiple resolution layers, and querying optimization.  Collaborators in
              Brazil for this project are Professors Jano Moreira de Souza and Claudio
              Esperanca.

Federal partnership will be coordinated through the Federal
              Geographic Data Committee; the U.S. Geological Survey will be the focus
              agency.
