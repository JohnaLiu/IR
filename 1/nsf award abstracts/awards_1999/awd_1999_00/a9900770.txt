Research on theoretical cosmology

P. J. E. Peebles

Dr. Peebles is
              analyzing the empirical evidence on how the growth of structure in the Universe
              occurred and comparing it to the predictions of general relativity theory
              applied to the evolution of an expanding universe.  The cosmological inflation
              concept offers a picture for the behavior of the very early universe and how it
              might have set the initial conditions for structure formation.  Dr. Peebles is
              analyzing the possibilities offered by inflation and its confrontation with the
              observational evidence There are several pieces to this project.  Dr. Peebles
              is completing the study of the application of the numerical action method to
              simulated catalogs and the new Tully redshift distance catalog.   In addition,
              he is studying the nonlinear aspherical evolution of the Local Group of
              galaxies using this numerical action method.
