Abstract    :
              The objective of this research project is to provide experimental validation of
              a hybrid semi-active / passive base isolation system combining low-damping
              rubber isolators and semi-active control elements which exhibit variable
              stiffness and damping properties.  This research involves control theory
              development, device development, small-scale verification tests, and large
              scale tests.  The large-scale vibration control experiments will be carried out
              in collaboration with the Japanese National research Institute for Earth
              Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED).  These experiments will be designed to
              validate the control system, which is simple to implement, robust to
              uncertainties in the structural model, requires very little external power, and
              has guaranteed closed loop stability.

Members with adjustable stiffness and
              damping can be used to modify the dynamics of a base isolated structure. 
              Optimal control methods, and control rules based on Lyapunov's direct method,
              will be investigated.  The objective of the control will be to reduce
              deformation of the base isolation system without increasing absolute
              accelerations of the isolated mass.  The results of this research will provide
              designers with the knowledge required to combine variable property materials
              (such as ER materials) with passive base isolation and simple feedback control
              to limit isolator deflections.
