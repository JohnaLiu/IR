This project will explore some of the fundamental scientific
              issues associated with a new method for lubrication of magnetic data storage
              media.  Currently hard disk media are lubricated with ultra-thin films of
              perfluoropolyalkylethers (PFPEs) which are applied to the surface by dipping
              the disk into a solution of the PFPE.  As high areal data storage densities are
              required there is an increasing need for improved and more highly controlled
              methods of disk surface lubrication.  Vapor phase lubrication will apply the
              lubricant under vacuum in the same environment that is used to deposit the thin
              film coating used on the disk surface.  This represents a clear improvement
              over current technology but opens up a host of new problems and issues.

The
              surface chemistry of fluoroethers, fluorinated alcohols, and PFPEs will be
              studied on the surfaces of freshly sputtered, amorphous hydrogenated carbon
              films (a-CHx) that have never been exposed to air.  This emulates the
              conditions being used in a process being developed at Intevac, Inc., which is
              collaborating on the project under the GOALI program. The work will determine
              the nature of bonding of the functional units of PFPEs (ether linkages and
              hydroxyl endgroups) on fresh a-CHx films.  In addition methods will be used to
              deposit high molecular weight PFPEs under vacuum conditions.  The surface
              chemistry, desorption rates, and decomposition mechanisms of these PFPEs will
              be compared to those of PFPE films deposited onto partially oxidized a-CHx
              films such as those currently used to protect hard disk surfaces.
