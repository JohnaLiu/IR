Dr. Dalcanton
              will study the formation of spiral galaxies, through two distinct approaches. 
              The first will concentrate on studying the formation and evolution of galaxy
              disks and the second the formation of galaxy bulges.  The aim is to provide
              direct measurements of physical quantities which either control galaxy
              formation, such as mass or angular momentum, or describe galaxy evolution, such
              as timing and metallicity.  A variety of observational data, including optical
              and near IR images, optical spectroscopy and HI maps, will be used to provide
              the basic data from which mass distributions, star formation histories and
              metallicities will be determined.
