Abstract    :
              The main thesis in our proposed research is to investigate the dynamics of
              hadronic and nuclear systems with a particular emphasis on its relation to the
              underlying dynamics of quarks and gluons and also with a view to using nuclear
              phenomena for studying symmetries of elementary processes.  Specifically, we
              study the consequences of nuclear chiral perturbation theory as applied to
              few-nucleon systems, in-nuclear-medium meson properties, the quark structure of
              hadrons, phenomenology of axial U(1) symmetry, proton-antiproton annihilation
              at low energies and neutrino-nucleus reactions and their application to
              astrophysics.
