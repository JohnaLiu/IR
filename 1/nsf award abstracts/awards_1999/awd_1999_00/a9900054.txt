Abstract    :
              This is an award to support exploratory research on the potential for genetic
              modification of Indian mustard to increase the rate at which it can extract
              selenium from soil contaminated with selenium.  This plant species is
              moderately tolerant of selenium in soil and grows rapidly.  If it can be
              genetically modified to become a hyperaccumulater of selenium it could
              potentially be used to remove selenium from contaminated soil.  In this
              project, the investigator will be exploring the potential applicability of
              using the enhanced, modified capability of this plant species under greenhouse
              and field conditions to determine its potential applicability for use in
              decontamination of agricultural soil. 

The proposal leading to this award
              was submitted to NSF under the Special Guidelines for an SGER (Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research) in the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (NSF 99-2).  Results of
              this research are expected to provide the basis for determining whether genetic
              modification of a plant species to increase its ability to extract selenium
              from selenium-contaminated soil, should be further considered for potential use
              in engineering design of procedures to remove pollutants from soil.  Results
              may also determine the nature of further research that would be needed to
              explore this and related concepts for prevention of groundwater pollution from
              chemically contaminated soil.
