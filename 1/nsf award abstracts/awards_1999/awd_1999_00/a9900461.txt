The mechanism and timing of partial melting and melt extraction
              in the mantle beneath arcs constitutes one of the key unresolved questions
              regarding arc magmatism.  This collaboration between researchers at the
              Universities of Minnesota and Iowa will use analyses of U-series nuclides and
              particularly of 231Pa in young volcanic rocks to better understand the melting
              process beneath the Central American arc and to determine how this process is
              affected by fluxes of components from the subducting slab.  Preliminary studies
              show that 231Pa is strongly fractionated from U in the sub-arc mantle prior to
              eruption on a time scale similar to or less than the half life of 231Pa (33
              kyr), strongly suggesting that 231Pa is a sensitive indicator of the timing and
              mechanism of melting and melt extraction.  Measurements of (231Pa)/(235U) and
              (230Th)/(238U) activity ratios using thermal ionization mass spectrometry and
              (226Ra)/(230Th) ratios using alpha counting techniques will be made for an
              along-arc suite of young volcanic rocks from the southern Central American arc
              in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The southern Central American arc is an ideal
              location for studying melting and mass transfer processes using U-series
              isotopes because many of the parameters affecting arc volcanism, such as the
              composition of the mantle and the mass flux of components from the subducting
              slab, vary across the region in a systematic and well-characterized fashion.
              The resulting data set will be to our knowledge the most complete study of
              U-series isotopes associated with an arc province, and combined with the trace
              element and long-lived isotopic data will yield a unique body of data against
              which hypotheses for melting and mass transfer in arcs can be tested.
