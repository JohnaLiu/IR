Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical physics will be carried out on the effects of the
              surrounding environment on elementary and nuclear particle reaction rates in
              astrophysical contexts.  The applications are to neutrino physics in supernovae
              and neutron stars, to the early universe, and to nuclear reaction rates in
              stars.  The areas of physics that come into play are particle physics, the
              quantum theory of many particle systems, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. 
              The studies to be undertaken are important to our making progress on the
              solution of several astrophysical mysteries.
