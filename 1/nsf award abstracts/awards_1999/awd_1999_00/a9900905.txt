Abstract    :
              Recent studies of magnetospheric substorms have shown that the initiation of a
              substorm is often accompanied by significant levels of wave activity.  It has
              been suggested that this wave activity may play an important role in the
              process of substorm onset.  This project will examine the nonlinear evolution
              of field-line resonances (FLRs) associated with substorms by using the
              magnetohydrodynamic equations with a generalized Ohm's law.  The FLR model will
              be improved by including the reflection of Alfven waves off the ionosphere, the
              nonlinear feedback due to the inhomogeneity of the ionospheric conductance and
              the dynamic evolution of the plasma sheet.  Both theoretical and numerical
              simulation studies will be pursued and the results will be compared with data
              from the Canadian CANOPUS instruments.
