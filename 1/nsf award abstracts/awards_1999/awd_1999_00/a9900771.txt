Abstract    :
              Recent experimental progress in the measurement of the 1S-2S transition
              frequency of Hydrogen, the Lamb shift, the deuterium isotope shift and the
              muonium hyperfine splitting show that it is important to include higher order
              terms in the effective Hamiltonian to get agreement between quantum
              electrodynamical theory and experiment.  The research will address these issues
              by performing state-of-the-art, QED calculations to the 10kHz in atomic
              Hydrogen.
