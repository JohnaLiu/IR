This research focus on developing techniques to
              analyze software documents for defect detection. More especifically, mutation
              testing and document reading techniques will be tailored to detect defects in
              software formal specifications and source code at Brazilian and American
              academia and industries. This family of software analysis technologies will be
              empirically validated in controlled experiments, and packaged in tailorable and
              reusable software engineering laboratory packages. The goals of this work are:
              (1) to create software analysis technologies that can be successfully used for
              defect detection in software specifications and code, and develop empirical
              methods that can be followed to continually improve those techniques in
              different environments and cultural settings; (2) to develop evaluation methods
              that can be used to compare diverse software defect detection technologies in
              academic and industrial settings; (3) to expand the software analysis
              technology base, creating new laboratory packages that can be adapted and
              reused by other software engineering researchers, based upon their own
              environmental and cultural needs
