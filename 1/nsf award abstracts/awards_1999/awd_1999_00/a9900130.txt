Abstract    :
                   An innovative, agile approach for reliably fabricating tailored oxide
              composites for high temperature diesel engine applications is being developed
              under Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) program
              involving researchers at the University of Illinois and Caterpillar, Inc.  This
              interdisciplinary university-industry program is aimed at establishing the
              underlying processing knowledge base needed to create the next generation of
              components for diesel engines with high thermal efficiency and reduced fuel
              consumption.  The program involves the simultaneous development a new materials
              system, manufacturing process, and target application.  The materials system
              consists of an oxide-based composite powder processed in an aqueous organic
              solution that undergoes gelation to form a rigid component upon casting.  This
              system will serve as the feedstock in a robotically controlled extrusion
              apparatus, a solid freeform fabrication device, that allows for local
              compositional tailoring on length scales of the order of 100 um.
     The
              combination of these two emerging technologies, "gel" casting and solid
              freeform fabrication, will be studied here for the first time, and should yield
              dramatic improvements in the processing, design, and performance of advanced
              ceramics.
