Abstract    :
              Dr. Gott is developing analytic tools to analyze the topology of three
              dimensional large scale structure in the Universe.  Dr. Gott is conducting 1
              billion particle n-body simulations to produce various topologies and is adding
              hydrodynamics to the code.  Observational data are smoothed to produce a
              density field.  Then density field contour surfaces are constructed.  If the
              smoothing length is larger than the correlation length, the resultant density
              fluctuations are still in the linear regime.  Fluctuations in the linear regime
              grow in place by gravitational instability so that density contour surfaces
              containing a given volume fraction seen in the smoothed map made today should
              resemble those in the initial conditions.
