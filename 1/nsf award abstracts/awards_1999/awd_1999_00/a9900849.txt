Abstract    :
              The United States, Canada and Great Britain all liberalized their abortion laws
              in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but, in the process, these countries
              established markedly different abortion policies. Though these policies have
              changed over time, the differences have persisted. Abortion policies have also
              varied markedly among American states. This doctoral dissertation research
              project will examine the determinants of the character and timing of abortion
              policies. This includes an analysis of variation across the three nations and
              across American states. The analyses are based on theoretical models and
              conceptual schemes prominent in the cross-national literature on social policy.
              A synthetic model is offered which suggests that political actors are strongly
              bounded by the constitutional structures of their polity. Several comparative
              and quantitative strategies will be employed to appraise the theoretical
              models. First, the project will include comparative historical analyses of
              major national-level policy episodes in the United States, Canada and Great
              Britain. Second, it will contain comparative historical analyses of state-level
              abortion policy-making in four American states. Third, it will contain
              quantitative and event history analyses of abortion policies in the fifty
              American states. Finally, it will utilize Qualitative Comparative Analysis
              (QCA) to appraise combinational arguments.
