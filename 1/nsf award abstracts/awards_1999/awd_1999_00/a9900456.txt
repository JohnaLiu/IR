                                                   The Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Aseptic Processing and Packaging Studies is being funded
              for its second five-year cycle as a multi-university Center with the addition
              of a research site at the Ohio State University to the original North Carolina
              State University and the University of California at Davis research groups.
              

The research projects to be funded at the Center's new research site are
              "Microbial Control of Fluid Foods", "Safe Cheddar Cheese from Raw Milk",
              "Validating Sterilization Efficiency of Aseptic Packaging Systems", "Modeling
              of Pulsed Electric Field Processes" and "Process Development of Single Step
              Microbial and Colloidal Stabilization for Fermented Beverages."
