Abstract    :
              By and large, examinations of legal education assume that both law schools and
              the legal profession are monolithic--that the key dimension of the
              socialization process is introducing students to the collective identity of
              lawyers, thus transforming them from non-lawyers into lawyers. This doctoral
              dissertation project challenges the two implicit and related assumptions of
              existing work on lawyers and legal education: 1 ) that any heterogeneity in
              professional ideology among lawyers is produced exclusively in the legal
              workplace and 2) that to the extent legal education indoctrinates students in
              professional ideology, it does so only in the collective ideology of the
              profession. The research tests the hypothesis that the ideological groundwork
              for differing views of the legal profession is laid in law schools and that the
              ideas presented to students about lawyering differ based on the school's
              position in the educational prestige hierarchy. The research compares the
              creation and diffusion of models of law and lawyering in law schools of
              different levels of prestige. A collective case study method is used to compare
              schools that prepare students to assume elite positions in the profession with
              schools that produce the profession's lower-status practitioners.
