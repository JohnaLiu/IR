The magnetization reversal, or coercivity, of nanoparticles
              and nanocomposites is investigated on a nanometer scale using the Foucault
              method of Lorentz microscopy.  Nanoparticles with extremely large or very small
              values of magnetocrystalline anisotropy are studied to extend existing models
              of coercivity.  In high anisotropy ball milled SmCo5 nanoparticles the emphasis
              is on understanding the roles of strain, grain boundaries, and particle sizes
              in order to maximize the switching field.  In low anisotropy Fe50Co50
              nanoparticles minimal coercivity is desired, but it is unclear whether the best
              precursors to soft magnetic nanocomposites are superparamagnetic, or merely
              have low coercivity.  The processing methods are varied to optimize the
              coercivities of the nanoparticles, whereupon they are compacted into
              nanocomposites.  Cold isostatic pressing, magnetic compaction, and plasma
              pressure compaction are examined to determine the best method to yield the
              highest density without significant grain growth.  Two types of nanocomposites
              with potential applications are examined, exchange spring magnets made by
              compaction of SmCo5 and Fe50Co50 nanoparticles and soft magnetic nanocomposites
              made by compaction of Fe50Co50 nanoparticles that have very thin carbon-rich
              coatings.  Lorentz microscopy techniques are used to observe magnetization
              reversals on a submicron length scale.  The microscopy results, in combination
              with standard methods to analyze the microstructure and chemical composition,
              identify the weak links that reduce the coercivity of a permanent magnet, or
              increase it in a soft magnetic material.  The feedback guides the processing
              modifications required to optimize the magnetic properties of the
              nanocomposites.

This program examines exchange spring magnets, which
              could have higher energy products at lower cost than current high performance
              permanent magnets, and soft magnetic nanocomposites, which could have lower
              power losses, higher permeabilities, and greater stability than existing
              materials in niche applications at high temperatures or high
              frequencies.
