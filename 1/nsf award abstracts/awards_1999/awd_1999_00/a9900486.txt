Abstract    :
              
 

The proposal is to investigate the next generation of interband
              mid-wave-infrared (MWIR) lasers.  The specific goal of this research is the
              realization of high performance, spectrally pure, antimonide MWIR diode lasers
              that can be incorporated into spectroscopic instruments for remote sensing and
              medical diagnostics in the 2-5 micron wavelength region.  The efforts will
              include (1) the engineering of superlattice and quantum well lasers and (2) the
              development of processes and techniques for fabricating single-mode antimonide
              lasers.
