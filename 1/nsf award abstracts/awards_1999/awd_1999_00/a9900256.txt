This award to University of Texas at Austin will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Longhorn, a research
              vessel operated by the university's Marine Science Institute as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              instrumentation to be acquired includes a pure water system, a block meter
              wheel and two computers for shipboard use. The shared-use instrumentation
              supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in 
              the Gulf of Mexico, during 1999 and future years.
