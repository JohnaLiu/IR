Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be concerned with the
              electromagnetic and gravitational properties and interactions of neutrinos,
              when they propagate through a dense medium such as the Sun, a supernova, or
              through the environment of dense objects such as active galactic nuclei. 
              Detailed calculations of the transition rates for various processes involving
              neutrinos propagating under such conditions will be performed.  These results
              are needed in order to understand the physics of neutrinos in such
              environments, which is important for testing the consequences of the recent
              experimental observations that indicate that neutrinos have a small, non-zero
              value of the mass.
