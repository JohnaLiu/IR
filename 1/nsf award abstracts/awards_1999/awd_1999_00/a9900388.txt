This grant is for the annual Summer Institute in Statistical
              Genetics at North Carolina State University. The Institute consists of a series
              of three-day workshops offering intense training in the methods for performing
              statistical analyses of genetic data. It is aimed primarily at geneticists
              wishing to learn statistical methodology, but also attracts some statisticians
              wishing to learn about genetic applications. The courses are taught by faculty
              drawn from NC State University and other institutions, and attracts about 200
              participants worldwide. These funds will be used for student
              scholarships.

With the rapid progress in genomic science, due in large part
              to the Human Genome Project, there is accumulating a vast amount of genetic
              data. These data will allow for a new understanding of the processes of
              evolution, of the means for identifying genes that affect human diseases and
              traits of economic importance in domesticated species, and of the means for
              identifying individuals in forensic, endangered species and varietal protection
              contexts. These data all require appropriate statistical analyses in order to
              extract the most information, but training in statistical genetics does not
              form part of most university curricula. The Summer Institute brings together
              world authorities who can both cover the basic elements of their specialties
              and can describe new methods.
