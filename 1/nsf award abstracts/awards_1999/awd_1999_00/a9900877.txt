Abstract    :
              Interaction of gamma ray bursts with their surrounding interstellar
              medium

Abraham Loeb

The field of gamma ray burst research is highly
              active.  The recent discoveries of optical and radio afterglows from gamma ray
              bursts has stimulated research efforts into the theory that might explain such
              afterglows.  The gamma ray burst last a matter of a few seconds.  The
              afterglows emit non-thermal continuum radiation from the radio to x-ray and
              fade away over timescales of months.  

Dr. Loeb is studying the ionization
              and hydrodynamic impact of gamma ray bursts on their surrounding interstellar
              medium.  He is calculating the emission and absorption spectrum of gamma ray
              burst remnants as a function of their age up to about a million years after the
              explosion.  He is developing both one and two dimensional hydrodynamic codes
              that will extend the current fireball model beyond its self similar spherically
              symmetric regime.  He is also exploring the possibility that some of the gian
              HI supershells in nearby galaxies are gamma ray burst remnants.  Also under
              investigation is the expected evolution of the afterglow luminosity function
              with redshift.
