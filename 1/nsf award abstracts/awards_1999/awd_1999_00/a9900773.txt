Abstract    :
              Theoretical physics research in string theory will include the study of black
              hole thermodynamics using methods of both string theory and polymer physics,
              and the elucidation of geometric structures of "M-theory," which underlies
              string theory.  The statistical basis of black hole thermodynamics is at the
              heart of understanding quantum gravity, and hence is important to understanding
              the underlying theory of all fundamental interactions.  Surprising connections
              with "soft matter" and biophysical systems are to be further explored with
              potentially valuable applications. Recent advances reveal that M-theory, the
              theory unifying the five distinct superstring theories, has an even richer
              geometrical structure than had been previously realized and which points to new
              phases of M-theory as well as possible implications for inflationary cosmology
              of the universe.  The planned work promises to shed light on the underlying
              structure of the unified theory and on the explanation of the origin and
              evolution of the early universe.
