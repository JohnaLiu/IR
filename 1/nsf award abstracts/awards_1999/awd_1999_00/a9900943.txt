The
              recommended project will examine the comparative performance of seismometers
              associated with the Ocean Seismic Network Pilot Experiment, a group of three
              seismometers installed at the OSN-1 site in and around ODP Hole 843B, located
              225 km SW of Oahu, Hawaii. These seismometers were installed in the borehole,
              buried in mud (ooze), and on top of the seafloor sediments. The project will
              compute the detectability of earthquakes (signal-to-noise ratio) for all three
              seismometers, and compare them to results from other land-based seismic systems
              and earlier ocean-based seismic systems.  In addition, there will be a focus on
              computing and analyzing the ambient noise spectra of the mud-buried and
              seafloor seismometers, especially in regards to sediment shear-wave resonances,
              compliance, and the effects of bottom currents and gravity waves.  Evaluation
              of this data will lead to recommendations for revised designs and future OSN
              installations.
