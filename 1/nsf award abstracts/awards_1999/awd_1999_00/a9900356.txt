Abstract    :
              The proposed research concerns the development of molecular imprinting
              techniques to create binding and cataylic sites for organic molecues in
              crosslinked polymer networks.  The term molecular imprinting refers to chemical
              techniques being devevloped that enable the synthesis of highly structured
              membranes and thin films.  These materials can subsequently be used to
              selectively transport organic molecules and other substrates through them. 
              Molecular imprinting is a rapidly expanding field that holds significant
              potential for providing novel materials with applications in chemical
              separations(like chromatography) catalysis and chemical sensing.
