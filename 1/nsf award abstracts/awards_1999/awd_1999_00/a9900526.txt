During assembly of progeny particles, many viruses (typified
              by phage P22) assemble protein shells first and then insert DNA into these
              shells. The P22 shells contain three critical polypeptides, coat protein,
              scaffolding protein and portal protein.  In addition, two non-structural
              P22-encoded proteins, p2 and p3, are critical in the DNA recognition/entry
              process. The coat protein forms the exterior shell of the precursor particle,
              the scaffolding protein is required to build the procapsid but leaves the
              structure before DNA enters, and the portal protein forms a ring-shaped
              structure at one vertex of the protein shell.  After co-assembly with coat
              protein to form procapsids, scaffolding protein is released from the procapsid
              during the DNA packaging portion of the virion assembly pathway, and so it
              functions catalytically in virion assembly. The role of the P22 scaffolding
              protein is the central focus of this research.  P22 guides the coat protein's
              assembly by co-assembling with it, and it recruits the portal protein into the
              structure. These processes will be studied genetically and biophysically. 
              Knowledge gained will contribute to our understanding of the dsDNA viruses, and
              will also increase our knowledge of proteins that catalyze the assembly of
              other macromolecules. 

Understanding the molecular basis of how viruses are
              built is important both at the level of expanding our knowledge of how Earth's
              biosphere works and in specific terms for agriculturally important viruses.
              Bacteriophage P22 is an experimentally tractable virus with features that are
              typical of many viruses with large dsDNA chromosomes.  P22 virus infection will
              be studied with the goal of understanding at a molecular level how large virus
              shells are assembled.  Knowledge gained will contribute to our overall
              understanding of the viruses, and will also specifically increase our knowledge
              of proteins that catalyze the assembly of other macromolecules.
