ABSTRACT

The 1999 FASEB Summer Conference on "Transcription
              Initiation in Prokaryotes" is to be held  July 3-8, 1999, at the Vermont
              Academy in Saxton's River, Vermont.  The conference is held under the auspices
              of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). 
              There will be 10 major oral sessions, each including, on average, three
              30-minute talks and two 15-minute talks.  There will be two poster sessions,
              each lasting two days.

The topics to be discussed include the structure of
              DNA-dependent RNA polymerases; physical and chemical approaches to studying
              protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in transcription; subunit
              structure, function, and catalysis; sigma factors, antisigma factors, and core
              interactions; promoters (two sessions); repression and silencing; formation and
              stability of elongation complexes; complex regulatory systems; and signal
              transduction.  The meeting focuses on eubacteria, but there will be
              consideration of both archaea and eukaryotes where comparison is
              interesting.

The purpose of the meeting is to bring together biochemists,
              biophysicists and geneticists to share information.  The field is progressing
              rapidly and providing important new information on structure and mechanisms at
              the molecular level.

This award will provide financial assistance to
              graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending the conference.
