The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Aseptic Processing and Packaging Studies is being funded for its second
              five-year cycle as a multi-university Center with the addition of a research
              site at the Ohio State University to the original North Carolina State
              University and the University of California at Davis research groups.

The
              research projects to be funded at the Center's new research site are "Microbial
              Control of Fluid Foods", "Safe Cheddar Cheese from Raw Milk", "Validating
              Sterilization Efficiency of Aseptic Packaging Systems", "Modeling of Pulsed
              Electric Field Processes" and "Process Development of Single Step Microbial and
              Colloidal Stabilization for Fermented Beverages."
