This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
              Massachusetts will provide funds for acquisition of a multibeam mapping system
              for use on Deep Submergence Vehicle Alvin and Remotely Operated Vehicles Jason
              and ARGO II.  It will provide a shared-use instrument which is expected to
              receive major use in marine geological, chemical and biological research
              worldwide, operated as part of the National Deep Submergence Facility.
