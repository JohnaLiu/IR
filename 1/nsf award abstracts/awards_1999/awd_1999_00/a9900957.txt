Functional Reactive Progamming, or FRP, is an approach
              to programming hybrid systems in a declarative style using two particular
              abstractions: a continuous (functional) model of arbitrary behaviors, and a
              discrete (reactive) calculus for user and process interaction.  FRP is a
              generalization of the fundamental ideas underlying two domain-specific
              languages that we have previously worked on: Fran, a language for functional
              reactive graphics and animation, and Frob, a language for functional robotics. 
              We believe that FRP can provide a unified framework for rapidly and reliably
              creating hybrid software systems ranging from simple behavioral loops to large
              systems involving complex control strategies and multiple interacting modules. 
              The objectives of this research are to further develop the ideas in FRP, study
              the principles underlying FRP, and explore ways to analyze, transform, and
              ultimately implement, domain-specific languages based on FRP.  The research
              will emphasize the use of techniques common in the programming language
              semantics community.  Amongst the issues to be investigated are: denotational
              as well as operational semantics for a small reactive language with continuous
              behaviors, an implementation synthesized from first principles (i.e. correct
              with respect to a specification), and practical ramifications of using
              numerical methods to simulate continuous behaviors.
