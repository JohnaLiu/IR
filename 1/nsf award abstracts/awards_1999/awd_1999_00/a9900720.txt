Abstract    :
              Evolutionary processes in nearby clusters of galaxies

James A Rose

Dr.
              Rose is conducting an observational program using the Hubble Space Telescope
              (HST), Arecibo, and Chandra (to be launched) to study individual starburst and
              post starburst galaxies in nearby clusters of galaxies.  The HST imaging and
              ground based spectroscopy with telescopes at Cerro Tololo and Kitt Peak is used
              for five nearby rich clusters, including the Coma cluster.  Arecibo is used to
              study starburst galaxies in Pegasus I, Coma, and Virgo clusters.  Data from
              Chandra will be used to study an interesting double cluster.  By combining
              global survey work with detailed studies of individual galaxies, Dr. Rose is
              identifying the evolutionary processes at work in nearby clusters, and
              evaluating the connection between the processes operating in nearby clusters
              with those responsible for the Butcher-Oemler effect.
