Abstract    :
              Athan Shaka of the University of California, Irvine is supported by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to develop a new family of pulsed
              nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments that rely on a novel approach to
              extract information from multi-dimensional time signals.  The filter
              diagonalization method (FDM) will be used as an alternative to the fast Fourier
              transform method to process raw time-domain NMR data.  Using the FDM algorithm
              procedure, the following spectral parameters will be extracted: frequencies,
              linewidths, amplitudes, and phases.  This approach is expected to lead to
              useful input for various assignment and structural refinement packages, and
              provide an opportunity to reformulate how many NMR experiments are carried out
              at the pulse sequence/data acquisition stage.   

Nuclear magnetic resonance
              spectroscopy is an analysis technique that is widely used by chemists and other
              scientists to derive structural information about molecules.  Outcomes from
              development of this new NMR analysis method are expected to have impact across
              a wide range of chemical analysis problems, ranging from routine assignment of
              spectra from large combinatorial libraries of small molecules to enabling the
              structure determinations of large biologically relevant molecules.
