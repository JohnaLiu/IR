Phase mixing in stellar systems and the nucleus of M31

Dr. Tremaine is studying two aspects of the dynamics of systems of
              stars such as galaxies and star clusters.  The first is phase mixing, the
              process by which a stellar system of collisionless plasma reaches equilibrium.
              Phase mixing is a gradual process, in which irregularities present at the
              formation of the system become more and more tightly wrapped over many orbits
              so that macroscopically the stellar system becomes smoother and smoother.  The
              persistence of these irregularities leads to several important effects that are
              investigated:  gravitational coupling between the disk and dark halo in the
              inner parts of galaxies, that may spin up and flatten the inner halo; enhanced
              relaxation near the centers of galaxies that may isotropize the stellar
              distribution function; and the presence of prominent unbound structures in the
              phase space distribution of stars.  The second is the dynamics of eccentric
              stellar disks such as the one believed to be present in the center of the
              nearby galaxy M31.  Such disks can arise naturally in a nearly Keplerian
              gravitational potential, for example close to the massive central black hole
              that is believed to sit in the centers of nearby galaxies.  Dr. Tremaine is
              studying the stability and normal modes of axisymmetric stellar disks in nearly
              Keplerian potentials, to determine whether eccentric stellar disks arise
              naturally and persist for the age of the galaxy.
