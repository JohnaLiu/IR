Abstract    :
              The search for gravitational waves requires detectors that are not overwhelmed
              by noise sources that can mask gravitational wave signals.  Thermal noise is
              one of the worst offenders.  The research program proposed by Saulson and his
              group at Syracuse University is directed toward understanding the sources of
              thermal noise that effect gravitational wave detectors and to devise methods to
              reduce the effects of these sources.
The key to reducing thermal noise
              generated by interferometer optics and test mass, and their suspension systems,
              is to design systems that minimize mechanical energy dissipation.  The Syracuse
              group will develop a means for measuring the transverse vibrations of LIGO
              optics suspension wires, and will make high sensitivity measurements of
              mechanical dissipation rates of several materials, including fused silica and
              sapphire, to determine their relative merits for use as interferometer optics
              and test masses.  They will also measure energy dissipation in a variety of
              mirror coating materials that have been proposed for LIGO optics and will
              explore the possibility of cooling these mirrors to further reduce thermal
              noise.
