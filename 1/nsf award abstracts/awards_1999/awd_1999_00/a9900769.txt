Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical physics will lie at the interface between
              elementary-particle physics and statistical physics, applying methods from both
              fields to problems in each.  Investigations in elementary-particle physics will
              focus on numerical study of quantum chromodynamics, which is the
              increasingly-confirmed detailed theory of the strong subnuclear force.  The
              interaction energy between a pair of quarks will be calculated numerically,
              with the aim of testing a recently proposed theory of quark confinement. 
              Investigations in statistical physics will focus on numerical elucidation of
              the class of phase transitions known as "critical phenomena", by developing and
              applying new and more efficient "Monte Carlo" methods of calculation.  The
              methodology involves a combination of heuristic physical reasoning, rigorous
              mathematical analysis, and systematic numerical testing.  In particular, study
              of the self-avoiding random walk will have direct applications to the behavior
              of polymer molecules in dilute solution.
