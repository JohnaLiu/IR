Roger Blandford

Dr. Blandford is conducting four
              related projects:  
1.  He is modeling individual cases of gravitational
              lenses.    There are now over thirty examples of strong gravitational lenses in
              which multiple lenses of a background source are formed primarily by the
              lensing effect of an intervening galaxy.  He is testing the hypothesis that the
              highest incidence of observed lensing arises when an elliptical galaxy resides
              in a small group.
2.  He is analyzing pencil beam surveys of high completeness
              to determine how the properties of observed galaxies are related to their
              environments.  
3.  He is developing a new model for the interpretation of
              broad absorption line quasars that associates these objects and, by extension,
              a large fraction of normal, radio-quiet quasars with black holes that are being
              supplied with gas at a super-critical rate.
4.  He is examining the
              possibility that both the slow and the fast magnetohydrodynamic shock waves
              associated with reconnection sites have an important role in relativistic
              particle acceleration in environments as diverse as radio jets, the solar
              corona and accretion disks.
