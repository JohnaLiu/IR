This project is concerned with the branching rules for quantum linear
              groups and their applications to the modular representation theory of finite
              groups.  The PI will study irreducible restrictions of irreducible modules of
              the symmetric group to its subgroups. This problem is crucial for describing
              the subgroup structure in finite simple groups.  Other applications include the
               combinatorics of the Fock space, an object important in mathematical physics. 
              We also study the two-sided ideal structure of group algebras of some locally
              finite groups, the combinatorics of partitions, partition identities, symmetric
              functions, Hecke algebras, and other topics in combinatorics.

The main area
              of research in this proposal is group theory and the representation theory of
              symmetric groups.  The symmetric group consists of all permutations of a finite
              set. It is one of the central objects in mathematics, and is extremely
              important for applications  to physics and chemistry.  Recent results
              demonstrate a strong connection between some representations of the symmetric
              group and certain restricted solid-on-solid models.
