Abstract    :
              Dr. Lange is using a new instrument called Polatron to observe partial
              polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.  Such
              polarization is predicted by theory but not yet observed.

The CMB is
              presumed to represent the imprint of the Universe that is only 3000,000 years
              old.   At that age, radiation and matter decoupled from each other, the
              Universe became transparent to radiation, material structure developed.  If the
              basic theoretical framework in which we understand the origins of CMB
              temperature anisotropies is correct, there exists a polarization field that is
              precisely correlated in amplitude and direction with the temperature anisotropy
              field.  An accurate measurement of this polarization field provides, in
              principle, as direct a probe of the initial conditions from which structure
              formed as an accurate measurement of the temperature anisotropy.  

The
              Polatron is a bolometric receiver that will measure CMB polarization at 100
              GHz..  The instrument is used at the 5.5 m telescope at the Owens Valley radio
              Observatory.
