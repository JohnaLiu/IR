Abstract    :
              A deep understanding of the phenomena observed in the strongly interacting
              many-body systems prevalent in nuclear physics, dense-matter astrophysics, and
              condensed-matter physics requires intensive ab initio investigations using
              advanced analytical and computational approaches that reach far beyond
              traditional mean-field theories.  This project continues the development and
              application of two complementary many-particle theories, the one involving
              description of fundamental correlations in terms of wave functions, basis
              states, and density matrices; and the other addressing in-medium modifications
              of particle properties and interactions in terms of one- and two-body
              propagators.  Specific applications of these methods and other techniques will
              include calculation of (e,e'p) and (e,e'2N) cross sections, construction of an
              in-medium nucleon-nucleon interaction for analysis of heavy-ion reactions,
              studies of strangeness propagation in nuclear media, quantitative evaluation of
              the properties of nucleonic superfluids in various pairing channels,
              elucidation of universal features of P-wave pairing, exploration of the role of
              exchange-symmetry breaking within an ab initio theory of Bose-Einstein
              condensation in liquid helium, and statistical prediction of nulear halflives
              and atomic masses.  In salient cases, the research will be instrumental to the
              interpretation and modeling of experimental results from electron-scattering,
              heavy-ion, and radioactive-beam facilities as well as astrophysical
              observations relating to neutron-star interiors.
