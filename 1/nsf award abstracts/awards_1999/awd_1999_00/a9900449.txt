Abstract    :
              This research examines how household computing and the
Internet are changing
              the social and psychological well being of the
American family, and compares
              the influence of these new technologies
on households with that of older
              ones--telephones and
televisions. The research objectives are (1) to determine
              whether the
early results showing that use of the Internet decreases
              psychological
and social well being generalizes across samples, Internet
              services, and
time, (2) to identify mechanism for these effects, and (3) to
              compare
the impact of different patterns of household information
              technology
use. Data will come from a national three-wave, panel survey,
              allowing one
to examine how the amount of television, telephone, computing,
              and
Internet people use at one time predict later changes in their
              social
involvement and psychological well being at a subsequent time. 
              The
survey will be supplemented with a quasi-experiment, in which a
              subsample
of respondents who have computers but no Internet access will
              be
randomly assigned free Internet access instead of a cash payments
              to
participate in the survey. Results will have implications both
              for
emerging policy debate about universal access to the Internet and for
the
              design of socially responsible Internet services.
