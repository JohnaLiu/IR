Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical gravitational physics will focus on the problem of
              quantum gravity.  Combining quantum mechanics and general relativity is one of
              the fundamental open problems in theoretical physics.  Its solution will lead
              us to understand the quantum properties of spacetime and thus to modify in
              depth the basis of our understanding of the physical world.  One of the most
              promising candidate theories of quantum gravity is loop quantum gravity.  This
              theory will be developed and analyzed, to test its validity and explore its
              physical consequences.
