Abstract    :
              This action is to support a workshop on research needs and opportunities for
              urban underground facilities, to be held at the conclusion of the Third
              National Geo-Institute Conference entitled, "Geo-Engineering for Underground
              Facilities", June 13-17, 1999, University of Illinois- Urbana.

The increased
              urbanization, population density, and traffic congestion in major urban centers
              in the United States is leading to a greater demand for underground space, such
              as new subway systems, below-ground highways, sewer tunnels, and deep parking
              garages.  These facilities are being constructed in heavily built environments,
              in confined construction areas, in difficult ground conditions, and adjacent to
              many structures that can tolerate only minimum disturbance.  The owners,
              designers, and contractors face many challenges in realizing these facilities
              under often-difficult constraints.

This workshop will identify some of the
              more pressing issues that are facing the engineering profession.  This will
              assist researchers in choosing research topics that address problems of concern
              to practicing professionals.  The workshop is aimed at stimulating a discussion
              within the engineering practice and academia to identify research priorities
              and needs in the geotechnical engineering aspects of urban underground
              construction.
