The Science Place of Dallas, TX requests $47,715 for
              "The Psychology of Music."  With this planning grant they will plan a 5,000
              square-foot permanent and traveling exhibition focusing on the psychology of
              music. The exhibition will use the universal popularity of music as the
              background to develop an exhibition focusing on:  (1) the psychological
              processes involved in perceiving and understanding music; and  (2) how we can
              use the tools and processes of science in investigating music. The exhibition
              will present basic concepts concerning the physics and perception of sound. 
              Since few interactive exhibits have been developed around the perception of
              music as sound, the planning grant will allow The Science Place to develop the
              conceptual structure for the project, develop an integrated exhibition and
              education plan, and prepare a business plan for marketing the new exhibition. 
              The planning process will include front-end audience research, a review of
              academic research on the psychology of music, a planning session with advisors,
              and dissemination of findings to the museum community.
