Abstract    :
                   This project will investigate the set of problems which must be solved to
              produce a new class of precision motion machines capable of rapidly moving over
              a planar surface and subsequently positioning to sub-micrometer precision
              without the need to provide air, power, and signals over a tether as is the
              case with today's technology.  Planar linear motors currently used in industry
              operate with a tether in an open-loop stepping manner.  This mode of operation
              makes them restricted in range of motion, susceptible to loss of steps, unable
              to reject external disturbances (such as tugs on the tether), unable to provide
              controlled forces, and unable to provide high stiffness.  A previous NSF-funded
              project produced technology advances allowing integrated robust position
              sensing and control for this class of motors, providing improved motion
              characteristics including better disturbance rejection, better resolution, and
              reduced energy consumption.  Building on these results, the present project
              will explore optimal energy utilization, innovative frictionless bearing
              design, and innovative integrated computing and communications technology to
              eliminate the need for a tether.
     Elimination of the tether will allow
              machines based on planar motors to be completely free-roaming over their
              corresponding stator surfaces.  This will enable significant improvement in the
              operation of a wide range of systems, including manufacturing systems, that are
              based on these motors.
