This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) explores
              innovative routes for the synthesis of mesoscale particles (1000 - 2000 nm in
              diameter) of iron and iron-cobalt alloys. Particles in this size range are not
              presently available and are of interest for making higher strength, more stable
              magnetorheological fluids.  Two techniques are examined to create metal
              particles in this size range.  The first is a technique based on reduction of
              metal salts using iron sulfate and cobalt chlorides as precursors.  Synthesis
              is conducted under an argon atmosphere to limit surface oxidation.  An applied
              magnetic field controls particle shape and a mixture of ethanol and water
              controls the particle size. Adsorbed water removal and improved crystallinity
              results from additional processing.  A second route to this particle size range
              employs spark erosion, and it must be determined if this process can make
              reasonable quantities of the powders.  Prof. Berkowitz at UC-San Diego assists
              in the spark erosion approach.  The particles are characterized by transmission
              electron microscopy including Lorentz microscopy.  Samples of the MR fluids
              will be prepared from the powders and characterized in a rheometer.

This
              is SGER a high-risk project aimed at creating mesoscale-sized particles of iron
              and iron-cobalt particles.  These particles are considered to be ideal for
              employment in novel, stable magnetorheologial fluids.
