Abstract    :
              Modern integrated systems are often a mixture of hardware and
              software
components. Debugging and verifying these embedded computer
              systems
requires the integration of hardware and software verification
              mechanisms.
This research is investigating methods for checking correctness of
              an
embedded system (hardware and software) design by verifying that
              a
description of the design has the proper behavior as elicited by a
              series
of input stimuli. The approach is called coverage directed validation,
              and
coverage metrics are being devised. These measure the extent of
              design
verification provided by a set of functional simulation vectors,
              which
compute statement execution counts (controllability information), and
              check
to see whether effects of possible errors activated by program stimuli
              can
be observed at the circuit outputs (observability information). In
              particular, 
the project is exploring efficient methods to compute
              observability-based
code coverage metrics that can be used for both embedded
              software and
HDL coverage.
