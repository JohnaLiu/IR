This award to Columbia University will provide equipment in
              support of oceanographic research on R/V Ewing, a research vessel operated by
              the university's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              equipment to be acquired includes a waste disposer, welder, washer,
              anti-exposure work suits, foam nozzles for fire fighting equipment, and a
              portable blower.   The shared-use equipment supported here will improve safety
              and habitability of the vessel, and assist marine scientists conduct studies
              from R/V Ewing, throughout the world ocean, during 1999 and future years.
