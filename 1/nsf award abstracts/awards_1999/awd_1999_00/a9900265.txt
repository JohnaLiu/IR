Abstract
Kim/Roush

For a long time the Williams conjecture that shift
              equivalence is the same as strong shift equivalence was the dominant approach
              to classifying subshifts of finite type.  With our negative resolution of this
              conjecture, the way is open to either determine that the invariants involved in
              that proof are a complete set, or to find new invariants and algorithms to
              effectively classify subshifts of finite type up to topological conjugacy.  We
              will consider group-theoretic, cohomological, and other methods.  We will also
              try to answer some questions raised by Nasu on his textile systems (already
              partly solved by Boyle and Maass).

Nontechnical description: Symbolic
              dynamics is a mathematical theory that can handle strings of symbols that can
              arise in many connections.  It has been used to formulate codes for efficient
              computer data storage and transmission.  It is an important and fundamental
              part of dynamical systems theory, which studies how systems (which might be
              something like the solar system, the earth's atmosphere, or the human body)
              change under time.  Symbolic dynamics has been applied to topological quantum
              field theory, which establishes a link to modern physics, and also to other
              important areas of mathematics such as the theory of knots.  The present
              proposal is primarily a project to classify subshifts of finite type, which are
              the most extensively studied kind of symbolic dynamical system.
