Centimeter wave radio spectroscopy of spiral galaxies  back
              to the big dishes

Dr. Haynes is using upgraded Arecibo antenna and the Green
              Bank Telescope to investigate the properties of spiral galaxies over a range of
              redshifts using the strong emission line in the centimeter range of the radio
              spectrum.  Four main topics are under study:  

(1)  using the 21 cm line in
              combination with optical imaging to reconstruct the density field in the local
              universe. Dr. Haynes is studying the systematics of the Tully-Fisher relation,
              particularly the effects of surface brightness, luminosity and morphology. And
              the possibility of curvature in the relation itself.  Also under investigation
              is a study of the statistical properties of the velocity field using an
              expanded sample within the declination band between 15 and +35 degrees.
(2) 
              comparing the kinematics of the HI layer derived from synthesis mapping
              observations.  Models obtained from HI synthesis maps are compared with
              hydrodynamic numerical models of disk galaxies embedded in dark matter
              potentials.
(3)   using the Tully-Fisher technique to determine the
              possibility of evolution of the mass-to-light ratio of galaxies as a function
              of redshift.  This includes the use of  the 21 cm line for galaxies with
              redshifts between 0.08 and 0.33.
(4)  conducting pilot searches for
              intergalactic HI and IH maser emission at high redshift.
