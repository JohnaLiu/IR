Mobile Manipulation

This is the first year funding of a three
              year continuing award. The goal of this research is to explore the boundary
              between robotic manipulation and robotic locomotion.  The initial focus is on a
              simple robot called the Mobipulator which manipulates paper and other common
              desktop objects using its wheels both for locomotion and manipulation.
Some of
              the goals are to refine and test variations on the design, to explore
              theoretical kinematic and dynamic properties of the device, and to develop
              suitable planning and control techniques.
