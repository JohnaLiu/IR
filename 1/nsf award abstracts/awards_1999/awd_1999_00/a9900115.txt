Dynamic Contextual Recognition of Moving Objects

This is a standard
              award of three years. The research will address the problem of reconstructing
              the paths taken by all moving objects that are temporarily visible from
              multiple non-overlapping cameras in an environment. There are many interesting
              surveillance applications where it is important to integrate information from
              multiple cameras. Unfortunately, it is very difficult and tiring for human
              operators to simultaneously attend to several video streams. The PI will take a
              Bayesian approach, where the optimal solution is the set of object paths with
              the highest posterior probability
given the observed data.  The PI plans to
              investigate the use of combinatorial
optimization methods, including linear
              programming and graph cuts, to design
approximation schemes for these
              problems. These methods are expected to 
result in efficient algorithms with
              interesting guarantees concerning the
quality of the approximation.
