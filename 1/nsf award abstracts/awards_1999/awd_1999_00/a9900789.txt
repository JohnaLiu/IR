Abstract    :
              
Dr.Kennicutt is studying the evolutionary properties of nearby galaxies by
              determining star formation rates.  This information is important for solving a
              wide range of broad problems, including star formation, the physical nature of
              the Hubble sequence, and the formation and evolution of galaxies. 
              Specifically, Dr. Kennicutt is conducting  (1) a detailed study of the
              relationship between the star formation rate and the density and dynamics of
              the interstellar gas, based on a new interferometric survey of the molecular
              gas in a sample of 44 nearby galaxies using the new BIMA facility (BIMA is the
              Berkeley, Illinois, Maryland Array) to look at a particular transition in
              carbon monoxide;  (2) a high resolution study of the interstellar gas and star
              formation in the central kiloparsec regions of these galaxies; (3) a study of
              the radial evolution of star formation in galactic disks based on multicolor
              and Ha imaging of nearby spiral galaxies; (4) a study of the Ha luminosity
              function and the local cosmological start formation density; and (5) a
              calibration of the quantitative diagnostics of star formation rates and
              chemical abundances in galaxies.
