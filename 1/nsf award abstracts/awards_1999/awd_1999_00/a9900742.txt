Abstract    :
              Ancient and recent galaxy mergers

Francois Schweizer

Collisions and
              mergers of galaxies in the past seem to have played a major role in determining
              the shapes and dynamics of present day galaxies.  Though the number of galactic
              mergers has declined with time, a few such mergers are still occurring and
              offer us valuable clues to past evolutionary processes.  Dr. Schweizer is
              determining the dates of ancient and recent merger events in nearby galaxies. 
              Discoveries of young globular star clusters apparently formed during mergers
              have made possible a new method for dating the merger events themselves. 
              Because of the coeval stars, globular clusters are more easily dated than whole
              galaxies.  Dr. Schweizer is conducting six projects: (1) an analysis of images
              of six merger galaxies to search young to intermediate age globular clusters in
              them; (2) establish a globular cluster chronology; (3) determine the large
              scale spatial distribution of the clusters; (4) measure metallicities and ages
              of these clusters; (5) map the velocities of the stars and gas in three merger
              galaxies to determine the merger dynamics; and (6) search for a remnant
              galactic wind and possible large scale shock fronts in the merger remnant NGC
              7252.  These projects address key questions on the origins of galaxies, the
              ages and metallicities of globular clusters in them, the formation of oddly
              rotating cores in merger remnants, and the fate of gas during mergers.
