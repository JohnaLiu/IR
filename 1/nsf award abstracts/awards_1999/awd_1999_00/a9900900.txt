Abstract    :
              Partial travel support for invited speakers and U.S. young researchers
              participating at the "Nanocomposite Materials: Design and Applications"
              conference in Girdwood (Anchorage), Alaska, from March 28 to April 2, 1999, has
              been requested.  The objective of this meeting is to evaluate the current
              research results in the field, and discuss future research directions and
              technological developments.   Engineers, chemists and physicists from academe
              and industry will attempt to identify common principles and approaches and
              develop collaborations.  The conference is organized in nine technical
              sections, including overviews, synthesis, theory, characterization, various
              properties, and applications.  Established and young researchers from Americas,
              Europe, Japan and Russia will participate.  There will be about 40 invited
              speakers.   This workshop is addressing topics related to nanoscale structures,
              critical length scales for given properties, tailored assembling of the
              nanoscale building blocks, and various areas of application.   Ample time will
              be allowed for questions and discussions.  A purpose of the meeting is to
              facilitate the establishment of long term cooperation among researchers in
              academe and industry in the area of nanocomposite materials.
