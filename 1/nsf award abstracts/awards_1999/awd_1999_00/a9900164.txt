Abstract    :
                   This grant provides funding for the development of a comprehensive
              framework for stochastic simulation input modeling that can accomplish the
              following:  (1) represent a wide range of steady-state simulation input models,
              including independent univariate processes, finite-dimensional random vectors,
              stationary univariate time-series processes, and stationary vector-time-series
              processes; (2) fit these input models to data via automated algorithms while
              enabling intuitive, direct modification of the fitted models via the
              user's
subjective judgment or partial information such as bounds, percentiles,
              or moments; (3) generate realizations of these input processes quickly and
              accurately in order to drive large-scale computer  simulations; and (4)
              facilitate sensitivity analysis of simulation outputs with respect to
              simulation inputs by making the input models readily adjustable in terms of
              easily understood parameters.  The framework will be based on the ability to
              represent, fit, and generate observations from a stationary multivariate vector
              time series in which each individual component can have either a Johnson,
              Bezier, or discrete marginal distribution; moreover, the dependence structure
              is specified via product-moment correlations between pairs of components that
              are separated by selected time lags.  Such an input process will be constructed
              by an appropriate transformation of a Gaussian vector autoregressive process.

                 The primary benefit of this research is that it will take reliable input
              modeling out of the domain of statistical specialists and put it into the hands
              of everyday simulation users.  Simulation inputs form the core of every
              stochastic simulation model, so this will substantially improve the fidelity of
              practical simulation models, leading to more accurate results and better
              decisions.  Since simulation analysts use what they find in software, the
              software developed in this research and made available to commercial
              vendors
should speed the technology transfer.
