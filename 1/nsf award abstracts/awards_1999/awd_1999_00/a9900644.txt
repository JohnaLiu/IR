A study will be undertaken of the dynamics of gravitating
              systems in axisymmetry in which the gravitational field is very strong.  In
              particular, dynamical situations will be studied in which the collapsing field
              configuration is strong enough to form a very small black hole.  Advanced
              numerical code will be developed in order to investigate critical phenomena at
              the threshold of black hole formation in axisymmetric collapse.  This model
              will be used to test the stability of exactly critical, self-similar solutions
              found previously in spherical symmetry.  It will study the collapse of highly
              distorted scalar field and gravitational wave configurations.  It will also
              begin an investigation of the role of rotation in critical gravitational
              collapse.  Ongoing studies of critical phenomena in spherically symmetric
              collapse will also continue.

This work will increase our understanding of
              realistic gravitational collapse within the context of general relativity.  It
              will also shed light on other astrophysical processes in which the
              gravitational field plays a very significant role.  This deeper and increased
              understanding of some of the strong-field, non-linear aspects of gravity has
              the potential to help in understanding some of the data which will come soon
              from gravitational wave detectors such as the LIGO project.
