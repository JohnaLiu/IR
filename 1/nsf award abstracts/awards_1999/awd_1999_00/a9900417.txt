Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Weisman will investigate the dynamics and photophysics of
              triplet spectroscopic states of both gas-phase and solution-phase molecules. 
              The gas-phase studies will extend investigations of triplet collision dynamics
              to pyrimidine, pyridine, sym-triazine, and naphthalene in order to understand
              the dependence of triplet-state lifetime on excess energy.  Time-resolved
              optical absorption spectroscopy will be used to gather data.  These data will
              be analyzed using Master Equation simulations to provide results that can be
              more easily compared with theoretical calculations.  The energetics and
              dynamics of solution-phase fullerene triplet-state molecules will be examined
              using transient absorption, photoacoustic, and emission spectroscopic
              measurements.  Molecules to be studied include C60, C70, and higher fullerenes.
               The results will form a data base of photophysical properties for
              understanding excited-state behavior in these compounds and for planning and
              optimizing potential fullerene applications.

Triplet states of polyatomic
              molecules are important to investigate because such molecules typically persist
              much longer than the molecule's other excited states while displaying increased
              tendencies for chemical reaction, electron transfer, and energy transfer.  The
              identity of the excited state that a molecule can find itself in can also
              determine or alter the course or efficiency of a particular chemical reaction
              of interest.  The studies in this project are of fundamental interest, but they
              can also impact practical applications, such as optical data storage systems
              using fullerene-derived compounds.
