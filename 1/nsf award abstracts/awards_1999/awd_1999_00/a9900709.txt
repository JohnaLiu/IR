Under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research,
              Drs. Stern and Slater will carry out a novel experiment to attempt to detect
              the presence of lunar water.  The technique is based on detecting H2O's primary
              dissociation product, OH, by measuring the absorption of sunlight as it passes
              through OH in the lunar atmosphere during the next total solar eclipse on 11
              August 1999.   The eclipse team will travel to Turkey for the observations,
              where it is predicted to have the best weather to view the eclipse.  Images
              taken alternately through an OH 0-0 band filter and an off-band continuum
              filter during the period between 1st and 2nd and between 3rd and 4th contact
              will be analyzed for an OH absorption signal.
