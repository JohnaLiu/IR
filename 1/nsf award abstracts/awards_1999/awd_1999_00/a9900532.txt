The eleventh Conversation in Biomolecular
              Stereodynamics
will meet at the State University of New York, Albany
from
              June 15-19, 1999.  This meeting is to feature general lectures as
well as
              poster discussion papers, covering subject areas ranging from 
nuclear
              receptor DNA computing.  A total of 60 lecturers, evenly distributed
among
              senior and young investigators, in addition to graduate students
              and
postdoctoral fellows are expected to attend the event along with 500
              scientists 
from over 20 countries. This series of "Conversations" has been
              shown to be an
excellent forum for exchanging ideas and information in
              Molecular Biophysics.  
An impact of the upcoming meeting on the development
              of new concepts and 
promotion of collaborations is anticipated.
