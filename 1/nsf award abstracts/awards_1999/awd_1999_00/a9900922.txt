The
              increasing automation of critical applications is imposing increasing demands
              on software capabilities and assurance levels.  To handle these challenges,
              several methods have been proposed to decompose requirements specifications
              into disjoint pieces that can be implemented independently.  However, most of
              these methods do not directly facilitate the assessment of the resulting
              system.  This research focuses on IDEAL (Independently Developable End-user
              Assessable Logical) components, i.e., components that can be analyzed,
              developed, and evaluated independently by the end-user.  To compose a system of
              IDEAL components, each component is relational (returns all possible outputs
              for a given input).  This approach has several
significant advantages,
              including high reliability and safety assurance, automated composition, and
              support for multiparadigm control strategies.  A formal foundation for the
              existence of relational programs for several classes of applications will be
              developed.  A library of heuristic rules, data types, operations, and
              coordination schemes will be developed to facilitate the writing of efficient
              relational programs.  Methods will be developed to infer the properties
              (performance, reliability, safety, and stability) of a system of IDEAL
              components from the properties of its components.  These will result in a
              rigorous and practical approach for achieving certifiable high assurance for
              critical applications.
