Abstract    :
              This proposal aims at developing novel particulate composites using cenospheres
              in a polymer or cement matrix and characterizing their mechanical (constitutive
              and fracture) and thermal properties. Cenospheres being reclaimed product from
              the fly ash of the thermal power plants, are inexpensive and their use in a
              scientific manner as envisaged in this proposal would result in material
              conservation and also reduce environmental problems asociated with their
              disposal in landfills. A comprehensive processing scheme for preparing these
              composites will be developed for both the polymer and cement matrices. The
              hollow ceramic cenospheres are ideally suited to make light weight material
              and, the effect of the cenosphere content, size and their distribution in the
              matrix on the resulting material properties will be investigated in detailed.
              Suitable cenosphere surface treatments will be investigated to tailor the
              interaction at the cenosphere-matrix interface and the effect of such interface
              customization on the material properties will be studied. Based on these
              investigations, suitable models for design and synthesis of cenosphere
              composites will be developed. The results will also provide a basic for
              developing and valading constitutiive failure models based on continuum or
              micromechanical theories for particular composites. The synergiistic effect of
              combining cenosphere characteristics with those imparted by the continuous
              matrix can be exploited for a range of applications, including light weight
              impact resistant and energy absorbing materials and structures, high specific
              strength materialss for construction of boats and civil structures and light
              weight thermal insulation materials.***
