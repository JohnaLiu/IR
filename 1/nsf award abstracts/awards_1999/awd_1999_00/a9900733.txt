              QSO absorption lines and comsology

Absorption lines
              observed in the spectra of quasars provide a way to study the interstellar gas
              in galaxies and gas in the intergalactic medium along the line of sight to the
              quasar.  Dr. Sargent is extending observations and analyses in a program of
              quasar absorption line studies.  He is using the High Resolution Echelle
              Spectrograph (HIRES) on the Keck 10 meter telescopes.  There are three
              objectives: 
(1)  to study the evolution of the heavy element content of
              galaxies and the intergalactic medium as a function of cosmic time from
              redshift about 5 (when the universe was about 10% of its present age) forward
              to the present epoch; 
(2)  to study the structure of the gas in galaxies and
              intergalactic space on scales ranging from 10pc to 100kpc using the absorption
              lines observed in multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars or quasar
              pairs, and 
(3)  to study the cosmical evolution of the meta-galactic flux of
              UV radiation  capable of ionizing hydrogen.  This investigation addresses the
              relative importance of the contributions of quasars and galaxies to the
              ionizing flux at different cosmic epochs.
