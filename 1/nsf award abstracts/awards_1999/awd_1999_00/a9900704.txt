The objectives of this research planning visit are to 1)
              contact New Caledonian collaborators, 2) lay the groundwork for the final
              proposal, 3) preview potential collection sites with reference to logistics and
              costs of access and conduct preliminary sampling of the fungi, 4) explore costs
              and availability of New Caledonian field assistants and students, and 5) work
              with Dr. Andrew Claridge, Canberra, National Parks and Wildlife Service, to
              identify the fungi collected in a preceding visit to New Caledonia and to
              develop the final proposal.  The ultimate goal of the research will be to
              determine the diversity and speciation of New Caledonian hypogeous fungi and to
              integrate molecular data for selected species of the genus Hysterangium of
              Australia. The New Caledonian counterpart is Dr. Tanguy Jaffre of  L'Institut
              Francais de Recherche Scientifique Pour Le Development & Cooperation.
