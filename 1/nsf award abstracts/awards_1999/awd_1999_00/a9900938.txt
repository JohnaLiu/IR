Abstract    :
              Partial travel support for speakers at the IUTAM Symposium "Segregation in
              Granular Flow", June 5-10, 1999 in Cape May, NJ, is provided.  Evaluation of
              the current research results in a field in development and improving
              interdisciplinary and international interactions are the main objectives. 
              Engineers, physicists and mathematicians will identify common principles and
              approaches.  The symposium is organized into three technical sessions,
              including experiments, analytical theories and computational approaches. 
              Established and young researchers from over ten countries will participate. 
              There will be about 25 speakers and 50 participants.  The conference
              proceedings will be prepared following the meeting, and published by Kluwer
              Academic Press.  This workshop is addressing a less understood phenomenon in
              granular flow, and has a significant industrial relevance.  The workshop is
              expected to be an interactive forum for participants, particularly young
              researchers, to debate actual technical issues, collaborations and professional
              activities.
