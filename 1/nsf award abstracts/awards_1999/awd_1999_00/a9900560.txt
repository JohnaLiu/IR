Abstract    :
              This project consists of a broad range of laboratory experiments on the growth
              and evaporation of ice crystals and the analysis of existing cloud data
              collected by aircraft.  One set of experiments will simulate the conditions of
              crystal growth in cirrus clouds.  Modifications to an existing cloud chamber
              will permit temperatures as cold as -100 C, pressures as low as 1 mb, and
              supersaturations with respect to ice as high as 200%.  The chamber will be
              modified to permit the examination of impurities, in particular oxides of
              nitrogen, on crystal habit.  Results for these experiments will contribute to
              the understanding of crystal growth at the extreme conditions in cirrus clouds
              in the high atmosphere.  Another set of experiments at temperatures around 0 C
              will be designed to study aspects of particle growth, melting, and evaporation
              relevant to the melting layer of snow.  Emphasis will be on conditions with
              high supersaturations with respect to water, to simulate ice as it falls and
              melts in air with and without cloud droplets.  Electrical effects and secondary
              ice production will be monitored.  Data from the CALJET and SHEBA projects
              using the airborne "cloudscope" instrument will be compared with laboratory
              results on both the cirrus cloud and the melting layer simulations.
