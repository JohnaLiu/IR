Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology supports the research of Professor Andrei Tokmakoff. 
              The theme of the research is the investigation of the ultrafast dynamics of
              water and aqueous solutes using one- and two-dimensional vibrational
              spectroscopies.  The collective dynamics of neat water and variable H2O/D2O
              mixtures will be probed using two-dimensional Raman experiments which are
              sensitive to heterogeneity and to the mechanism of coupling between vibrations.
               Polarization-selective one-dimensional Raman experiments on all elements of
              the tensorial response will be used to separate rotational, translational, and
              coupled intermolecular motions.  Infrared pump-probe experiments on aqueous
              solutes will be used to probe solute-solvent interactions.  Systematic
              experiments in water will be used to understand the mechanism of intermolecular
              relaxation and determine which motions of water preferentially couple to solute
              vibrations.

Results from this project will help understand the details of
              interactions between and within molecules and will help explain how these
              interactions give rise to the properties and overall chemical reactivity
              displayed by materials in the bulk.  Such an understanding can lead to the
              ability to predict the outcome of chemical reactions and physical processes in
              condensed phases of matter.
