Abstract    :
              The PI is organizing a Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry in
              Newport, RI on June 13-17, 1999. This Gordon Research Conference is one of the
              major meetings in this field. This year, the conference will cover a broad
              range of areas in atmospheric chemistry, including the evolution of the
              atmosphere, chemistry and climate, nucleation processes, chemistry and aerosol
              formation, heterogeneous chemistry, stratospheric chemistry and transport, the
              global atmosphere, regional air quality, and convection and global oxidation.
              The meeting will be attended by both established researchers and young
              scientists, among them the participants of the preceding Atmospheric Chemistry
              Colloquium for Emerging Senior Scientists (ACCESS).
