Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the design and implementation of algorithms for
              solving large linear systems of equations using direct methods.  In particular,
              the focus is on the problem of finding the order in which variables should be
              eliminated during the course of Gaussian elimination.  The goal is to develop
              algorithms that are both provably efficient and highly tuned for the types of
              matrices that arise in operations research and scientific computing.  The work
              has both analytical and experimental components.  On the analytical side, it
              involves rigorous evaluation of performance of known ordering algorithms such
              as the minimum-degree heuristic, on specific classes of graphs, such as
              interval graphs and grid graphs.  The aim is to understand when and why these
              algorithms work well in practice.  On the experimental side, it involves
              implementation of software for finding elimination orders that is competitive
              with state-of-the art implementations of the minimum-degree, nested dissection,
              and hybrid algorithms.
