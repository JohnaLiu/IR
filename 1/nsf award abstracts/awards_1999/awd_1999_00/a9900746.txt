Abstract    :
              	The project explores a broad class of problems involving non-linear, strongly
              coupled or perturbed systems.  In all of these problems, analytic solutions are
              typically absent and boundary conditions and geometry play a major role. 
              Systems to be explored include Rydberg atoms in strong electromagnetic fields
              and ballistic electron transport in microstructures.  As always the object is
              understand how the quantum world mirrors the phenomenon known as classical
              chaos.
