Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed program is to encourage the participation of
              physics undergraduate and first-year graduate students at the American Physical
              Society (APS) Centennial meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, March 20-26, 1999. 
              Physics Departments throughout the nation will be notified that $250 matching
              grants are available to support the travel and subsistence of students selected
              to attend and participate in the Centennial Celebration.  It is hoped that with
              the appropriate funding approximately 320 undergraduate and first-year graduate
              students would be able to attend and benefit from this unique meeting.  The APS
              expects that this opportunity will give talented students the chance to
              experience their chosen field of study in a different setting and to meet
              distinguished and eminent leaders in physics.  This activity is jointly
              supported by the Divisions of Physics (PHY), Materials Research (DMR),
              Undergraduate Education (DUE), and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
              (OMA).
