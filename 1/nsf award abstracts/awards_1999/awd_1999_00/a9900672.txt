A diversified program of research in relativity and
              relativistic astrophysics will be carried out at Cornell.  A large component of
              the research is aimed at the numerical solution of Einstein's equations by
              supercomputer simulations.  One focus is to track the coalescence and merger of
              binary black hole systems and to calculate the gravitational waveform emitted
              by such processes.  Another focus is to do the same thing for binary neutron
              star systems.  Codes for treating neutron stars and black holes in full general
              relativity share many common features, and it makes sense to develop them in
              parallel.  There are still significant theoretical and algorithmic issues to be
              solved before a stable code can be developed, and these problems will be
              tackled.  in addition, the stability of rotating neutron stars and the fate of
              unstable spinning stars will also be investigated.  A key motivation for this
              research is that mergers of binary black hole and neutron star systems are
              primary targets for gravitational wave detectors currently under construction,
              such as LIGO, and there is an urgent need for reliable waveforms. 
              Understanding binary neutron star systems may also be crucial to resolving a
              number of astrophysical puzzles, such as the origin of gamma-ray bursts and
              planets around pulsars.  Understanding the stability of rotating neutron stars
              is crucial to determining the maximum mass and rotation rate of neutron stars,
              as well as the outcomes of spin-up by accretion and binary merger.
