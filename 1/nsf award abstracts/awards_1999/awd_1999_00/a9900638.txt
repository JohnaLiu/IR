The key factors controlling the soid-state microstructure and
              crystallization of polymer blends are less well understood than those of neat
              semi-crystalline systems, due in part to the inherent complexity of such
              mixtures. Recent work by the PI (using principally small angle x-ray scattering
              measurements) on model melt-miscible blends containing weakly-and
              strongly-interacting amorphous polymers has provided insight into the factors
              that influence the final microstructure in these systems. This initial work,
              along with other preliminary experiments, point to a number of important
              directions for further research.

The proposed research falls into two main
              areas. The primary focus is on developing a fundamental understanding of
              crystallization and microstructure development of poly(ethylene oxide) [PEO" in
              model blends. This aspect of the work will be conducted primarily using
              simultaneous small-and wide-angle x-ray scattering experiments. In addition,
              the PI will undertake a parallel study of the kinetics of spherulitic growth of
              PEO in blends, with particular emphasis on the influence of strong
              intermolecular interactions. The second focus area concerns the relationship
              between the solid-state structure of single crystalline and melt-crystallized
              PEO and blends, and their dielectric relaxation behavior. The principles
              derived from this work should be completlely general and provide a basis for
              optimal tailoring of properties in multicomponent polymer systems.
