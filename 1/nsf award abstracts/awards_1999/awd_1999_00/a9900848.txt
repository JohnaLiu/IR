Funding is provided to try to validate recent theories on
              instability dynamics in the tropical oceans. The motivation for this
              undertaking is the existence of a perfectly matched set of data obtained during
              a cruise of opportunity in the instability wave region of the eastern tropical
              Pacific in late august 1994. The importance of this data set arises from the
              very fortuitous timing of the cruise, one week prior to the onset of tropical
              instability waves as viewed from
satellite observations. Given the rapid
              e-folding time of these waves (2-3 weeks), this equatorial snapshot is our best
              view to date of a mature, unstable background state just before the presence of
              the waves has significantly modified its characteristics. This unique data set
              will be analyzed an utilized along with appropriate satellite imagery to
              realistically configure and run stability models of the equatorial region.
