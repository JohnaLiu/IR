              ABSTRACT

OCE-9900310


In this project, the principal investigator will
              organize a three-year set of experiments in which leading chemical tracer
              transport models from around the world would be used in intercomparison to
              calculate the global carbon budget of the atmosphere through inversion
              techniques.  There are three objectives:  (1)  to quantify the uncertainty in
              the oxygen budget arising from differences in simulated transport; (2) to
              diagnose the mechanisms that produce these differences; and (3) to recommend
              and prioritize improvements to the models and the observing network to reduce
              this source of uncertainty.  These studies should significantly improve
              understanding of the global carbon budget, especially its atmospheric
              components, and the fate of anthropogenic CO2.
