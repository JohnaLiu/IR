The
              objective is microscopic and macroscopic evaluation of the performance of
              filter media for sub-micron particles and droplets using nanofibers in addition
              to the regular fibers.  Nanofibers will be generated by electrospinning.   The
              pressure drop and particle capture efficiency will be compared for various
              filter configurations.  The threshold between two flow patterns,
              droplet/particle flow and diffusion through porous medium, will be determined. 
              The effect of fiber electrical properties and fiber charging, as well as the
              effect of acoustical fields on coalescence efficiency will be investigated. 
              This is a GOALI (Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry)
              collaborative project between the University of Akron and AirMaze Corporation
              and a group of other six companies which will provide both in kind and cash
              contributions to the project.  

The research has relevance for filtration
              technology, with applications from clean room technology to water purification
              membranes.
