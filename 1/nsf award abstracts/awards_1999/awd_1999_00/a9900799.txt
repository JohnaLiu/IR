Puff
Dr. Puff is developing a biosynthetic Radiation Detector capable
              of measuring low level radiation.  By depositing a double single-stranded DNA
              on small polystyrene beads, the surface area of such detector is greatly
              increased.  The broken DNA molecules can be easily collected with a filtering
              system.
