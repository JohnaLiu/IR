Abstract    :
              The lack of availability of design guidelines and technical data for the use of
              carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) reinforcements has contributed
              significantly to the delay in using composites materials in prestressed
              concrete bridges in the US.  Consequently, no single prestressed concrete
              bridge using CFRP has been constructed or even considered by any government
              agency.  As a result, the use of CFRP reinforcements in the US has been limited
              to research activities and subsequent technical publications.  The proposed
              research program is tailored to develop design guidelines to aid the designers
              to safely desin CFRP prestressed structural components, and to construct a
              one-half scale bridge model and two prestressed concrete girders and test them
              under different loading conditions.  The proposed investigation will result in
              technical data that will be adopted in the construction of the first authorized
              CFRP prestressed concrete bridge inn the US.  Furthermore, future prestressed
              concrete bridge projects that will be undertaken by the supporting state
              agencies will benefit signigicantly from the generated data.
