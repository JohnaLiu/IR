Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on the
              phenomenology of supersymmetric theories (which relate the basic forces to the
              constituents of matter), other possible extensions of the very successful
              "standard model" of particle physics, the properties of excited baryons in a
              promising approximation called the large N_c limit, and the production of
              "pion" particles in energetic collisions of photons with matter.  The standard
              model is the most successful description of elementary particles and their
              interactions, but leaves many questions unanswered.  These can only be
              addressed by considering extensions to this basic picture, as in supersymmetric
              theories.  Excited baryons are observed particles whose properties may shed
              light on our understanding of the theory of the strong nuclear force.  The
              interactions of photons with matter will allow us to understand the basic
              structure of the nucleus of atoms.  All these matters are important in
              unraveling the basic nature of matter.
