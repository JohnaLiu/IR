A liquid sodium simulation of the alpha-omega dynamo created during galactic
              black hole formation

Stirling Colgate

The PI is conducting a laboratory
              experiment that reproduces an analog to some of the astrophysical phenomena
              seen in active galaxies.  The experimental technique is based on the concept
              that the alpha effect of the alpha-omega dynamo is created by expanding plumes
              that untwist within a rotating frame.  This type of dynamo forms from (1)
              differential rotation within a Keplerian disk - the omega deformation, and (2)
              the plumes ejected to large height from the disk by star-disk collisions - the
              alpha deformation.  The analog of these astrophysical flows can be created in
              the laboratory in a conducting fluid - liquid sodium in this case. .  The
              dynamo can be modeled in the laboratory because the flows are coherent, driven
              flows  Dr. Colgate is testing  this new concept with a liquid sodium experiment
              in order to  apply the results to the origin of the magnetic fields of the
              Universe generated within the accretion disk close to the central black hole
              suspected to be at the center of many galaxies.
