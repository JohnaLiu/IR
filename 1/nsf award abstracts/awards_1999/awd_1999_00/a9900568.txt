Abstract    :
              The investigators will explore the possibility that there are systematic changes
              in the diameter of the sun on timescales ranging from years to centuries. Such
              changes, and their consequent effect on total solar irradiance, can affect
              weather and/or climate. The main effort is to conduct a detailed analysis of
              data obtained on flights of the Solar Disk Sextant, a balloon borne instrument
              first operated in 1992. Analysis of individual flights has demonstrated that
              the instrument is capable of measuring the solar diameter to the required
              precision of one part in 100,000, but systematic effects have to date resulted
              in flight to flight variations much larger than this. In the present project,
              the principal investigator will work in collaboration with experts on the
              calibration of optical astronomical instruments to understand and correct for
              the systematic effects in past data. If this effort is successful, more flights
              of the payload will be made in collaboration with the NASA Goddard Space Flight
              Center.
