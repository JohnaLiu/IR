Abstract    :
                  This grant provides funding to investigate interactive physically-based
              geometric algorithms for real-time haptic simulation, namely interactive force
              display with efficient contact determination.  The specific research issues to
              be investigated include: (1) design of new algorithms for real-time collision
              detection  between complex geometric models; (2) computation of penetration 
              depth at interactive rates for calculating contact or restoring forces; (3)
              improved computational efficiency of contact determination algorithms for
              flexible models undergoing deformation; (4) integration of all the algorithmic
              advances gained from the proposed research and a proof-of-concept demonstration
              using haptic simulation; (5) verification of their utility in other design and
              engineering applications; and (6) rapid dissemination of the research results
              by releasing public domain software packages based on the prototype software
              implementations and by transferring  the technology to commercial vendors.
   
               The goal of this research is to improve the performance of underlying  contact
              determination algorithms for force display by at least an order of magnitude,
              in order to sustain interactive haptic simulations and to enable natural
              manipulation of 3D CAD models.  Successful completion of the proposed research
              can have considerable impact in promoting haptic simulation as a new
              interaction paradigm for three-dimensional engineering design.  Other than
              haptic simulation for engineering design, these algorithms will also be useful
              for tolerance analysis and maintainability studies in virtual prototyping and
              design automation.
