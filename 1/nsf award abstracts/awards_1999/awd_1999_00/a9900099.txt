Database Formulation and Design Enhancement Initiatives
              
for Floor Vibration Assessment

Many lightweight floor systems experience
              excessive levels of vibration
caused by normal occupant activities such as
              walking, dancing, aerobics,
etc. Improving the structural designer's ability
              to provide an acceptable
floor system is the subject of this research
              initiative.  The scope of this
research is defined under four research subject
              headings: 1) Floor
vibration case studies: A minimum of ten floor vibration
              case studies are
being studied to provide researchers, including the PI, with
              a more
extensive database on the vibration behavior of in-place steel
              floor
systems; 2) Research on ballroom floors: Several high profile
              ballroom
facilities have been receiving negative attention in the press for
              their
disturbing levels of floor vibration.  The cause of these problems is
              under
investigation and possible solutions are being sought; 3)
              Utilizing
computer software in the design process: Research is being
              undertaken to
study the use of general purpose structural design and analysis
              software in
the evaluation of floor system designs; 4)  Supplemental design
              criteria:
This research is targeted toward refining specific portions of the
              Design
for Walking Excitation criterion to aid the designer in
              predicting
unacceptable floors.
