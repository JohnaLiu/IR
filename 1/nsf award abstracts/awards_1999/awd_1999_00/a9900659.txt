Abstract    :
              The project explores the nature of certain solitary wave solutions to the
              coupled non-linear Schroedinger equation.  Previous research has found some
              elegant, analytic representations in terms of Lame functions.  The methodology
              will be explored for more general non-linear equations and be applied to
              problems in the field of optical communication and Bose-Einstein
              condensation.
