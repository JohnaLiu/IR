RNA synthesis, chemistry, structure and function are central
              to the viability of all biological systems and thus are important to
              agricultural, medical, and environmental research. This research has led to
              biotechnological applications of RNA as both tool and target. New and exciting
              RNA structures have been discovered and are revealing  new modes of
              interactions with proteins, other RNA's, DNA, and small molecules capable of
              disrupting RNA function. The Symposium on RNA Biology III, "RNA: Tool and
              Target", will replicate the format and focus of the highly successful symposium
              on the same topic held in 1997. The focus will be the biochemical and molecular
              interactions of RNA and RNA-protein complexes and their potential applications
              in areas important to society. This meeting will create an intimate environment
              for intellectual exchange and a forum for sharing data, techniques, and 
              biotechnological applications.

The symposium has the following objectives:
              (1) Promoting communication in the important research area of RNA interactions;
              (2) Providing an educational experience for postdoctoral fellows and graduate
              students in a setting conducive to open discussions with established
              investigators who have broad experience in the RNA field; (3) Stimulating
              discussion and the sharing of ideas and techniques by established investigators
               as well as by postdoctoral fellows and students; and (4) Bringing researchers
              to a venue where three major universities, federal research institutions and
              laboratories, and many corporate research centers are located. The principal
              site for the meeting will be the North Carolina Biotechnology Center in
              Research Triangle Park, NC, a  state supported center recognized for
              knowledge-based biotechnology development.

This award will provide  stipend
              and travel funds for five more junior
              investigators.
