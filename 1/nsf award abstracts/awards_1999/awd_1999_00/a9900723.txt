Polarization structure and evolution of compact extragalactic
              radio jets

Hugh D Aller

Dr. Aller is conducting weekly single dish linear
              polarization and flux density measurements with the 26 meter University of
              Michigan paraboloid, and bi-monthly VLBI/P polarimetry observations.  Nineteen
              sources are followed.  Past observations have shown that flux and polarization
              variability is an all pervasive and underlying feature of extragalactic
              objects.

In addition Dr. Aller is developing new radiative transfer models
              incorporating the development of oblique shocks in the relativistic flow.  The
              goal of the program is to learn about the structure and evolution of highly
              collimated, relativistic jets with the specific goal of determining whether
              oblique shocks can account for the range of behavior found in observations of
              the temporal variations in polarization structure or whether an additional
              mechanism, shear, must be invoked to explain the long term stability.
