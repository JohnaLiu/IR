Networks of workstations (NOWs) provide an
              inexpensive alternative to parallel computers.  An important problem in
              parallel computing is that of efficient support for collective communication
              operations. The objective of this study is to develop efficient techniques for
              collective communication in networks of workstations. Specifically, the
              research comprises three fundamental components. First, efficient communication
              techniques are investigated in systems with little or no hardware support for
              collective communication operations.  Second, hardware-supported techniques are
              investigated for collective communication in NOWs.  Third, portable and
              flexible simulation tools are implemented to analyze a variety of communication
              techniques in networks of workstations under traffic generated by real parallel
              applications.  The design of efficient collective communication operations in
              NOWs has a direct impact on improving the performance of numerous parallel
              computing applications.
