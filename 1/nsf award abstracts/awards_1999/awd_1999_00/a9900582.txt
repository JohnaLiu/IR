Drs. Peterson, of
              Astrophysical Advances, and Terndrup, at the Ohio State University, will carry
              out a collaborative project to survey the Galactic bulge for hot stars, those
              with temperatures in excess of 20,000 K, that are thought to be the source of
              the excess Ultraviolet light found in old, metal-rich extragalactic systems. 
              These stars have presented a puzzle, since such stars are not found in the
              metal-rich systems of globular clusters in our galaxy, yet are apparently
              common in elliptical galaxies and the bulges of other spiral galaxies.  This
              photometric and spectroscopic survey will take a complete census of several
              fields in the bulge of our galaxy, where preliminary work has uncovered a
              statistically significant sample of these hot stars, and where large enough
              samples of a metal-rich population can be obtained to identify stars in
              short-lived phases of stellar evolution.  The survey will identify the numbers
              of stars in each relevant evolutionary phase and derive metallicities for stars
              cool enough to be unaffected by diffusion, in several fields at varying
              distances from the Galactic center.
