The cosmological baryon density

David R. Tytler

Dr. Tytler
              is conducting a two part project.  The first part concerns the measurement of
              the ratio of the relative number of deuterium and hydrogen atoms, D/H, in the
              early universe.  D/H provides the best measurement of the average density of
              ordinary matter (baryons) in the universe.  In standard cosmology, D/H gives
              the best measure of the ratio between baryon density and photon density, which
              is a fundamental cosmological constant.  D/H provides one of the more direct
              tests of the big bang nucleosynthesis.  Dr. Tytler is measuring D/H from
              ultraviolet absorption lines that arise in low density ionized gas along the
              lines of sight to distant quasar stellar objects. 

The second part uses
              these same data to measure the cosmological distribution of metals.  This part
              addresses the question if there was an early generation of widely distributed
              pregalactic stars.  Dr. Tytler is measuring the  distribution of Oxygen to
              Hydrogen (O/H) in the intergalactic medium and comparing it with recent theory
              predictions.  Dr. Tytler is also using these data to estimate the metal
              abundance in hot collisionally  ionized gas.
