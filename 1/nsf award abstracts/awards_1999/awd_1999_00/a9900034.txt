This proposal is aimed at exploring the synthesis, chemistry
              and photophysics of a new class of silicate phosphor materials. The phosphors
              are unique in that no activator metals are needed to obtain efficient
              photoluminescence. Such materials may provide an alternative to existing
              phosphors that contain toxic heavy metal ions and as such pose a significant
              environmental hazard. The luminescent silicates that will be studied fall into
              two distinct classes depending on the alkoxysilane used in the synthesis. The
              first class are 'carboxysilicate' glasses that are stable at high temperatures.
              The second class are water-soluble 'aminosilicone' polymers that can be
              processed into a variety of shapes such as blocks, foams, and fibers. Both
              classes have high luminescence efficiency. These materials represent a new
              direction in silicon sol-gel chemistry and the aim of this proposal is to
              determine the structure, chemistry, and photophysics of the chromophore in
              these materials.
%%%
The discovery of efficient, environmentally benign
              phosphors for lighting, display, and specialty applications and the development
              of methods to synthesize polymeric silicones with interesting optical or
              electronic properties are of significant industrial interest as potential
              technologies.
