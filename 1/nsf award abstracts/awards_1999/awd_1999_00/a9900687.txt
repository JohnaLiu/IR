Title: Local,
              Regional and Remote Effects of Northern Hemisphere Snow Cover on Western U.S.
              Climate and Water Resources: A Multiscale Investigation

The primary goal of
              this collaborative investigation is to identify, characterize, and quantify the
              local, regional and remote effects of snow cover on the western US climate and
              water resources. The present proposal considers snow not as a passive responder
              but as an active driver of climate variability on multiple scales.  The effects
              of snow cover within the western US and the climate signals due to remote snow
              forcing will be considered. Empirical analyses and a suite of model experiments
              will be conducted. The work is important because it will lead to enhanced
              understanding of the role of snow cover in climate variability on a range of
              spatial and temporal scales.
