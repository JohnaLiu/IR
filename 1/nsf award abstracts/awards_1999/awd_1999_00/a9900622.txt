Abstract    :
              
This award is for the support of a wide-angle imaging survey of the Southern
              sky at 656.3 nm wavelength, the wavelength of the H-Alpha emission line of
              hydrogen.  This project was begun in 1997 and this award provides support to
              complete the project.  Each image of the survey covers an area of the sky 12.6
              minutes of angle in diameter at an angular resolution of about one arcminute,
              and reaches a sensitivity level of one Rayleigh (6 x 10- 18 erg CM-2 s- I
              arcsec-2).  This corresponds to an emission measure of 2 cm-6 pc, and to a
              brightness temperature for microwave free-free emission of 6 microKelvin at 30
              GHz. The survey uses a CCD detector, a commercial camera lens, and narrow-band
              interference filters.  This instrumentation is mounted on a robotic telescope
              platform located at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. As of
              October 1998, the survey was about 60% complete, and it is expected to finish
              the survey in 1999.  The survey will provide accurate measurement of
              anisotropies in the Galactic free-free emission at microwave wavelengths (or
              proof that these are negligible).  This observed emission must be subtracted
              from satellite or ground-based measurements to obtain the true cosmic microwave
              background fluctuations.   The analysis of the data from the survey will
              produce detailed information on the structure of the diffuse, warm, ionized
              component of the interstellar medium.  This information is necessary for
              understanding the dynamics of the interstellar gas. The images will be made
              available to the astronomical community as an H-Alpha Atlas of the Southern
              Sky, which will be distributed on CD-ROM disks and made available on the World
              Wide Web.  Participation by several undergraduate students in the project will
              enhance their understanding of the nature of scientific research.
