The Primordial Universe

Joseph Silk

Six US participants are
              attending the 1999 Summer School in Theoretical Physics at Les Houches, France.
               The topic is "The Primordial Universe".  One goal of this school is to bring
              together elementary particle physics and astrophysics.  The science goals of
              elementary particle physics and of astrophysics have considerable overlap,
              especially with regard to the very early universe and the search for dark
              matter. The school will consider supersymmetry, large scale structure,
              superstrings (quantum and cosmology), inflation, fluctuations, baryogensesis,
              and dark matter.
