Abstract    :
                   A thermal analysis instrument for research on materials processing is to be
              acquired for studies on the fabrication of powder structures into net-shaped
              components.  The device is designed for the observation of volatile
              processing-aid burnout during heating to the sintering temperature.  It will be
              applied to injection molded and die compacted structures, where lubricants,
              contaminants, moisture, or other volatile species are present on the powder
              surface.  Proper thermal cycle design requires knowledge on the type, amount,
              and temperature where the volatile species exit the compact, allowing thermal
              cycle definition in both research and production equipment.  The
              instrumentation will allow examination of actual components in realistic
              processing atmospheres, with simultaneous analysis of the heat flow, chemical
              reactions, and decomposition species.  It will be most useful in the design of
              efficient cycles and effective polymers for powder processing, with improved
              properties and dimensional tolerances in sintered devices.
     This equipment
              award will provide researchers in materials processing and characterization the
              opportunity to determine optimized conditions for the manufacturing of sintered
              products.
