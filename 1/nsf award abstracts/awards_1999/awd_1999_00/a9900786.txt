Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative project between the Institute of Applied Physics in
              Nizhny Novgorod, Russia and the University of Florida.   The researchers will
              develop new experimental techniques and apparatus to test LIGO (Laser
              Interferometer Gravity-wave Observatory) optical components.  It is well known
              that detection of gravitational waves imposes extremely high requirements on
              the quality of optical components in the interferometer.  Therefore commonly
              used techniques for characterizing optical surfaces and bulk properties are
              inadequate for LIGO.  The required steps in the test procedure include
              pre-installation and in-situ measurements of optical components, diagnosis of
              aging and contamination effects and monitoring of optical component performance
              under high-power CW radiation loading.  The technical and scientific expertise
              of the Institute of Applied Physics and University of Florida personnel will
              make possible significant contributions to the success of the LIGO project.
