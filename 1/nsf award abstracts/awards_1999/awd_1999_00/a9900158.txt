Description: This award is to support a US-Tunisia Workshop
              on Dune Formation and Migration to be held in Medenine, Tunisia, April 18-25,
              1999.  The US Principal Investigator is James T. Jenkins, Department of
              Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, Cornell University.  The Tunisian organizer
              is Houcine Khatelli, Directeur General of the Institut des Regions Arrides in
              Medenine, Tunisia.  North African and US researchers will join with European
              colleagues in this workshop devoted to the aeloian transport of sand and the
              formation and migration of sand dunes.  Physicists, engineers, and geologists
              will discuss the application of recent advances in their respective fields to
              this important problem.  A significant part of the workshop will be devoted to
              field studies.  A goal of the workshop is to develop a network of US, European,
              and North African scientists committed to an understanding of desert
              processes.

Scope:  This project focuses on a problem of great importance to
              North African countries, namely the encroachment of the desert on cultivated or
              otherwise developed land.  The workshop will take place in Medenine in southern
              Tunisia at the Institute des Regions Arrides, where 200 people are working on
              the problem of desertification.  This proposal meets the INT objective of
              supporting international workshops that are likely to increase collaboration in
              areas of mutual interest.  This project is co-funded by INT and the Division of
              Chemical and Transport Systems.
