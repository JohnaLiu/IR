Hawkins-Breaux

Drexel University, is a representative of the
              Greater Philadelphia Region Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation
              (Philadelphia LSAMP), seeks continued funding as an AMP Phase II project, to
              intensify its on-going efforts to substantially increase the quantity and
              quality of African American, Hispanic and Native Americans students receiving
              baccalaureate degrees in science, mathematics, engineering and technology
              (SMET), and subsequently, entering graduate school to attain doctoral degrees. 
              Philadelphia AMP represents a diverse alliance of public and private, 2- and
              4-year, research and non-research, Historically Black Colleges and Universities
              (HBCUs) and majority institutions.  A salient feature of this proposal is the
              fundamental manner in which the proposed AMP Phase II project rests on a solid
              foundation of collaboration, cooperation and concerted efforts focused on
              minority student achievement under the current Philadelphia AMP.
