Abstract    :
              	Ray splitting occurs in all wave systems in which the properties of the
              propagation medium change on a scale smaller than a wave length.  Although one
              of the most basic concepts of physics, ray splitting has profound consequences
              for the spectra of wave systems that contain ray-splitting boundaries.  One of
              these consequences is the existence of a new non-deterministic, non-Newtonian
              mechanics that forms the semiclassical backbone of ray-splitting
              systems.
	This work will investigate the effects of ray splitting in quantum
              mechanical systems.  The key points are: (i) the analytical computation of
              ray-splitting corrections to the Weyl formulae of quantum ray-splitting systems
              in two and three dimensions, (ii) the investigation of lateral-ray orbits,
              (iii) the search for non-Newtonian ghost orbits, (iv) the study of
              time-reversal violation and (v) the investigation of experimental
              implementations of quantum ray-splitting systems.
