A systematic computational exploration of the behavior and
              properties of nanoscopic particles that could function as nanomachine parts is
              proposed. The study comprises three phases: (1) the mechanically controlled
              movement of nanoparticles over substrates; (2) the "lubrication" of
              nanoparticles by simple fluids; (3) chemical reactions mechanically induced by
              the movement of nanoparticles over one another. The principal tool is atomistic
              computer simulation based on Monte Carlo techniques.

As technology for the
              construction of mechanical elements advances toward the nanoscale, the drive to
              build machines with controllable moving parts of nanoscopic dimension mounts.
              The operation of such machines is expected to be very different from their
              macroscopic coun-terparts. The goal of this research is to understand the
              fundamental basis for the behavior of nanomachine parts under the conditions
              likely to be necessary for their fabrication and for the effective functioning
              of the machines that they would make up.
