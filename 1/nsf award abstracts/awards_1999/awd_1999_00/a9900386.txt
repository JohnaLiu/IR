This award supports the establishment of a Summer
              Research Institute in Australia commencing in 1999 and running in alternate
              years through 2003.  This project grew out of a successful pilot project
              supported by the NSF East Asia and Pacific Program in 1998 through which twelve
              undergraduates and two graduate students from the University of New Mexico
              (UNM) spent a month in Australia engaged in research related to tropical
              ecology.  The program will provide a diverse group of students a unique
              opportunity to acquire extensive knowledge of a flora and fauna of Godwanan
              ancestry while learning the fundamentals of field research and project design. 
              The educational and research experience in Australia will last for just over
              four weeks in each alternate summer and is organized in conjunction with the
              University of New Mexico's General Honors Division with support from UNM's
              Department of Biology and a variety of Australian host groups, including the
              Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, and the
              Australian Museum's Research Station at Lizard Island.  The students will work
              in direct association with scientific researchers and conservation
              organizations in Australia, as well as faculty from UNM.  They will conduct
              small, short-term research projects in ecology and biodiversity studies while
              traveling through several biomes of tropical and subtropical Australia.  By the
              end of the program, each student will be prepared to work in a more independent
              setting, will have acquired the basic skills of a field biologist, and will
              have carried a research project all the way from design to both a written and
              oral presentation.
