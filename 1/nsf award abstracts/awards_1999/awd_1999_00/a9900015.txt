Abstract    :
              High strength concrete (HSC) is increasingly being used in numerous types of
              structural systems, however its performance when subjected to fire poses unique
              concerns. In particular, the very low permeability of HSC can make it
              especially prone to spalling that is induced by moisture migration. This
              research will focus on experimentally measuring internal pore pressures in
              heated HSC elements, on experimentally measuring key material parameters that
              affect the movement of moisture through heated HSC, and on developing
              appropriate numeric simulation models. Steady state flow tests will include
              measurement of  intrinsic permeability, relative permeability, and slip flow
              parameters. Transient heating tests will measure internal pore pressures and
              strains developed in heated partially saturated HSC elements. Temperature
              dependency of flow parameters will be examined experimentally. Results obtained
              from experimental testing will be incorporated into a numeric simulation model
              so that potential damage mitigation methods can be explored.
