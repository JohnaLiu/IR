Near infrared surveys for high redshift quasars

Donald P.
              Schneider

Over the last decade the NSF has funded a series of surveys,
              carried out using a large format CCD camera on the Palomar 5-m telescope. 
              These surveys have investigated quasar populations at a redshift of about four.
               The highest redshift quasars are interesting; they place the strongest
              constraints on formation mechanisms of these objects and reveal the nature of
              the intergalactic medium at ever earlier times.  In this study, Dr. Schneider
              is extending these studies out to redshifts of up to six.  The investigations
              consist of the following datasets: (1) two Palomar CCD surveys; a four filter
              survey and a slitless survey.  (2)the Sloan Digital Sky Survey; and (3) optical
              identifications in two deep x-ray surveys form Roentgen Satellite and the
              Chandra advanced x-ray facility.
