Abstract    :
              The liquid-fluidized bed classification (LFBC) approach will be investigated
              using a laboratory facility and numerical simulation.  LFBC can be employed for
              simultaneous separation of a number of plastic particle species of various
              sizes, densities and shapes.  The solid particles may be either lighter or
              heavier than the liquid.  Flow visualizations, measurements of dispersion
              coefficients and separation performance will be performed in a vertical column.
               Step temperature variation of the carrier liquid will be tested in order to
              improve particle segregation.  A predictive numerical model of system
              performance will be developed.  The research results will form the basis for
              design of liquid fluidized systems for sorting and recycling processes. If
              successful, these processes will offer a low-cost, environmental benign
              technology for waste minimization.
