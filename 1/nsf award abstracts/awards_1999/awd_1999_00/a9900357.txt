This work aims at a fundamental understanding of combustion
              synthesis especially in the volume combustion synthesis (VCS) mode.  A
              knowledge of reaction mechanisms and chemical kinetics of VCS that incorporates
              phase changes and microstructure evolution is necessary to control product
              structure and properties.  To achieve this, a set of new experimental methods
              is used.  The kinetics of high-temperature (up to 3000o K) heterogeneous
              reactions at heating rates up to 106 oK/sec is studied by computer-assisted
              electrothermo- graphy (CAE).  To overcome difficulties in determining laws from
              the time dependence of the reaction rate, time-resolved X-ray diffraction
              (TRXRD) is used; this provides continuous measurement of the kinetics of phase
              formation under reaction conditions.  Temperature distribution across the
              sample during all stages of VCS is monitored by a set of thermocouples and by a
              high-speed infrared imaging system.  Direct observation of microstructural
              transformation is done with a modified digital high-speed microscopic video
              recorder with rates up to 12,000 frames/sec.  The first stage of the research
              will look at formation of nitrides and binary intermetallics of nickel,
              aluminum, titanium, and niobium.  In the second stage, more complex systems
              will be examined including direct formation of ceramic-metal composites.
