Abstract    :
              
This project is being funded as part of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Research in
              Urban Earthquake Disaster Mitigation activity.  Using a comprehensive database
              related to earthquake injuries, the project will integrate actual casualty data
              and associated medical costs with post-event damage appraisals to enhance and
              refine loss estimation models for emergency response and mitigation.  The
              principal source of data will be related to the 1994 Northridge earthquake. 
              Data from the 1995 Kobe earthquake and other earthquakes will be used to
              further define and test new projections.  Specific project aims are to: create
              standardized definitions and procedural protocols to describe structural damage
              and injury in earthquake loss estimation; thoroughly document injuries,
              associated costs, structural types and related damage stemming from the 
              Northridge earthquake; use standard definitions and data to refine models
              predicting injury incidence and loss estimation; and transfer new knowledge to
              professionals involved in earthquake hazard response and mitigation. 
              Collaboration with Japanese researchers will include the collection of data
              from the Kobe earthquake and the exchange of reports and documents related to
              earthquake casualties.
