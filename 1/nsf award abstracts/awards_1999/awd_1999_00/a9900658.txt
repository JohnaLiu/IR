Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on a
              computational study of the mechanism of quark confinement in quantum
              chromodynamics.  It is well-established that the familiar nuclear particles,
              neutrons and protons, are composed of quarks.  But these quarks are for some
              reason confined within the nuclear particles, and are never seen as free
              objects. Quantum chromodynamics is the theory which describes quarks and their
              interactions.  Understanding how quantum chromodynamics accomplishes quark
              confinement is one of the most important unsolved problems in theoretical
              physics.
