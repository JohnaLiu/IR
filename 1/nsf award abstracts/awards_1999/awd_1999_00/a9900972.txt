Abstract    :
              Reform of undergraduate education is a major priority for the Education and
              Human Resources Directorate, with a national awareness activity based on
              "Shaping the Future" that has been carried out over the past two years and a
              major initiative on institution-wide reform.  However, there is, as yet, little
              information available to the field regarding the effects of undergraduate
              reform.  This study will explore in depth the process and impact of reform
              through case studies in 1-4 institutions that have institution-wide reform
              awards and will complement current efforts to document this important national
              innovation.
