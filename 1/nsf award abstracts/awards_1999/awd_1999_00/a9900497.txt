Abstract    :
              The focus of the project is to sequence the genome of the Archaea Halobacterium
              sp. NRC-1, which contains a stable 2.0 Mbp circular chromosome and two large
              unstable plasmids, pNRC 100 and pNRC200, 191 and 300 kb, respectively.  The
              NRC-1 chromosome and plasmid pNRC200 have been mapped at low resolution and two
               BAC (bacterial artificial chromosomal) libraries, each with over 15-fold
              representation, have been constructed.  The plasmid pNRC100 has been sequenced
              in its entirety.  The BAC-end sequence strategy developed for more complex
              genomes will be used to complete the NRC-1 genome sequencing.  This will
              circumvent sequence assembly problems resulting from the presence of a large
              number of repeated sequences in the Halobacterium genome.  The complete genome
              sequence will be analyzed using sequence-analysis programs from NCBI, the
              University of Washington and Genetics Computer Group software packages.  Genes
              with homologues in other organisms will be analyzed by multiple sequence
              alignments and phylogenetic analysis, as well as through primary literature
              searches.  Genomic analysis will focus on the relationship of halophiles to
              other Archaea, as well as to eubacteria and eukaryotes, the mechanism of
              adaptation to high salinity, and the acquisition of new metabolic capabilities
              such as aerobic respiration, by an Archaeon.  This research has the potential
              to have a significant impact in the area of biotechnology, stress biology -
              specifically in the area of salt tolerance, and systematic biology.
