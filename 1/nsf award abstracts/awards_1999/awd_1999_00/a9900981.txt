Abstract    :
              This project will develop a 3-dimensional simulation of the Earth's ring
              current.  There are many unanswered questions about the storm time ring
              current.  What role does the induced electric field play in the energization of
              electrons and ions in the ring current?  What role does the induced electric
              field play in the decay of the ring current?  What is the relative importance
              of solar wind vs. ionospheric ions in the formation of the ring current? Do
              induced electric fields play a role in the production of relativistic "killer"
              electrons in the radiation belts?  In order to answer these questions, the ring
              current model which was developed under a previous GEM grant will be improved
              by incorporating more realistic electric and magnetic field models, using more
              realistic source particle distributions, and developing algorithms to perform
              phase space mapping simulations.  This improved simulation will then be applied
              to specific magnetic storm events where the results can be compared with data
              from the CRRES satellite
