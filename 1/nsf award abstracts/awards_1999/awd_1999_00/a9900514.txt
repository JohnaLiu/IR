Abstract    :
              
This grant is to support the participation of students in the Twentieth Fungal
              Genetics Conference at the Asilomar Conference Center in Asilomar, California
              on March 23-28, 1999.  The students will participate with approximately 600
              scientists and students from around the world.  The conference focuses on the
              molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology of filamentous
              fungi.  The meeting will consist of four plenary sessions, four sessions
              devoted to concurrent workshops in specialized areas, three poster sessions,
              and informal discussions.  Topics to be covered in plenary sessions are:
              regulation of gene expression including global regulation and epigenetic
              phenomena, sexual and asexual differentiation, secondary metabolism, and
              pathogenicity, and cell biology emphasizing organelle biogenesis and transport.
               In the meeting, strong emphasis is placed on the participation of young
              scientists and students, particularly those from underrepresented groups.
