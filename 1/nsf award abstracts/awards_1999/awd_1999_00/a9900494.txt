Abstract    :
              	Biomass burning is a useful land-management tool, a key component of important
              agricultural systems, and a source of renewable energy.  Biomass burning is
              also a significant source of atmospheric trace gases and particles. 
              Uncertainty in the initial characteristics and transformations of these
              emissions is a major limiting factor in models of atmospheric chemistry,
              radiative transfer, and global climate change.  In this project, an airborne
              Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer will be used to measure a wide
              variety of stable and reactive emissions in biomass burning smoke. 
              Measurements will include:  carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane,
              formaldehyde, 2-hydroxyethanal, methanol, phenol, acetic acid, formic acid,
              sulfur dioxide, carbonyl sulfide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitrous
              oxide, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, ethene, ethane, ethyne, propene, isobutene,
              monoterpenes, ozone, water, and particle ammonium nitrate.  These measurements
              will be made during the year 2000 burning season as part of the Southern Africa
              Fire Research Initiative (SAFARI-2000), an African-European-US collaborative
              effort.  This study will determine the concentration of oxygenated organic
              molecules in the initial emissions from tropical fires, and examine how such
              emissions impact the photochemistry of smoke plumes.  The project will also
              involve an intercomparison of the FTIR with a number of other gas measurement
              techniques using laboratory fires.
