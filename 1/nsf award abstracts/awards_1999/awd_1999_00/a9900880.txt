Abstract    :
              The researchers propose to study the context within which increases in measures
              of student performance occur in order to develop a predictive reformative
              schemata.  The criterion variable is increased student performance, as measured
              by achievement tests.  The predictive variables are both qualitative and
              quantitative:

  --Responsive management:  (measuring openness to innovation
              and the internalization of programs, barriers to progress, use of external
              partners, replication of practices and sustainability)
  --Mobius
              communication loops:  (measuring data needs, access to practical research
              findings and information about achievement results and the use of student
              achievement data, and effective means of sharing information, for example a
              website-an emergent product of the study)
  --Efficiency of staff development
              and subprogram funding:  (measuring teacher training in terms of appropriate
              format, levels, content and duration and linkages to other instructional
              programs)

Additionally, the study team has emphasized that the close
              investigation of the third variable-systemic efficiency of staff development
              and instructional programs-would provide invaluable information for urban
              educational systems in other states.
