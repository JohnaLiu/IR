Abstract    :
              



The proposed research is to explore efficient second harmonic generation
              under the conditions where the generated second harmonic pulses walk off in
              time from the input short pulse due to the difference in the group velocities
              of these pulses.  Attention will be focused on the large walkoff regime. 
              Effects of focusing and pump depletion will be investigated to optimize the
              nonlinear conversion efficiency.  The proposed research will elucidate the
              novel phenomenology associated with this relatively unexplored large temporal
              walkoff regime and expand the fundamental knowledge about second harmonic
              generation and its applications for portable and efficient blue and ultraviolet
              sources.
