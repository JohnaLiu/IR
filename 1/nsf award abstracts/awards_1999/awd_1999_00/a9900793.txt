Abstract    :
              A program of advanced detector research and development for LIGO is proposed by
              a multidisciplinary group at Stanford University.  The group proposes research
              in the areas of interferometer configurations, high power lasers and optics,
              vibration isolation, alignment and interferometer control and advanced
              materials development for suspensions and core optics.  All of these areas of
              research are important for the upgrade of LIGO that will provide sufficient
              sensitivity and bandwidth to fully exploit the potential of the LIGO detectors
              as a gravity wave astronomical observatory.  The Stanford group comprises
              faculty and research scientists in the departments of Applied Physics, 
              Aeronautics and Astronautics,  Electrical Engineering and Physics.  They
              include well known experts in laser development, electronics, materials
              science, optics, optoelectronics and  semiconductors.  This wideranging
              research program is viewed by the gravity wave community to be critically
              important for the success of LIGO.
