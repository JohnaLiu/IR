Abstract    :
              Organizational theorists have become increasingly interested in the study of
              organizational networks and how they differ from markets and hierarchies.
              However, the majority of the research has focused on long-term, open-ended
              relationships and neglected the more elusive, but equally prevalent short-term
              relationships (e.g., single project collaborations). This doctoral dissertation
              project analyzes one specific type of flexible organizational network called a
              Short-Term Network Organization (STNO). An STNO is defined as an intentionally
              created organizational entity which combines independent contributors for the
              objective of accomplishing a single short-term task. While flexibility
              advantages and entrepreneurial opportunities of network organizations have been
              the focus of attention in the academic and practitioner literature, this work
              focuses on the substantial coordination challenges STNOs present. Combining
              transaction cost economics and institutional theory, we hypothesize that STNOs
              will: (1) strengthen psychological contracts, (2) support collective
              sanctioning systems, and (3) rely on industry-wide standardized STNO
              coordination practices to reduce transaction costs and to improve STNO
              performance. Hypotheses will be tested on a stratified random sample of 400
              movie projects from 1930-1950. The dissertation contributes to organizational
              theory by conceptualizing STNOs and the governance challenges they imply. It
              introduces and tests three strategies organizations in the movie industry may
              have found to address these challenges. If successful, the results will provide
              practitioners with needed guidance for the implementation of a
              little-understood organizational form.
