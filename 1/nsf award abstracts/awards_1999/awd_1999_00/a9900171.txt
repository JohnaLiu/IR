Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for developing a new technology for seamless
              integration of geometric design and engineering analysis tools using a new
              hybrid computer representation.  The new representation combines an implicit
              function representation of the geometric model with a piecewise continuous
              model of the analysis problem.   Such representations can be constructed
              automatically and support meshfree analyses of spatially distributed problems,
              where the spatial discretization no longer needs to conform to the geometric
              domain or boundary conditions.  Specific goals of this project include:  (1)
              development of a modeling theory based on the new hybrid representation, with
              focus on computational and numerical properties; (2) design and implementation
              of a framework and software environment integrating geometric design and
              analysis, based on the new hybrid representation; (3) formulation, experimental
              studies, and comparison of computed meshfree solutions with other known
              solutions and/or experimental results; and (4) investigating application of the
              new technology to problems that are difficult to solve with traditional
              methods, in particular to shape optimization and simulation problems with
              time-varying geometries.

If successful, this research has the potential to
              realize major gains in the product development cycle by integrating geometric
              design and analysis across models, disciplines, and levels of abstraction. 
              Elimination of the difficult and time-consuming meshing procedures should allow
              major advances in automating solutions to the problems that today require
              lengthy manual constructions, tedious analysis, and special-purpose tools.
