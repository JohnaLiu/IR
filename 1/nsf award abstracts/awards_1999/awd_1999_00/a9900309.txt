Abstract    :
              9900309  Edmund Clark
Model checking is an automatic verification technique for
              finite state concurrent systems such as sequential circuit designs and
              communication protocols.  By using special data structures like binary decision
              diagrams, it is possible to verify properties of extremely complex systems with
              immense numbers of reachable states. Although the technique is already in use
              by major high-tech firms, additional research is needed to realize the full
              potential of the method.  There is a limit on the size of problems that can be
              handled by current tools.  One of the goals of this research is to pursue a
              number of projects that will attack the state explosion problem and allow
              larger systems to be verified, some many orders of magnitude larger than
              currently possible.  Another goal is to extend model checking techniques to
              different types of systems that cannot be directly handled today. 
              Traditionally, model checking has been applied to hardware designs, being later
              extended to other types of systems such as real-time systems.  We believe that
              applying model checking to different types of systems such as stochastic
              systems can open up new areas of research and help solve important problems
              with practical applications.  The work will be done in collaboration with
              Sergio Campos of the Federal University of Minas Gerais and David Deharbe of
              the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, who will be supported by CNPq of
              Brazil.
