In Langlands' program, one stubborn problem has emerged
              which, so far, has
defied all attempts at a general proof:  the conjecture of
              Langlands
and Shelstad which is generally known as "the fundamental lemma". 
              In its
original formulation, the fundamental lemma is an equality
              between
orbital integrals on two different algebraic groups.  In this
              project,
the fundamental lemma is translated into a statement relating the
              cohomology
of two different pro-algebraic varieties.  Techniques are then
              developed
for computing these cohomology groups in such a way that they may
              be
compared with each other.  This procedure should result in a proof of
the
              fundamental lemma in the "unramified case", and may well eventually
lead to a
              proof in the general case.


During the last twenty years, mathematicians
              have directed tremendous
efforts towards proving a collection of conjectures,
              due to R. Langlands,
which unify several apparently very different fields: 
              number theory,
group representation theory, and automorphic forms.  Each of
              these fields
would then benefit from being able to import techniques,
              problems, and 
results from the other fields.  Progress on 
these conjectures
              (which were at one time considered almost hopeless)
has been spectacular: 
              many of them are completely solved or
verified and all of them have been
              checked in many special cases.  Even
these partial results are extremely
              important:  for example, A. Wiles'
recent and celebrated proof of the Fermat
              conjecture makes
essential use of some of these results from "Langlands'
              program."
Researchers are now optimistic that this program may be
              successfully
completed during the next decade.
