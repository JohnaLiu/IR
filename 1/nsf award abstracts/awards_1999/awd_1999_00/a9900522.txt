The International Biophysics Congress meets once
              every three years.  The
13th congress is to be held in New Deli from September
              19-24, with the
Biophysical Society of USA participating.  The need for
              scientific
interaction at the international level is clear and this meeting
              provides a
proper forum for the exchange of information and ideas in the
              general area
of Biophysics. The presence of US scientists, especially those of
              the
emerging generation is encouraged. The support from NSF will
              emphasize
support for young US investigators.
