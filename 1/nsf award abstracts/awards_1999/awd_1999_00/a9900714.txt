The anomalous dependence of coarsening behavior on gamma
              prime precipitate volume fraction and the evolution of the morphology of the
              precipitates are investigated in selected binary nickel alloys (Ni-Al, Ni-Ga,
              Ni-Ge, Ni-Si, and Ni-Ti).  The rationale for selecting these alloys is that the
              lattice mismatch varies from a low of - 0.00226 in the Ni-Si alloys to a high
              of 0.01005 in the Ni-Ga alloys. The magnitude of lattice mismatch plays an
              important role in the precipitate morphology and the tendency of the
              precipitates to align.  The equilibrium gamma prime volume fractions can be
              varied by an order of magnitude in these alloys.  The research has two
              principal thrusts: (1) investigation of coarsening kinetics over a wide range
              of precipitate volume fraction; and (2) quantitative characterization of the
              morphologies of gamma prime precipitates as functions of particle size, lattice
              mismatch, and volume fraction.  Experimental characterization methods include
              dark-field transmission electron microscopy, image analyzing software applied
              to scanned TEM negatives, and magnetic analysis to measure the variation of
              solute concentration.  The relationship between anomalous coarsening and
              lattice mismatch is examined in the selected alloys.

Prior research on
              nickel-aluminum alloys has shown that when the volume fraction of gamma prime
              precipitate is below 0.05, the interfaces of individual large precipitates
              become concave.  This research characterizes the evolution of gamma prime
              precipitate shape to determine whether the concave cuboidal shape is a
              thermodynamic equilibrium shape.  This is important for scientific
              understanding because recent theoretical analyses suggest that concave cuboidal
              shapes are metastable.
