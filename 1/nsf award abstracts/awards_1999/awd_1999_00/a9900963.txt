The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide support for an eight-month
              postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Laura J. Niedernhofer to work with Dr. Jan
              H. J. Hoejimakers at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.
Dr.
              Niedernhofer's research hypothesis is that the protein ERCC1 plays a critical
              role in repairing DNA interstrand cross-links by a mechanism that is
              independent of nucleotide excision repair and that the accumulation of DNA
              interstrand cross-links in the tissues of ERCC1 knock-out mice contributes to
              their premature senescence (aging).  The ultimate goal of this project is to
              prove a causal role for the interstrand cross-links in the senscence phenotype
              of these mice.
Dr. Hoejimakers' lab is one of the best in the world in the
              area of DNA repair, having cloned several key XP genes and developed important
              mouse knock-out models.
