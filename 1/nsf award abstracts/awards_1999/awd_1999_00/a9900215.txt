This is a planning visit proposed by Dr. Chien-Liang Liu,
              Washington State University,  to work with Dr. Ruen-Rone Lee of the Taiwan
              Industrial Technology Research Institute to design a virtual-reality-on-demand
              system.  The proposed system will provide concurrent accesses to the virtual
              environment.  The results will benefit many types of computer applications such
              as simulation, training and scientific visualization.  This study is jointly
              sponsored by the Taiwan National Science Council and the National Science
              Foundation.
