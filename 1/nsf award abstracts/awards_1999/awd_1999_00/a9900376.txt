This three-year US-France cooperative research
              award in operations research and production systems involves Monique
              Guignard-Spielberg and Peter Hahn of the University of Pennsylvania and
              Catherine Roucairol of the French National Institute for Research in Computer
              Science and Applied Mathematics (INRIA) at Rocquencourt and the University of
              Versailles.  The researchers propose to study the impact of parallel processing
              on the quadratic assignment problem.  This, the most difficult combinatorial
              optimization problem, involves more than 625 variables.  Its study is important
              for improving computational techniques used in modeling, design and
              optimization of man-made systems.

The US investigators bring to this
              collaboration expertise in quadratic assignment problems.  This is complemented
              by the French group's expertise in parallelization of branch and bound
              algorithms.  The research will contribute to understanding of the inherent
              difficulties in quadratic assignment problems, their solutions, as well as
              parallel solutions of difficult combinatorial optimization problems.
