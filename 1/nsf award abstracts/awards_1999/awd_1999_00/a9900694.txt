Abstract    :
              Dissolved oxygen is frequently the limiting factor for cell growth in aerobic
              fermentations, particularly when foaming (surfactant-like bioproducts) and/or
              shear sensitive cells prevent taking remedial action.  Microorganisms can
              accept oxygen from other oxidizing agents, e.g., nitrate ion, and the process
              in termed anaerobic respiration.  The goal of this modest SGER proposal is to
              demonstrate that nitrate-assisted respiration will facilitate the fermentation
              of glucose to commercially useful rhamnolipid surfactants by supplementing the
              normal oxygen respiration process.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa which utilizes
              nitrate as an oxygen source, converts it to the benign N2 which should not
              inhibit the fermentation.  The hypothesis is that the "denitrification" process
              can be shown to be a useful aide to a broad range of industrial fermentations
              if the process is properly controlled.  New. limiting nutrients will be
              determined under the anaerobic respiration conditions and changes in the
              microbial metabolism, including the key product, will be studied.
