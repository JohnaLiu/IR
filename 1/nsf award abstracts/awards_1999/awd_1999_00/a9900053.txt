Abstract    :
              This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research
              project will investigate the use of highly concentrated solar energy as a means
              of supplying a large amount of process heat at very high temperatures.  The
              production of metals by carbothermal reduction of their oxides involves a
              high-temperature, energy-intensive process.  The temperature required, in the
              range of 2100 - 2300 deg C, is at the upper limit for practical process heat
              addition from a combustion source alone. It is expected that when used for
              aluminum production a solar process would reduce the CO2 emissions from the
              aluminum industry, and the gas product would be CO rather than CO2. 

The
              expertise provided by the principle investigator and the Alcoa collaboration
              will be directed towards developing a creative and potentially revolutionary
              reactor and process concept that could have significant implications for the
              manufacture of the more exotic, difficult to extract materials, as well as
              aluminum. Experimental work will be conducted at the Institute for Materials
              and Processes solar test facility in Odeillo, France.
