Abstract    :
              This project explores molecular structure-property relationships of electron
              transfer rates in dendritic structures.  These structures encompass a
              redox-active core around which is arrayed a dendritic structure.  Rationally
              designed modifications of this structure will make possible the use of new
              techniques for characterizing electron transfer.  Such variations as a
              hydrophilic and metallaphilic surfaces will be explored to this end.  In
              addition, changes in the structure of the dendritic core as a function of
              internal steric forces will be investigated and its effect on electron transfer
              elucidated.  Modulation of electron transfer in these systems has relevance to
              the areas of molecular electronic devices and metallaproteins.

With this
              Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research
              of Professor Christopher B. Gorman of North Carolina State University. 
              Professor Gorman explores the properties of man-made substances that
              incorporate an electrically active core surrounded by a shell of varying
              composition and thickness, finally covered by a skin having specific properties
              such as electrical conductivity or water solubility.  The electronic properties
              of such structures is of interest and has potential applications in the area of
              electronics as well as being analogous to biological structures called enzymes.
