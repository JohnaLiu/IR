Summary:

Constraint programming incorporates efficient
              techniques for
solving problems that involve a large amount of search.
              Even
after incorporating these efficient constraint-solving
techniques, the
              search space can still be very large.
This project proposes to perform
              research on design and
implementation of constraint programming systems on
              shared memory
multiprocessors (SMPs) so that these
              compute-intensive
constraint programs can be executed much faster.
              Efficient
implementation techniques for realizing scalable
              constraint
programming systems on distributed memory multiprocessors
              (DMPs)
as well as on distributed clusters of SMPs will also be designed.
The
              project's eventual aim is to build a unified parallel system
that seamlessly
              runs on a distributed network of shared memory
multiprocessors.   The project
              will be pursued in formal cooperation
with the Federal University of Rio de
              Janeiro (UFRJ) and the Federal
University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in
              Brazil. The research
will make contributions to the area of constraint
              programming,
logic programming, parallel processing, and programming
              languages
through the new techniques developed for scalable
              implementation,
compilation, and optimizations.
