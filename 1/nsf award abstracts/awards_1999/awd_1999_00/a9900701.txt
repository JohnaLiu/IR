Abstract    :
              Multiprocessor interconnects have been designed primarily to provide
              high
throughput and low latency for best-effort traffic. This is true
              for
processing node architectures and communication software as well.
              However,
with the increasing use of these systems (clusters in particular)
              for
interactive applications such as multimedia, web servers and
              electronic
commerce, predictable communication performance, called Quality of
              service
(QoS), has become a major concern. Many of these applications
              require
guaranteed communication delay and bandwidth, in addition to low
              latency
and high throughput. The main focus of this research is to design
              an
end-to-end communication infrastructure for a cluster system to
              support
different applications with varying QoS requirements. The
              research
activities include (1) router architecture design and evaluation to
              provide
predictable and high performance; (2) network interface and
              software
messaging layer support to inject/eject traffic into/from the network
              as
per QoS requirements; and (3) CPU scheduling mechanisms that
              propagate
these capabilities up to the application level. The research
              proposes to
seamlessly integrate these three components to provide a high
              performance
communication architecture with QoS guarantees.
