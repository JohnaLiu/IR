Abstract    :
                   This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research
              project  focuses on specific behavior in solidifying metal that relates to the
              microstructure being formed and the mechanisms of the process. Thin strip
              casting of aluminum and steel can provide industry with an opportunity to
              produce netshape products via a process that has lower cost and lower
              environmental impact in terms of energy and material flow.  Single roller melt
              drag, twin roller, and two roller melt drag processes were investigated and
              modeled, with some understanding of controlling parameters being established.
              In practice it has been found that the quality of the cast strip can be poor,
              with several surface and microstructural defects occurring. This work will
              focus on the fundamental analysis of the effects of various operation
              parameters upon the solidification and cooling of the strip.  Experimental work
              and stress analysis performed by computational modeling of the solidifying thin
              strip metal will be conducted. 
     This GOALI project will include the
              participation of Reynolds Metals, Armco, Inc., and Transmet Corporation, with
              the use of production scale casters at these companies to validate the models
              developed in this project.  It is expected that the models will provide direct
              information on the appropriate processing parameters to generate improved
              thermal flow paths and induced thermal stresses.  It is also expected that this
              work, if successful, will help the U.S. primary metals industry remain
              competitive in the global economy.
