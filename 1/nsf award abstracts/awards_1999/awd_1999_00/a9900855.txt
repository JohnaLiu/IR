This project involves a complete study of the supramolecular
              assembly of nanometer scale objects at the air/water interface of a
              Langmuir-Blodgett trough. It is organized into six tasks: (I) Two-dimensional
              networks and (2) Molecular squares will be prepared at the air/water interface;
              (3) Preparing and characterizing the precursor metal complexes and addressing
              factors such as complex stability to hydrolysis and the kinetics of the
              condensation reactions; (4) Utilizing variables such as temperature, acidity,
              and reactant concentration, and presence of co-surfactants to tune the
              interfacial condensation reactions; (5) Characterization of film formation at
              the air/water interface using techniques to include Fourier Transform Infrared
              Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, and Atomic Force Microscopy;
              and (6) Addressing future directions such as films on solid supports, and
              tuning physical properties.

Many of the technological applications of
              nanometer scale objects, such as functional electronic nano-archetictures that
              include molecular-level probes, transducers, wires, contacts, insulators, and
              shielding, can be engineered using a "bottoms-up" approach involving chemical
              control of molecular assembly to achieve the synthesis of these functional
              nanostructures by chemical design. A deeper understanding of the fundamental
              science is needed to advance these capabiltites. Students trained in these
              areas will likely face an inviting job market due to emerging industrial
              priorities that are being driven by global competitiveness.
