Abstract    :
              The "Seventh International Meeting on Ciliate Molecular Biology" will be held as
              a FASEB conference at the Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, Vermont, August
              7-12, 1999. 

This meeting will bring together research scientists who are
              employing molecular techniques to investigate diverse biological problems using
              ciliated protozoa as a model system. Young scientists will have the opportunity
              to interact with experienced mature scientists in an atmosphere conducive to
              optimizing such discourse.
