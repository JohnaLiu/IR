This US-Argentina dissertation enhancement establishes a
              two year international research collaboration between Dr. Daniel Simberloff,
              University of Tennessee, and Dr. Marcelo Aizen, Universidad Nacional del
              Comahue, Rio Negro, Argentina,  to study the effects of disturbance by
              introduced herbivores on plant-animal mutualisms in the subantarctic forests of
              southern Argentina.  The U.S. investigator will have access to the extensive
              knowledge that the Argentine ecologists have of subantarctic forest systems,
              while the Argentinean researchers  will benefit from the US researchers
              experience in community ecology.  

This long term collaboration between two
              highly respected groups wil lead to a better understanding of herbivory X
              mutualism in a geographical region about which relatively little is known and,
              in the long run, provide improved conservation and management of land resources
              for geographic regions with similar characteristics.
