This three-year award supports US-UK collaborative research in
              knowledge and cognitive systems between George Luger of the University of New
              Mexico and Brendan McGonigle at the University of Edinburgh's Laboratory for
              Cognitive Neuroscience and Intelligent Systems.  Their research involves the
              development of probabilistic models of diagnostic reasoning and testing of new
              algorithms developed by the US investigator. Both groups are concerned with
              performance improvement of robots through error identification and failure
              recovery.  The investigators propose that iterative performance will improve by
              embedding abductive reasoning in the robot's environment.  

The US
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in schema-based abduction,
              a form of causal reasoning, which employs Bayesian Networks as the underlying
              representation.  This is complemented by the Edinburgh group's expertise in
              intelligent systems and takes advantage of learning experiments utilizing their
              NOMAD robot.  Collaboration with the Edinburgh group provides an opportunity to
              study the cognitive plausibility of the US investigator's proposed model of
              diagnostic reasoning.
