Recently theoretical physicists have devoted special
              attention to the protein folding problem. Using techniques that originated from
              modern statistical physics (spin glasses and disordered systems); they have
              been trying to explore this central problem in biology.
During the last
              meeting of the American Physical Society (APS) in March of 1998, several
              Divisions of the APS partially addressed the protein folding problem at the
              theoretical level. Discussions were very active and the interest in this
              problem was noticeable. This is a very positive advance for biophysics. The
              weakness of the meeting was the lack of a strong connection with experiments.
              Such a connection is vital to advance these new theoretical approaches. To
              highlight the need for the connection between experiments and theoretical
              approaches and to present successful examples of how that can be achieved is
              the goal of this symposium.
The general meeting of the American Physical
              Society is 1999 will mark its centennial celebration. This meeting will
              highlight the advances in physics over the last century. As part of this
              meeting there will be a Nobel Laureate Exhibit and Luncheon where more than 40
              Nobel Prize winners have been invited to participate. Vice-president Al Gore
              has also been invited to this event. All Divisions of the APS have been invited
              to organize symposia where the highlights of their contribution to Physics will
              be presented, and where research at the frontier of the field is presented. It
              is very important that biophysics shows its natural strength and need to grow
              during this event.  This conference bridges the gap between theory and
              experiments, as discussed above. This event will consist of a symposium in the
              morning, followed by a contributed section in the afternoon. The topic will be
              "Contrasting New Theories of Protein Folding with Experiments." The American
              Physical Society community will substantially benefit by being exposed to this
              approach of developing biophysics. This meeting will happen in Atlanta during
              the week of 20-26 March of 1999.
