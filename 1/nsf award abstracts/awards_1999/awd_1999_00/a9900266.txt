We propose to develop a novel technique for the fabrication
              of microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) ferrite devices by utilizing
              the thick film glass-ceramic technology to attach high quality ferrite slabs to
              silicon substrates.  The thick glass-ceramic film technology is an established
              technology involved in the manufacturing of integrated circuits, computer
              interconnects, isolation chips, and hybrid microelectronic circuits, although
              it is rarely applied in conjunction with ferrite materials.  For low frequency
              applications (2 - 18 GHz) we plan to use thick glass-ceramic films to attach
              single crystal YIG films to silicon substrates and for frequencies above 18 GHz
              we replace YIG with oriented Y-type ferrites for the first time.  The research
              program entails preparation of oriented Y-type ferrites, microwave
              characterization, fabrication of MMIC devices, modeling of some basic microwave
              circuits and testing.
