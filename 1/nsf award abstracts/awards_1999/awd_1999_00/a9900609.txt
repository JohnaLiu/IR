Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will investigate how the
              interactions of quarks and gluons are modified when the temperature is so high
              that they are not confined inside nucleons.  The properties of this quark-gluon
              plasma are important in understanding the early universe and will be
              investigated experimentally in high energy colliders being built at Brookhaven
              National Laboratory and at CERN.
