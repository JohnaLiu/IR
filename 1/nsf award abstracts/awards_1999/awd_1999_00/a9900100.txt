Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to determine the amount and pattern of genetic
              diversity in the gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), by determining the DNA sequence
              variation at three independent nuclear loci in representatives from all three
              gorilla subspecies, as well as from comparable samples of chimpanzees, humans,
              and orangutans.  These data will placed in a biogeographical perspective to be
              used to determine aspects of the evolutionary history of the gorilla, including
              the phylogenetic relationships between subspecies, the timing of the splits
              between subspecies, and past demographic events such as severe population
              bottlenecks.  Special emphasis will be placed on the taxonomy of gorillas,
              particularly on the use of genetic data to help determine the number of living
              gorilla species.  By comparing the pattern of genetic diversity observed in
              gorillas to that of chimps and humans, this project will also help in
              understanding the evolution of our own species, by providing a comparative
              framework in which to place the large and growing body of data on human genetic
              evolution.  In addition, understanding the genetic substructure of gorillas may
              help in developing conservation programs for these highly endangered apes.
