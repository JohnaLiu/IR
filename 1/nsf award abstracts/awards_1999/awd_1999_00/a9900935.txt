Abstract    :
              This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement research examines the relationship
              between marriage and psychological well being, one of the most comprehensively
              examined relationships in the sociology of mental health literature.   Studies
              comparing married individuals to ones that are unmarried, however, typically
              overlook individuals who are cohabiting.  This omission could become
              increasingly problematic in terms of both theoretical development and policy
              making, as cohabitation becomes more common.  The project will expand research
              on this topic by examining the mechanisms that underlie the relationship
              between marriage and mental health, investigating those mechanisms in
              cohabitation relationships, and assessing the mental health impact of
              transitions from cohabiting to marital relationships.

A cross-section of the
              National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) will be used to compare
              married and cohabitation relationships in terms of their relative effects on
              mental health.  Panels analyses of the NSFH will also be conducted on the NSFH
              to examine changes in mental health among cohabitors who married between one
              wave one and two of the study.  While mechanisms such as social support, coping
              resources, and relationship quality should explain some variation in mental
              health between married and cohabiting individuals, the study proposed that the
              normative nature of marriage will also help to explain for the mental health
              advantages of marriage beyond previously identified
