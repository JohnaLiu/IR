Abstract    :
              The objective of this doctoral dissertation research is to examine how economic
              and political liberalization have transformed the principal actors, targets,
              goals, and forms of popular protests in Mexico, and what conditions have made
              some protests become transnational, others national, and others remain local.
              We hypothesize that when actors (1) are embedded in sustained networks of
              activists and organizations beyond their locality, (2) generate goals that are
              interpretable in multiple ways, and (3) innovate a new form of action, then
              popular protests are able to exploit a new global arena of politics opened by
              the processes of globalization and, thus, make an effective appeal to multiple
              audiences beyond their national territory. The project examines this argument
              through systematic historical analysis of protest events in Mexico from 1960 to
              the present. Protest events reported in Reuters, Excelsior, Uno mas Uno, La
              Jornada, El Imparcial, and El Imparcial de Oaxaca will be gathered and coded by
              using a linguistic approach, and social network analysis will be applied to the
              coded data. This research permits us to consider new relations among global
              market, state, and citizens.
