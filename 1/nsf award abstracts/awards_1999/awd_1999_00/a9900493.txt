Abstract    :
              The proposal describes the application of VCSELs and Smart Pixels to a
              biomedical database scanner.  The goal is to build a  prototype demonstrator
              and to asses the feasibility of a full-scale architecure for hardware-based and
              free-space optics-interconnected database search engine.
