Abstract    :
              Composite steel and concrete members are increasingly used worldwide in the
              primary structural systems for building structures.  These structures are
              designed to take advantage of the properties of both steel and concrete.  In
              early summer 2000, approximately 100 researchers are gathering in Banff, Canada
              for a conference sponsored by the United Engineering Foundation to exchange the
              latest, detailed research findings and present recent case studies relating to
              innovations in composite construction.  This gathering presents a unique
              opportunity to hold a symposium to provide a substantive summary and exchange
              of worldwide research in composite construction, so as to establish firmly the
              state-of-the-art in this area, and to help identify research needs for the next
              several years.  The symposium will permit international researchers and
              practitioners to summarize current worldwide advances and forsee trends in
              innovative composite construction for building structures, with one emphasis of
              the symposium being on the large amount of research that has taken place in the
              U..S. Japan, and other countries in the area of seismic resistance of
              structures.
