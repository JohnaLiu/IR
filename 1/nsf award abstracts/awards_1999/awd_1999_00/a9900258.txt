Abstract    :
              

The proposal describes a program to develop multiwavelength, simultaneous
              emission lasers based on ridge-waveguide distributed Bragg reflector
              semiconductor laser.  The specific example of an application that defines the
              need of such lasers is the differential absorption remote optical sensing of
              water vapor.  A multiwavelength source with closely spaced narrow laser lines
              would be useful to obtain the detailed absorption profile without having to
              turn the laser on and off the absorption peak as is practiced currently.  This
              program is aimed to study and develop a simple multiple wavelength source
              suitable for these types of applications.
