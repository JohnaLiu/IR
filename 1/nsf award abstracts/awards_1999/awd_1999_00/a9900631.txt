This is a study
              of the physical and chemical mechanisms of autoignition of hydrocarbon fuels in
              nonpremixed systems.  The focus is "higher" hydrocarbons, specifically
              n-heptane, iso-octane, n-decane, n-dodecane and toluene.  Experiments are
              conducted in a counterflow configuration; heated oxidizer injected from a duct
              flows against fuel evaporating from the surface of a liquid pool.  The
              temperature the oxidizer stream as a function of the strain rate at ignition is
              measured.  Concentration profiles of various stable species, the temperature
              profile, and the velocity profile at conditions very close to autoignition are
              measured.  Numerical calculations using detailed and reduced chemistry are
              performed and critical parameters for autoignition are calculated and compared
              with experiments.  Rate-ratio asymptotic analyses using reduced chemical
              mechanisms are performed.  Simple analytical formulae are obtained for
              predicting autoignition for the fuels.  Numerical and analytical computations
              are performed in collaboration with Professor Norbert Peters at the Institut
              f?r Technische Mechanik, RWTH Aachen, Germany.
