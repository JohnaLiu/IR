Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design
              and field test an advanced coring system having significant applications in
              geologic investigation, fossil fuel exploration, and environmental remediation.
               Two major shortcomings beset available coring technology: (1) no real-time
              monitoring of the core length in the barrel; and (2) incomplete closure of the
              barrel opening, which may lead to core loss.  While partial core loss is
              generally not a problem in competent formations, it is a problem of some import
              in unconsolidated and highly fractured formations.  Partial core loss is
              estimated in approximately 20% of the wells cored in the U.S. and Canada.  Loss
              of core can be extremely costly, particularly in ocean drilling where rig rates
              can run in excess of $10,000 per hour.  Phase II will elaborate on a feasible
              advanced coring concept from Phase I.  Phase II will develop: (1) an accurate
              electromagnetic core height measurement for cores up to 90 feet in length in
              both water- and oil-based drilling fluids; (2) a mud-pulse telemetry system
              having adequate data rate and well-depth capabilities within commercial cost
              constraints for coring operations; and (3) a reliable full-closure assembly
              actuated by surface operator command.
     This advanced coring system will be
              configured for compatible operation with conventional and wireline-retrievable
              coring systems.  The annual coring services market is estimated at $75 million.
               It is expected that the new full-closure technology will be utilized
              extensively in this market.
