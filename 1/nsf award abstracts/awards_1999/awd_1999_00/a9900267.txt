Abstract    :
                   Dynamic programming is an extremely general framework for the formulation
              and solution of nonlinear discrete optimization problems.  It allows for the
              explicit incorporation of either-or decisions as well as the effects of
              underlying uncertainty that may be present in the system being modeled.  Its
              principal drawback is the tendency for the underlying state space of the 
              formulation to grow explosively with respect to the size of the system.  This
              grant provides funding for the development of procedures to limit to manageable
              proportions the growth of the state space that needs to be considered.  This
              will be accomplished in two ways: (1) Model Simplification though hierarchical
              state aggregation; and (2) Solution Acceleration through state pruning.  The
              former approach can introduce errors which will be controlled through the
              ability to compute bounds on the resulting error of the approximation.
    
              The models and algorithms developed will be implemented and validated on a
              large scale problem in production line design in cooperation with research
              staff at the General Motors R&D Center at Warren, Michigan.  If this research
              effort is successful, the resulting ability to approximately model and optimize
              large scale complex systems with easily implemented dynamic programming
              techniques will greatly expand the class of design and operational problems in
              manufacturing and service sectors that are amenable to analysis.
