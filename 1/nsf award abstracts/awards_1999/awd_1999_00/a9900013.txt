The PI proposes to design, test and develop schemes for (1) safe
              die handling, (2) die attachment with least stress and (3) near outgassing-free
              die attachment for reliable electronic packaging of surface micromachined
              microelectromechanical systems (sm-MEMS). The objective is to work towards
              establishing an infrastructure for reliable packaging of MEMS, which is crucial
              for the successful commercial realization of these devices. The proposed
              program will be executed in a collaboration between High Density Electronics
              Center (HiDEC) at the University of Arkansas, and MEMS packaging group at
              Sandia National Laboratories (SNL).
