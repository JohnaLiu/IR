Abstract    :
              Globular cluster sub-populations: understanding galaxy formation

Jean P.
              Brodie

Globular clusters are relatively simple stellar populations
              consisting of tens of thousands of stars.  These stars are characterized, to
              first order, by a single age and chemical composition.  As fossil remnants of
              the early environments out of which galaxies formed they are powerful probes of
              the processes of galaxy formation and evolution.  Young compact objects,
              apparently globular clusters caught in the process of forming have been
              detected in interacting galaxies.  

Dr. Brodie is conducting a systematic
              spectroscopic study with the Keck 10meter telescopes.  In addition Dr. Bordie
              is  complementing this work with infrared imaging.  The spectroscopy is
              providing information on the ages and chemical abundances of stars in the
              globular clusters.  The goal of the infrared imaging is the detection of sub
              populations of globular clusters in low luminosity ellipticals.
