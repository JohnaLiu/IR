This project is concerned with a number of fairly specific questions
              in algebraic geometry that are pivotal to the development of certain ideas in
              the subject.  These are: the possibility of parametrizing the zeroes of a cubic
              polynomial in five variables; the families of curves contained in the zero
              locus of a cubic polynomial in four variables; the density of the locus where
              the value of a sextic polynomial in three variables is a square; and the
              existence of families of rational curves on quintic threefolds in the zero
              locus of a quintic polynomial in four variables.

Algebraic geometry is the
              study of the geometry of the sets of solutions to polynomial equations.  By
              analyzing the algebra of polynomials, we come to understand the geometry of
              their solution sets; and from a knowledge of these sets we arrive ultimately at
              a deeper and more effective understanding of algebra.
