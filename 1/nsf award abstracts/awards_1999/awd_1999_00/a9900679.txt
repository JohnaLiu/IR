W/WS: Development and testing of a decision support
              system for river restoration

The objective of this research is to use an
              interdisciplinary approach to explore how landscape change affects river
              ecosystems, and to evaluate restoration priorities. Using spatial data, the
              investigators will quantify landscape properties as possible predictors of
              stream condition.  Physical and biological variables will provide independent
              assessment of stream condition, enabling the PIs to determine relationships
              between human activities and the ecological state of the river system. 
              Available best management practices and innovative forms of human settlement
              that are preferred by the local community will be integrated into statistical
              models between land use and stream condition to examine the interaction between
              social acceptability and restoration potential.  Through economic evaluation of
              alternative land management practices the PIs will evaluate the costs of
              restoration alternatives. The expected outcome is a generalized set of
              quantitative analysis tools that will enable decision-makers to target
              rehabilitation needs and opportunities based on innovative alternatives to land
              use, expected impact on ecological integrity, and estimated cost.
