Abstract    :
              9900798
     This study will address the issue of proper quantification of
              uncertainty
in decision making--particularly in the area of design. This lack
              of
quantified assessments of uncertainty results in
              incomplete
characterization of product design and investment alternatives.
              The
emphasis will be on real-world applications including energy-related
              and
space-related product examples. The problem of databases for
              describing
multi-attribute (specifically including risk) decisions when the
              engineer
or analyst is not the final decision maker will also be examined.
  
                The results of proper characterization of risk and uncertainty
              has
application to all aspects of decision making including product design.
              The
resulting applications-driven theory would be robust and lead to
              improved
decision making.
