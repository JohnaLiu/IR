Abstract    :
              The project will develop an algorithmic design methodology for
designing
              Dynamic libraries. Configuration design techniques
based on Parameterized
              Computation Structures will be developed
for the library. Parameterized
              Computation Structures are designs
optimized for a specific computation based
              on the algorithm and
input instance and thus can lead to compact and efficient
              designs.
The computation structures will incorporate run-time
              instantiation
and optimization techniques resulting in a Dynamic library.
              The
Dynamic library components will be modular and scalable. The 
methodology
              will also exploit partial and dynamic reconfiguration.
The performance of the
              resulting designs will be evaluated using 
total execution time as a metric.
              The total execution time includes
reconfiguration time in addition to
              execution time on the hardware.
This effort is expected to significantly
              advance the understanding 
of configurable architectures and result in the
              development of 
dynamic configurable structures.
