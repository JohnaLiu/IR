Abstract    :
              High Frequency Methods for Solutions to Structural-Acoustic Systems with
              Significant Damping

The objective of this research is to develop new
              analysis tools for solving structural dynamics and acoustics problems that are
              subjected to high frequency broadband excitations, have high modal density, and
              are not lightly damped.  Such systems are typical of those actually encountered
              in transportation and flight vehicles.  Currently, these systems are poorly
              understood and can only be solved accurately using methods requiring extensive
              computation.  The project contains theoretical, computational, and experimental
              work.  Two parallel efforts will be undertaken: one using boundary elements
              formulated from time-averaged energy/intensity variables, and the other
              extending asymptotic modal analysis to cases where the modes are not uncoupled.
               In addition to the development of a simple, efficient approach to solving high
              modal density systems with significant amounts of damping, the work will focus
              on understanding the mechanisms involved and gaining insights into the behavior
              of these high frequency systems.
