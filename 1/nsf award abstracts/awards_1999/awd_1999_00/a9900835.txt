Abstract    :
              Advanced measurement of large scale structure:  The Las Campanas redshift survey
              and beyond.

Stephen D. Landy

Dr. Landy is developing new analytical and
              statistical tools that extract information from the Las Campanas Redshift
              Survey.  In particular, Dr. Landy is investigating large scale structure above
              50 mega parsecs in size.  The Las Campanas survey contains redshifts to more
              than 26,000 galaxies over 700 square degrees on the sky.  The main focus of the
              work is to adapt and apply the Karhumen-Loeve (K-L) transform analysis
              technique to these data.  The K-L transform method derives optimal weight for
              the varied data in a large survey.
