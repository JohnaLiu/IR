Abstract    :
              
A conference on "non-perturbative particle dynamics" will be held at the Aspen
              Center for Physics, January 10-16, 1999.  This conference on aspects of
              theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on problems in which the
              effects of the strong nuclear force are very powerful and the approximation
              that this force is weak cannot be used.  The conference will also deal with new
              developments in string theory, a candidate for a theory of all the forces of
              nature.  It has recently been found that string theory may shed considerable
              light on the physics of systems whose behavior is governed by the strong
              nuclear force.

The conference will promote a very important exchange of
              ideas among experts in different, but related, areas of elementary particle
              physics.
