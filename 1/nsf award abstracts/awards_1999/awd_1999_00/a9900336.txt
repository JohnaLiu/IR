"Long-term Performance of GCLs:  Permeated with Aqueous
              Inorganic Solutions"

Long-Term Performance of GCLs Permeated with Aqueous Inorganic
              Solutions
Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are factory-manufactured hydraulic
              barriers
consisting of a thin layer of bentonite (~ 5.0 kg/m2) sandwiched
              between
two geotextiles or bonded to a geomembrane. Since 1992, GCLs have been
              used
widely in hydraulic containment applications because of their
              relatively
low cost and very low hydraulic conductivity to water (k 10E-8
              cm/s).
However, most applications using GCLs involve the containment of
              chemical
solutions that may be incompatible with the bentonite portion of the
              GCLs,
and the results of most hydraulic conductivity tests on GCLs are
              performed
over relatively short test durations (e.g., 6 mos.). As a result,
              the
primary objective of this study, a joint effort between Colorado
              State
University (CSU) and the University of Wisconsin at Madison (UWM), is
              to
evaluate the long-term performance of geosynthetic clay liners
              (GCLs)
permeated with aqueous inorganic solutions over test durations ranging
              from
6 mos. to 3 yrs. Physical, hydraulic, and mechanical properties of the
              GCLs
both before and after exposure to permeation with distilled water and
              salt
solutions will be determined. The research will include tests to
              evaluate
the long-term hydraulic conductivity, swell, shear strength, and
              diffusion
properties of GCLs. In addition, an exchange program between CSU and
              UWM
will be established based for both educational and research
              dissemination
purposes. The results of this study will advance our
              understanding of the
long-term behavior of GCLs, and should impact the design
              of waste
containment systems involving GCLs.
