Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Richard Zare of Stanford University will obtain
              quantum-state-specific information on the dynamics of elementary gas-phase and
              gas-surface chemical reactions using molecular beam and laser spectroscopic
              methods.  Experiments will povide the complete three-dimensional velocity
              distribution of products from the fundamental reactions H + D2 yield HD(v,J) +
              D and Cl + HD(v=1) yield HCl(v,J) + D or DCl(v,J) + H; measurement of alignment
              and orientation of fragments produced by molecular photodissociation; and
              characterization of speed, scattering angle, internal quantum state, and
              polarization of products produced by gas-surface reactions.  

The
              information obtained in this work enables chemists to understand better how
              chemical transformations occur by providing detailed observations that can be
              compared against the predictions of the best theoretical calculations.  With
              such a better understanding it should be possible to engineer chemical
              reactions to give higher yields of desired products, resulting in less time
              spent separating and purifying reactions products and less energy expended in
              the entire process.  A detailed knowledge of chemical reactions is also
              important in understanding atmospheric processes such as the interactions of
              greenhouse gases with light, other gases, and surfaces.
