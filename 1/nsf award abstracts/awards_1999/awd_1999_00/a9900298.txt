This is a three-year standard
              award. This project aims to investigate a concrete spectrum of issues of
              relevance to the development of teams of complete robot agents in dynamic,
              real-time, and adversarial environments. The proposed research will investigate
              and develop agents that are: (1) autonomous - with on-board sensing, planning,
              and acting,  (2) efficient - capable of achieving specific goals under time and
              resource constraints through the integration of deliberative and reactive
              planning, (3) cooperative - capable of collaborating with each other to
              accomplish tasks that are beyond individual's capabilities, and (4) adaptive -
              capable of learning from experience by refining their individual and
              collaborative action selection preferences.This multi-agent robotic research
              will be carried within the context of robotic soccer. The robotic soccer domain
              introduces many specific research topics, including: (i) complete integration
              of perception, action, and cognition in a team of multiple robotic agents; (ii)
              definition of a set of robust reactive planning behaviors for individual agents
              (each agent should be equipped with skills that enable it to effectively
              perform individual and collaborative actions); (iii) reliable, real-time and
              active visual perception, including tracking of multiple moving objects and
              prediction of object movement; (iv) multi-agent strategic reasoning. The
              proposed work will build upon the research experience of the
U.S. research
              group on planning and learning and on the Brazilian research group on real-time
              perception.
