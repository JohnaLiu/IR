The observational properties of
              intermediate and low mass stars have been well documented in most phases of
              their evolution, from the main sequence to the white dwarf phase.  The most
              poorly observed phase of evolution, however, is the transition from red giants
              to planetary nebulae, in what is known as the proto-planetary nebulae (PPN)
              phase. This is because the transition occurs relatively rapidly; the stars are
              often significantly obscured by circumstellar dust; and because until recently
              there was not efficient means to identify such objects. In the past decade,
              however, as a result of observations obtained from the IRAS satellite infrared
              sky survey, about 50 good PPN candidates have been identified based upon the
              infrared emission from their dust shells.

The goal of this project is to
              determine quantitatively the observational properties of the central stars and
              circumstellar shells of a representative number of objects in this transitional
              phase.  High-resolution spectroscopic observations will be obtained at visible
              and near-infrared wavelengths. From the data of these observations, the
              photospheric abundances and the chemistry and dynamics of the circumstellar
              envelopes will be determined. The results will help test theories of
              nucleosynthesis and mass loss in low- and medium-mass stars. It has been found
              that most proto-planetary nebulae vary in brightness and also pulsate.  The
              pulsation velocity is measured by observing the Doppler effects in the observed
              emissions from the stars.  This unique program to monitor this variability of
              the proto-planetary nebulae will be carried out over the next three years.  In
              principle, the results obtained may lead to information on the internal
              structure of these objects
