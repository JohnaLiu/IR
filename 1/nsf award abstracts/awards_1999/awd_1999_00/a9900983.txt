Abstract    :
              This project is a companion to ATM-9901070 (PI: J. Birn).  The two proposals
              taken together are designed to produce a computer model of the Earth's
              magnetotail and how the tail interacts with the inner magnetosphere.  It will
              couple the tail-MHD computer code of Birn and Hesse with the Rice Convection
              Model and a magnetofriction code.  The model will solve a closed set of partial
              differential equations which describe the magnetotail and the plasma sheet and
              their coupling to the inner magnetosphere and ionosphere.  Ultimately this
              computer code will be used as a module for the Geospace General Circulation
              Model (GGCM), which is one of the primary goals of the Geospace Environment
              Modeling (GEM) program
