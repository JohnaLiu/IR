Abstract    :
              Maser emission from accretion disks and dense circumnuclear gas in AGN

Powerful extragalactic sources of water maser emission - the
              water megamasers - are exclusively associated with galaxies showing evidence
              for an active galactic nucleus.  Recent work has shown that production of water
              maser emission via irradiation of dense circumnuclear gas by the x-rays from an
              active galactic nucleus can explain the observed water maser emission.  Dr.
              Maloney is extending earlier work on the production of water maser emission
              from accretion disks.  In addition, Dr. Maloney is constructing models that
              take into account the full vertical and radial structure of the disk, the
              influence of velocity gradients, dust absorption, free-free absorption on the
              observable maser emission, and the actual irradiation geometry of an obliquely
              illuminated disk.
