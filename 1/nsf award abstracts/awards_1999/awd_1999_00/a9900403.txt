Abstract    :
              In this RUI project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of
              the Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biophysics Program of the Division of
              Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, an integrated approach will be employed to
              characterize supramolecular assemblies using Resonance Light Scattering (RLS)
              and other spectroscopic and kinetic techniques, such as absorption
              spectroscopy, circular dichroism, resonance Raman, and static and dynamic light
              scattering.  Much of the effort will focus on systems involving meso-structures
              or assembly-to-assembly interactions.  The approach will involve studies of
              assembly structure, the kinetics of assembly formation, and organizations of
              assemblies. The assemblies of principal interest are biological molecules, such
              as DNA and peptides with porphyrin chromophores and chromophore assemblies in
              bacterial chlorosomes.  However porphyrin- and phthalocyanine-containing
              fibers, films and liquid crystals will also be examined.  The project is an
              inter-institutional effort involving Swarthmore, Haverford, and Goucher
              Colleges.  

Studies of large macromolecular aggregates form a basis for
              exploring the structure of ordered systems involved in various biochemical and
              materials science applications.  This project will increase understanding of
              the structure of chlorosomes, which are the light-harvesting apparatus of green
              photosynthetic bacteria, as well as of liquid crystals and thin films.  The
              latter two materials find application in sensors, solar collectors, and
              nonlinear optical devices.
