The Association of American State Geologists will conduct a
              two-year program to provide undergraduate students in geoscience with
              field-oriented research experiences.  The objectives of the program are to have
              the nation's state geological surveys better train students in scientific field
              techniques and geologic mapping and to excite and encourage students to pursue
              careers in geoscience.  This program will enable these students to work in the
              field, side by side with experienced geologic mappers and field geologists, who
              will be both teachers and mentors.  The success of the program will be assessed
              by interviewing students and their teacher/mentors and tracking the students'
              careers.  These compiled data will be reported to the general geoscience
              community.  Individual state surveys will select students from geoscience
              departments and summer field camp programs nationwide and from the summer
              field-training program administered by the National Association of Geoscience
              Teachers.  It is expected that most state field projects will be linked to
              funded research through the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program (in
              cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey) or other federal, state, local
              agencies or the private sector programs.
