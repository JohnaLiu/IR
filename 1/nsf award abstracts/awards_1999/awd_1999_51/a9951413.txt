Abstract    :
              
This project addresses the need for K-12 teachers of mathematics to use
              technology effectively and to have a thorough understanding of mathematical
              concepts.  The typical mathematics methods or content course for preservice
              teachers, however, offers few opportunities to address both of these issues in
              a coherent and unified manner.  In this project, a library of "transitions
              modules" for use in mathematics and content courses for preservice teachers
              ranging from the early childhood to the secondary level are being developed. 
              Focusing on a single mathematical concept, each transitions module leads the
              student through a series of investigations using a number of different
              technologies.  Hence, the term technology refers to any tool for doing or
              teaching mathematics, including manipulatives, paper and pencil, calculators,
              computers, and the Internet.  These activities foster experiences in comparing
              and contrasting the uses of different technologies in learning and teaching
              mathematics.  They also promote better mathematical understanding through the
              use of multiple technologies applied to the same problem.  Once developed, the
              transitions modules are being grouped by courses into laboratory manuals and
              disseminated nationally via the World Wide Web.  Commercial publication is also
              envisioned in either traditional book form or on a CD-ROM.  A comprehensive
              evaluation plan is being implemented in order to measure the effects of the
              modules on teaching and learning.
