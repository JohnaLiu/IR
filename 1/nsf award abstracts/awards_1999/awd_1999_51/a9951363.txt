Abstract    :
              The goal of this 2-year project is to improve student learning of physics at
              Jefferson Community College by implementing active learning through
              microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL) and interactive lecture demonstrations
              (ILDs) in all physics and physical science courses.  The use of MBL and ILDs
              has dramatically improved students conceptual understanding at colleges that
              have implemented this type of technology as shown by the research of P. Laws,
              D. Sokoloff and R. Thornton.  A small pilot MBL class of introductory physics,
              team-taught by the PI and another instructor in spring of 1999 using the
              RealTime Physics curriculum (Mechanics) without adaptation, confirmed that
              students using MBL had higher scores on posttests than traditional lecture
              course students.  Other results of the pilot study indicated that the students
              had trouble staying on task during 2-hour lab periods.  To adapt and implement
              the RealTime Physics curriculum to better suit the student population at our
              institution, the MBL activities are modified into shorter tasks, with both
              small group work (2-3 students) and larger group work (entire class) with
              coaching from the instructor and integrating ILDs in the course.  The project
              includes adapting and implementing the MBL and ILDs currently in use and
              developing new MBL activities and ILDs for the physical science course, which
              covers both physics and chemistry topics.  The faculty members are gaining
              experience with the software, the equipment, and the active learning
              environment in local and national workshops and team-teaching assignments that
              partner an instructor new to MBL with a more experienced colleague. This
              project can serve as a model for the implementation of MBL and active learning
              in physics and physical science in a two-year college setting.
