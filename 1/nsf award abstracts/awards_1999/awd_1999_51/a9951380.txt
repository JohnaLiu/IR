Abstract    :
              This project develops two laboratory-based courses on computer network security.
              The first course is aimed at the senior undergraduate majoring in computer
              science or computer engineering. The other course will be of short duration
              with multiple lectures and laboratory exercises per day to run over a period of
              3 days. This course is a continuation of the first course and aimed at computer
              savvy users.  It is expected to be offered in a continuing education format. 
              Both courses feature guest lectures on legal issues, social responsibility and
              ethics.

Fifteen laboratory experiments are being developed to be conducted
              on isolated LANs. These include team projects to strengthen the basic and
              experimental understanding of firewalls. All the laboratory work is being
              conducted in a proposed laboratory of PC-clones capable of running both Unix
              (Linux) and Windows NT/2000. The laboratory setup is being documented
              thoroughly for use by other institutions planning to offer courses on
              firewalls. Based upon successful evaluation of the proof-of-concept of the new
              courses and lab exercises, the lecture notes and lab exercises will be
              disseminated on a web site.
