Abstract    :
              This K-8 curriculum has developed spatial-temporal reasoning skills with the
              framework of already established Earth Sciences content standards.  The
              instructional methods used include applications of geographic information
              systems (GIS), which constitutes a powerful medium advancing spatial and
              temporal literacy of students, and satisfies the standards-based reform
              movements emphasis on inquiry-based constructivists learning, critical thinking
              skills, group learning, and the interdisciplinary nature of science. This new
              curricula is being developed and implemented within the framework of an
              interactive association between the San Diego State University pre-service
              teacher training program, and K-8 students and in-service teachers from local
              school districts.  The strong formative assessment allows for iterative
              development of new curricula.  K-8 pre-service teachers from the SDSU Liberal
              Studies program are recruited and trained to present the new curriculum
              materials serving the dual purpose of providing "on-the-job-training" for
              pre-service teachers, while learning Earth Science content. San Diego State
              University has a strong infrastructure to support curriculum development
              because the elementary and middle schools in the San Diego metropolitan area
              include students from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.  Results of
              this project are being disseminated via the Web, CD-ROMs, professional meetings
              and publications.
