Abstract    :
              This proof-of-concept project is producing, evaluating, and refining multimedia
              modules in linear algebra, complex analysis for engineers, and partial
              differential equations that can serve as a basis for a comprehensive package of
              educational materials.  The goal of the project is to use new technology in a
              way that makes it easier for (1) students to succeed in distance, asynchronous,
              and "just-in-time" learning environments and (2) faculty to incorporate modules
              of materials into different courses in a variety of disciplines.

The project
              is using technical tools similar to the Elementary Linear Algebra materials
              designed for use at Virginia Tech and now being prepared for national
              distribution. The basic components are a set of interconnected web-based
              electronic books ("e-books"), a series of traditional texts, and CD-ROMs. The
              e-books and CD-ROMs contain video clips, highly interactive instructional
              modules, and self-assessment tools.

Virginia Tech's Math Emporium is being
              used as the test-bed for these products. The Emporium is a 50,000 square foot,
              500 computer facility designed to promote asynchronous computer-based learning
              with readily available human instructional support.
