Abstract    :
              The Chemistry and Biochemistry programs are aggressively restructuring the
              undergraduate curricula. The motivation for these curricular changes stems from
              the commitment to challenge students at an earlier stage in their development,
              reduce repetition and prepare them better for the demands associated with
              independent research (which is a graduation requirement for all majors). The
              best way for students to learn science is through engagement in well-designed,
              hands-on, investigative laboratory experiences that expose them to the
              excitement of research and ignite their interest in science. The investigative
              laboratories utilize capillary electrophoresis (CE) and isothermal titration
              calorimetry (ITC) in order to provide these opportunities at an early stage to
              the students. The laboratories adapt gains from  NSF funded projects dealing
              with ITC (NSF-DUE 9850820, NSF- DUE 9851231 and NSF-DUE 9452346). The
              incorporation of these exciting new technologies into the undergraduate
              teaching labs enables a significant expansion of the experiences offered by
              allowing students to collect physical and analytical data rapidly and with
              great precision. These exercises better prepare students for the independent
              research experience by repeated exposure to modern methodologies and
              instrumentation, analytical skills and hypothesis testing. The instrumentation
              is introduced in the context of biological, organic and physical chemistry, as
              well as cell biology.  Additionally, the instrumentation supports student
              thesis research and independent study projects.
