Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to enhance the chemistry curriculum at Kansas City
              Kansas Community College (KCKCC) by incorporating the theory and practice of
              Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy in our honors college chemistry
              course and all of our organic chemistry courses.  The incorporation of new
              instrumentation in our laboratory enhances our chemistry curriculum through
              hands-on reinforcement of lecture material using state-of-the-art
              instrumentation.  This allows for the modernization of existing experiments
              (Bishop & Bishop, 1996; Wilcox & Wilcox, 1995) and the introduction of new
              experiments (Wilson, 1996 and Van Ripwyk, 1997 funded by NSF ILI grants
              DUE-9252116 and DUE-9350633, respectively). 

The Physics, Biology, and
              Mortuary Sciences Departments utilize this equipment to analyze gases,
              serological samples, and other solids.  In addition, the forthcoming
              incorporation of a Kansas Bureau of Investigations (KBI) Satellite Facility at
              KCKCC (funded by Senate Bill 481) informs students about many of the uses of
              FT-IR spectroscopy in forensic science and criminology.

The majority of our
              students who take the chemistry courses affected by this instrumentation
              transfer to State of Kansas universities and four-year colleges.  The addition
              of this instrumentation in our courses allows our students to be as prepared as
              the students who take their first two years of chemistry courses from other
              institutions.
