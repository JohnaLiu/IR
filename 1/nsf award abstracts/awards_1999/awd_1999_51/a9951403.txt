Abstract    :
              The technique of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is incorporated
              across the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at Southwestern Oklahoma State
              University through a conversion to an existing Varian EM-360.  This conversion
              consists of the Anasazi EFT-60 FT Conversion Package with 13C Accessory.  The
              converted instrument permits the inclusion of chemical structure, reactivity,
              kinetics, and equilibria into the lecture and laboratories of our curriculum. 
              In general chemistry structural analysis, along with basic theory and
              instructions, allow students to analyze simple organic compounds.  In organic
              chemistry, NMR theory is discussed in detail and the complexity of molecules
              analyzed increases.  Students identify products of reactions using GC, FTIR,
              and 1H and 13C NMR methods.  Kinetics and equilibria of selected reactions are
              studied using NMR in physical chemistry.  COSY, 2D NMR, and the effects of
              shift reagents are studied in instrumental analysis.  Additionally,
              undergraduate research students use the NMR for analysis.  Gains from NSF
              funded projects at West Virginia University and the University of Central
              Oklahoma are adapted for incorporating NMR methods across the curriculum and
              significantly improving student understanding of NMR theory and techniques. 
              Additionally, methods of archival analysis are adapted from funded works at
              Grinnell College.
