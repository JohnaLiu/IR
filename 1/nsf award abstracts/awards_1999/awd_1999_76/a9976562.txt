Abstract    :
              Triad Women in Science and Technology (TWIST) is a collaboration among colleges,
              universities, and secondary education in the Piedmont Triad of  North Carolina.
               Its purpose is to develop relationships and opportunities that will allow
              Triad women and girls, from the 11th grade through college graduation, to see
              and to experience science, mathematics, and technology as attractive career
              options.  While many of the TWIST partners have developed independent programs
              and initiatives to support their own students, most lack the time and resources
              to develop comprehensive programs that would guide and support women in
              choosing science as a career.  Nor can most devote personnel to establishing
              the community linkages - with industry, professional science organizations, and
              faculty at other institutions - that could benefit their students considering
              science careers.  The TWIST project seeks to coordinate and to assess existing
              programs among its partnering organizations; to develop new programs that will
              facilitate interaction among Triad women in science; and to foster integration
              of the education community with the larger scientific and industrial community
              in the region.  The formation of TWIST allows the participating institutions to
              learn from each other, to share resources and experiences, and to plan
              effectively for a program that will benefit female students throughout the
              Triad.  Each institution will derive strength and energy from working
              collaboratively.
