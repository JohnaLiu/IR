This project extends previous work on mixtures of local linear
              models, and global nonlinear models (e.g. neural networks) for nonlinear
              principal component analysis (PCA).  The application domains addressed include
              transform coding, data visualization, and sensor fusion, with initial focus on
              image processing.  Theoretical focus is on securing  a foundation for the
              algorithms in terms of generative (probabilistic) models.  Applications to be
              explored include sensor fusion to improve the quality of airport radio, and
              video data compression to improve the performance at systems like Internet
              video communications.

A class of constrained mixture models that incorporate
              latent, unobserved variables together with probabilistic maps int0 observed
              data space has suitable properties; they naturally express nonlinear PCA, and
              they contain mixture, or local linear PCA (as well as standard PCA) in
              appropriate limits.  Hence these models can serve as an organizing focus behind
              algorithms for coding, visualization, and fusion that are related to nonlinear
              PCA.

This project will develop these models, their theoretical properties,
              the art of fitting and regularizing them, and their application to coding and
              visualization.  The models are capable of expressing, both cluster structure,
              and curved surface models of data, and are thus well suited for visualization. 
              Such probabilistic models can help illuminate other relation between nonlinear
              PCA and independent component analysis (ICA).
