Abstract    :
              The goal of this planning grant is to complete preparation to submit a well
              researched and designed proposal to the NSF Gender Equity program for a large
              collaborative grant in next year's funding cycle.  this grant will enable a
              range of activities increasing the involvement of girls and women from the
              fourth grade through college in math and science.  Under the planning grant, we
              will investigate and research a possible large collaborative project involving
              
  -  after-school science clubs for elementary and middle school girls,
  - 
              after-school science clubs, internships and summer science camps for high
              school girls, 
  - training community college and four-year college women
              students to lead and mentor high school girls in         after-school science
              clubs and summer science camps, 
  - investigating and improving the climate
              for gender equity for girls and women in the partner 	           
              institutions,
  -  and educating middle school, high school, community
              college, and four-year college faculty in issues of       gender equity in the
              teaching of math and science.
The middle and high school activities will take
              place throughout three large school districts in partnership with three
              non-profit public service organizations, a community college and a four-year
              college.
