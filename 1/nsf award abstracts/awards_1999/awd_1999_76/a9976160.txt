Abstract    :
              Inter-group violence has often been seen as an inevitable characteristic of the
              postcolonial predicament, a view ignores the crucial historical role played by
              colonial powers in establishing criminal justice systems and law enforcement
              agencies for colonized peoples. This research analyzes the intersection of
              criminal justice, violence and dispute resolution on the Ionian Islands during
              the period in which they were part of the British Empire. Analysis of archival
              records is undertaken to clarify how colonial officials responded to violence. 
              It is hypothesized that indigenous codes of conduct, including
              socially-sanctioned violence, shaped the actual application of the law in ways
              that transformed both the role of the law and the role of government in local
              affairs. The study will contribute to a better understanding of violence and
              dispute resolution in colonial contexts through historically-informed analysis.
