	This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a
              multicollector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) to be
              installed and operated by the Department of Geological Sciences at the
              University of Arizona. The University of Arizona is committed to providing the
              remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. Research applications at the
              University of Arizona requiring the capabilities of the MC-ICP-MS include (1)
              Origin of metal deposits at convergent plate margins from Os and Pb isotope
              analysis, (2) Life in extreme environments from Fe, Cu, and Zn isotopes, (3)
              Origin of silicic magma chambers from in situ Sr analysis of feldspars, (4)
              History of crust and mantle evolution using Hf isotopes, (5) Geochronology of
              convergent plate margins using in-situ U-Pb in zircons, and (6) U-Th dating of
              carbonate soils and calibration of the C-14 time scale by U-Th dating of
              speleothems and corals.
