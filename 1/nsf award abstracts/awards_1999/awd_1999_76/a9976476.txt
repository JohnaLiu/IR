Abstract    :
              Robert Levis of Wayne State University is supported by the Experimental Physical
              Chemistry Program for research that focuses on the interaction of polyatomic
              molecules with intense near-infrared laser pulses of femtosecond duration. The
              objectives of this project are to elucidate the coupling mechanism between an
              intense laser and a polyatomic molecule, to understand the factors leading to
              dissociation during intense laser ionization, and to develop a time-dependent
              picture of the radiation molecule interaction.  Photoelectron spectroscopy and
              time-of-flight mass spectrometry measurements will delineate the coupling
              mechanisms for various classes of molecules, revealing the experimental
              observables of ionization and dissociation probability and the electron kinetic
              energy distributions.  Energy partitioning between electronic and nuclear
              degrees of freedom will be determined from fragment ion kinetic energy
              distributions and electron-ion coincidence experiments.  Finally, time-resolved
              experiments will provide a detailed picture of the evolution of a molecule in
              an intense laser field.  

Extremely intense light induces far different
              behaviors in molecules than does the same color, but weaker light.  The ability
              of intense light to result in unusual dissociation and ionization processes is
              assisting in the development of novel optical methods such as high harmonic
              generation devices and x-ray lasers. Outcomes from these studies have potential
              applications in a universal ionization method for biological mass spectrometry,
              new detection methods for chemical reaction dynamics, and methods for coherent
              control.
