This award
              will assist the Carnegie Institution in the acquisition of a cluster of Alpha
              workstations for use by researchers and students at the Department of
              Terrestrial Magnetism and the Geophysical Laboratory.  The cluster will be used
              for a wide range of scientific research, principally in theoretical studies of
              the origin of stars, planets, and life itself.  These three areas of origins
              research form a major component of the Carnegie Institution's research effort. 
              The acquisition of the cluster of workstations will enable this
              interdisciplinary research effort to be extended to higher spatial resolutions,
              longer time scales, and more complex molecules.
