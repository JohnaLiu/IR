	This award provides partial funding support for the acquisition
              of an X-ray microdiffractometer system to be installed and operated in the
              Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Carnegie
              Institution is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the
              acquisition. The Geophysical Laboratory research group is engaged in several
              research projects investigating the behavior of matter at high pressures and
              temperatures. Synthesized samples from their experiments are often quite small,
              requiring microdiffraction techniques to characterize them fully.
