Abstract

	The correct interpretation of a sentence
              requires, among many other things, knowing which objects or actors named in the
              sentence played which roles in the event the sentence describes.  In the
              sentence "The man bit the dog", for example, one needs to understand who did
              the biting in order to understand the sentence correctly.  This interpretive
              process is referred to as binding thematic roles to concepts.  The goal of this
              project is to develop and test a theory of how people do this in comprehending
              sentences communicated to them by others.  

	Pilot work has shown that the
              process is not nearly so simple and straightforward as previous research has
              assumed.  Even unambiguous sentences present surprising difficulties of
              interpretation.  For example, undergraduate college students hearing the
              sentence "The dog was bitten by the man" misidentify the biter about a quarter
              of the time, even though they almost always correctly interpret "The man bit
              the dog".  

	The project breaks down into three components:  

(1) To
              develop a mechanism for assigning thematic roles through syntax, which can
              explain how phrases become vulnerable to misinterpretation.
(2) To provide an
              account of how that mechanism works with a parallel system that provides
              information about thematic roles via schematic knowledge.
(3) To provide
              evidence regarding the kinds of influences that can exaggerate or ameliorate
              thematic misinterpretation, including linguistic, schematic, and individual
              difference variables.
