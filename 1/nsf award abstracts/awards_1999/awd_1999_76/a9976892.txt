	This pilot project involves cultural anthropologists from the
              University of California-Davis studying the relationship between cultural
              diversity in Mesoamerica and diversity in crop species.  The general hypothesis
              to be tested is that cultural differences involve different farming practices
              which result in different races of corn (maize) being cultivated.  The
              researchers will study maize farmers in three locations in Chiapas, Mexico, two
              Mayan Indian and one non-Indian Mestizo community.  The researchers, working
              with Mexican colleagues from ECOSUR, a southern Mexican research institution,
              will interview farmers whose primary language is Tzeltal, Tzotzil (two local
              Mayan Indian languages corresponding to different local cultures) and Spanish,
              in two altitude zones, from 1000 to 1800 meters and above 1800 meters.  Between
              15 and 30 households in each of 4-5 communities in each language group, for a
              total of 12-16 communities will be sampled according to language, altitude and
              relation to market centers or urban services. Respondents will be asked to rank
              different maize varieties according to agronomic and cultural criteria (yield,
              risk, storage, cooking quality, etc. ). Collections will be made of the
              different varieties of maize encountered.  This research will advance our
              understanding of this important food crop in the general region where it was
              first domesticated.  The new knowledge to be created will be valuable in
              planning programs to preserve genetic diversity of maize as a resource for the
              future.
