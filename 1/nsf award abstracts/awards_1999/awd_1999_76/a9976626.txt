Abstract    :
              This proposal is being submitted to the NSF-CONACyT Collaborative Research
              program. This project will be performed in collaboration with ITESM, Campus
              Morelos, Mexico.                                                               
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                       Mobile ad hoc networks consist of wireless mobile
              hosts that communicate with each other, in the absence of a fixed
              infrastructure.  Routes between two hosts in a Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET)
              may consist of hops through other hosts in the network.                        
                                                                                             
                              
Geocasting is a variation on the notion of multicasting.  A
              geographical area, called geocast region, is associated with a geocast, and a
              geocast message is delivered to all nodes present in the geocast region.
              Geocasting is useful to deliver messages of interest to all hosts within a
              given area.  In mobile ad hoc networks, membership of a geocast group changes
              whenever hosts move in and out of the geocast region.                          
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                Primary objective of this project is to develop flooding-based and tree-based
              approaches for geocasting in MANET and to evaluate their performance. 
              Performance evaluation will be based on simulations as well as a prototype
              implementation.  Because geocasts are directed towards a specified geocast
              region, use of directional antennas (instead of omnidirectional antennas) is
              expected to improve performance of geocasting in mobile ad hoc networks. 
              Therefore, this project will also design medium access protocols for MANET
              using directional antennas, and evaluate performance of geocasting with
              directional antennas.
