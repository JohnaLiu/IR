Abstract    :
              This one-year planning grant proposal is to enable the key collaborating
              organizations, Washington University, The St. Louis Science Center, St. Louis
              Academy of Sciences, and the Cooperating School Districts of St. Louis, to
              build an effort that will culminate in the submission of a Large Collaborative
              Project for the Program for Gender Equity in Science, Mathematics, Engineering
              and Technology.  During this period a steering committee representing each of
              the organizations will define the roles of each, identify specific SMET
              activities for participants, establish a mentoring process, define which and
              how participants will be recruited, develop an assessment and evaluation plan,
              establish means for dissemination of the activities of the project, identify
              and form an advisory board, and prepare and submit the final proposal.
