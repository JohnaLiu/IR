The Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at
              the University of Alabama-Tuscaloosa establishes a summer program for faculty
              and educators in the mathematical and physical sciences from Historically Black
              Colleges and Universities (HBCU).  The goal of the one-month program is to
              acquaint minority students, through their professors, with the field of
              materials science and engineering.  The program is organized in a Gordon
              conference style, and includes traditional and non-traditional classes with a
              combination of hands-on laboratory and computer activities and visits to
              industrial materials plants.

The program allows HBCU faculty to incorporate
              various aspects of materials science and engineering into their mathematical
              and physical science courses.  It also allows them to inform their current and
              future students about the discipline of materials and to make them aware of
              employment and graduate school opportunities in the field.  This award is
              supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and by the Division of
              Materials Research of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences.
