Abstract    :
              

This proposal was submitted to the NSF-CONACyT (EPDT) Program. It involves
              researchers at three institutions, namely the University of Central Florida,
              and two Mexican universities, INAOE (Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica Optica y
              Electronica) and BUAP (Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla). 

This
              proposal is for a collaborative research program for the investigation of new
              organic materials for photonics device applications. Specifically, the goal is
              to develop highly efficient and photochemically and thermally stable
              chromophers for nonlinear optics.  The technology may be also important for and
              has potential impact on polymer optical fibers, amplifiers/laser research, and
              perhaps even light-emitting devices.
