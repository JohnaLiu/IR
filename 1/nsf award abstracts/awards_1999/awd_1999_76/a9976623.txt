Abstract    :
              A wealth of studies in adults suggests that acetylcholine (a chemical in the
              brain) plays an important role in cognitive processes such as spatial learning
              and memory.  Considerably less is known about the role that acetylcholine plays
              in the developing mammal, and how this chemical may help to establish the
              complex neural circuitry that will underlie cognitive processes later in life. 
              The proposed study will explore the role of acetylcholine in early postnatal
              development in rat by examining how cognitive processes develop in the absences
              of this chemical.  Furthermore, the proposed study will examine how other
              neurochemical systems may compensate for the loss of acetylcholine.  This
              neurochemical compensation is one form of neuroplasticity (remodeling/ dynamic
              changes) in the nervous system that is a hallmark of the developmental process.
               All of the proposed studies will be conducted in rats of both sexes to
              determine whether the two sexes respond similarly to developmental
              manipulations.
This study will provide new insights into the role of an
              important neurochemical in the maturation of the brain and behavior.  The study
              should also provide insights into how a developing mammal responds behaviorally
              to changes in the neurochemical environment, as well as insights into the types
              of compensations that are made in response to these changes.
