Abstract    :
              This project continues to maintain and develop the Online Ethics Center for
              Engineering & Science (hereafter "the Center") and to expand its use and
              usefulness. In the forty months of its existence the Center has grown rapidly
              into a substantial (over 1,600 pages), and well-organized site. Use of the site
              has increased exponentially. Between December 1997 and December 1998 the number
              of pages accessed each day has grown from a little over 1,500 to over 7,500, or
              nearly a quarter of a million pages per month.  The objectives for the renewal
              period include some that continue or expand existing areas of accomplishment,
              such as:  operational changes to improve response and reliability of the site;
              updates of the bibliography, the indexes, and the keywords, and further linking
              of the glossary to new and existing pages, and the addition of other hypermedia
              enhancements; ongoing response to user requests, comments, and evaluations; new
              cases, essays and commentaries, including those on environmental issues for
              engineers and a greatly expanded collection of research ethics cases; new
              instructional resources, including resources for teachers in middle schools and
              high schools.  They also include new types of contributions: the conduct of Web
              conferences to the site; and the expansion of the Center's capability to
              provide support for larger infrastructure in the area of science and
              engineering ethics, through 1) prototype collaborations that divide the tasks
              of creating and maintaining new web resources among researchers at institutions
              other than Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), and 2) the provision of a
              full mirror of the site on a commercial Internet provider to ensure
              uninterrupted access to the site at all times.  A diverse student team under
              the direction of the present PI, with the advice of a distinguished advisory
              board, carries on the work of the Center.  An evaluation component, that
              includes questionnaires, interviews, and assessments of the material on the
              pages, will be undertaken in the renewal period.
