It
              is proposed to investigate the effect of the carrier gas and its pressure on
              the process of homogeneous nucleation by using a flow diffusion cloud chamber
              (FDCC).  This is an alternative to the thermal diffusion cloud chamber (TDCC),
              also based on mass and heat diffusion, but with additional control on the
              nucleation process and its location in the chamber.  A high pressure (up to 100
              bar) FDCC will be constructed, and critical supersaturating and nucleation
              rates for a series of gases a series of carrier gases (methanol, ethanol, 1-
              and 2-propanol, 1-butanol, and n-nonane in hydrogen, helium, nitrogen and
              argon) will be tested.  A model predicts the location where nucleation occurs. 
               
The effect of carrier gases and their pressure is an important scientific
              open issue of practical relevance in air pollution, and high-pressure
              nucleation processes in chemical industry.
