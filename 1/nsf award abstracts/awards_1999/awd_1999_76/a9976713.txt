The Physics, Chemistry and Mechanical Engineering departments
              and the School of Education at SUNY-Binghamton establish a Masters program in
              materials science with a focus in electronic packaging.  The integrated
              university/industry research and training program includes several teaching
              innovations based upon an industrial team structure, communication and career
              planning workshops, ethics courses and web-based courses.

The overall
              objective of this program, based upon successful efforts in team-based research
              already in place at Binghamton, is to produce versatile graduates who can work
              with people of any vocation.  The diverse elements of this team effort,
              including research, industry, and education professionals, will help prepare
              graduates for the variety of problems they will face in a modern career.
