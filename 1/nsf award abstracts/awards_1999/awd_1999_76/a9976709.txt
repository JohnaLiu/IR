This Major Research Instrumentation award to Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts provides funds to develop and build
              ocean bottom seismometer instruments to conduct research in the structure of
              earth's crust and mantle as well as earthquake dynamics in the marine
              environment.  The award provides funds to build fifty new instruments and
              modify thirty others; together with existing instruments it will provide a pool
              of 95 seismometers suitable for use throughout the world ocean which will be
              operated by WHOI under cooperative agreement (separate from this award) with
              NSF.  The award also provided funds for related shipping containers, computers
              for data retrieval and operations, and other instrumentation to support the
              instruments.  The seismometers will be available to qualified researchers from
              throughout the US academic community.  The project is supported by the Division
              of Ocean Sciences at NSF.  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will provide
              cost-share support for 32.5% of total project costs.
