This three-year award supports US-Swiss collaborative
              research in organic chemistry between Andrew French of Albion College and
              Thomas Wirth of the University of Basel.  The research involves evaluation of
              chiral hypervalent iodine compounds as asymmetric reagents.  The investigators
              propose to synthesize and characterize new iodinane reagents, their
              intermediates, and the product of their reactions with compounds containing
              carbon-carbon double bonds.  NMR, MS and elemental analysis will be applied in
              these studies.

This project initiates a new collaboration with Swiss
              researchers and provides an international research opportunity to an assistant
              professor at a predominantly US undergraduate institution and to his
              undergraduate students.  Students will gain research experiences in organic
              chemistry, including multistep synthesis of chiral nonracemic compounds, and in
              synthetic methodology.  The project takes advantage of Swiss expertise in the
              area of chiral hypervalent iodine compounds.
