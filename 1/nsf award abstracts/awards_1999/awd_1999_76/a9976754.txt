Abstract    :
              9976754

Discrete optimization is one of the most important areas of
              operations research, and deals with the methodology of finding  optimal
              solutions to problems involving variables which must take integer (i.e.
              non-fractional) values.  Its applications occur in  numerous areas of science,
              technology, management, etc., and include problems as diverse as those of
              determining the optimal locations of warehouses, VLSI chip design, airline crew
              scheduling, etc.  The main goal of DO'99 is to provide an overview of the
              current state of the art in the field of discrete optimization.  For this
              purpose, 23 of the most prominent researchers active in this field will provide
              state of the art presentations of various subareas of this discipline.  The
              current project's objective is to make it possible for a larger number of
              junior researchers, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students to participate
              in the meeting and attend the lectures of these world-renowned experts.  At the
              same time, these participants will also have the opportunity to present papers
              about their own research, and to establish contacts both with the senior
              participants and with their peers.  The funds made available through this
              project will be used entirely to provide stipends for participants.
