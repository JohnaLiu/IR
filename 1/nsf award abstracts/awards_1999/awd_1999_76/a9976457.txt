This grant supports theoretical research on a variety of topics
              in modern condensed matter theory.  This includes research on nonequilibrium
              solid-state theory and on density-functional theory (DFT) of solid structures. 
              The Principal Investigator's groundbreaking work on this second topic was
              recognized in 1998 by sharing the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  The first area
              will focus on thermodynamics of quantum systems as well as a non-heuristic
              study of the Landauer approach to electron transport models in nanostructures. 
              The second area will focus on ways to treat realistically the differing
              electron environment in bulk-like versus edge atoms in DFT as well as
              development of methods for including long-range polarization effects in DFT to
              treat asymptotic van der Waals effects.

This grant supports works by one
              of the founders of modern many-body materials theory, and a recipient of the
              1998 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The grant contains research on extending current
              solid-state theory to treat nonequilbrium properties of materials such as
              electron transport in nanostructures.  The grant also supports work in 
              improving computational treatments of current bottlenecks in density-functional
              theory of electronic structure such as the differing electron environments near
              atoms surrounded by many other atoms versus atoms at the surface, and the
              long-standing difficulty in DFT in calculating long-range polarization-based
              forces in materials resulting from van der Waals interactions.
