Abstract    :
              	The planning grant effort is aimed at building a coalition of collaborators for
              submission of a Large Collaborative Project Gender Equity Program proposal (the
              "Project") to NSF in 2000.  The Project's overarching aim is to help and
              encourage girls to become productive contributors to new emerging science and
              technology infrastructures.  	
	The planning process will be overseen by a
              faculty steering committee made up of education experts and female scientists
              (math, engineering, physical sciences).  A graduate student will be hired as
              Project Assistant to help the steering committee make the necessary contacts
              with area school districts, non-profit organizations, industry and universities
              who will collaborate with UC Davis faculty.  Planning will also involve focus
              groups with target audiences, testing of Project components and gathering data
              on existing successful programs.  Finally, the planning period will allow two
              new UC Davis Deans to work with the Project Development Team to integrate the
              Project into the University's long-range research-to-education plans.
