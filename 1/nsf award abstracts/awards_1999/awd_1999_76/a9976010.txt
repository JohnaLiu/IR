Abstract    :
              With this award, The University of Montana will join over 150 other 
research
              universities who are engaged in advanced high performance 
networking, the
              Next Generation Internet initiative, and the consortium of 
Internet2
              universities. The award provides Montana with $350,000, an amount 
they will
              more than match, so that they can establish their advanced 
network link
              through a gigapop in Seattle at the University of Washington. 
These network
              connections are supported by NSF in order to enable science 
and research uses
              at the universities. Montana has a number of strong 
research activities and
              programs related to the biological sciences, 
mining, forestry, land use, and
              management of natural resources. Their 
collaborations with other universities
              in the region and throughout the 
nation, as well as other support from NASA
              and DOE, will be greatly served 
by this new networking facility.
