Abstract    :
                 In 1998, Racquel Aquillon, a representative from Multnomah County working
              with Latina girls at Clara Vista, approached Oregon Museum of Science and
              Industry (OMSI) to request help in creating a program which would address the
              retention of Latina girls who are at the highest risk of dropping out of school
              and who had, in her words, "given up on math and science."
   OMSI is
              interested in furthering its association with the Latina community, in
              addressing issues in math and science specific to young women and in expanding
              its understanding of unique issues facing these communities.
   This proposed
              planning grant seeks funds to:
   o  host three symposia which will inform,
              facilitate discussion, and prepare OMSI staff and community               
              collaborators to effectively plan a program 
   o  prototype recruitment and
              mentorship activities involving Latina girls in third and eighth grades, as
              well        as recruitment and science inquiry training activities for Latina
              preschoolers and their parents, to                 evaluate the feasibility of 
              proposed approaches for a future large collaborative project, and
   o 
              collaborate with community leaders to write one or more large collaborative
              grants for comprehensive           programs to address the recruitment and
              retention of Latina girls in science and technology, including            
              preschool parent/child education, girls science clubs for third through eighth
              grades, camp-in programs        linking professional women scientists to young
              Latina women, camp and class opportunities, special                projects,
              including girls' web design classes, family events, community science fairs
              with Latina girls           (club members) in leadership roles, and peer
              mentorship and volunteer opportunities for Latina girls.
   Three symposia
              would afford OMSI and community collaborators the opportunity to build an
              extensive knowledge of gender equity and Latino community issues.  The
              intention is to use the symposia as a stage for discussions and planning
              sessions around relevant topics, using nationally renowned professionals to
              inform and launch discussions.
   During the course of the planning grant,
              OMSI will work with girls from project OFELIA, a program of OCHA (the Oregon
              council for Latina Advancement) to test and document the feasibility of
              proposed strategies.
