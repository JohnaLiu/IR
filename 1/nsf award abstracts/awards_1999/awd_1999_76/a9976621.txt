This grant continues the support of this well respected PI in
              several aspects of statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics.  The PI has made
              significant contributions to the class of problems involving interplay between
              quenched randomness and thermal and  quantum fluctuations.  The current project
              encompasses research involving the combined effects of randomness and dynamics
              on systems with many degrees of freedom.  One class of problems involves
              nonlinear collective transport, which include dynamics of cracks in solids,
              earthquakes on geological faults, critical current and other breakdown
              phenomena in superconductors, and the motion of interfaces and charge density
              waves in solids.  Systems which exhibit quantum behavior at low temperatures
              are particularly susceptible to randomness and can display exotic properties;
              such phenomena will be studied in both magnetic and electronic systems. 
              Frustration effects in classical systems will also be considered.
 
This
              grant continues work on a broad range of  problems,  related by certain
              underlying mathematical similarities.  One class of problems include the motion
              of geological  faults, dynamics of fracture in solids, dielectric breakdown 
              and properties of distribution of intense current in a superconductor.  In
              another class of problems, there are random quantum magnets, propagation of
              magnetic vortices in  a superconductor etc.  These problems are noted for their
              complexity, novelty and a broad range of applications.
