Abstract    :
              This award will fund a conference entitled "Symbolic Computation, Number Theory,
              Special Functions, Physics and Combinatorics." Computer Algebra (or symbolic
              computation) is an interdisciplinary area between Mathematics and Computer
              Science.  Its research focuses on the development of algorithms for performing
              symbolic manipulations of algebraic objects on computers, and the design of
              programming languages and environments for implementing these algorithms.
              

This conference will focus on the symbolic computation side of computer
              algebra. There are two main aspects: (1) devising algorithms for the symbolic
              computation of objects from Number theory, Special Functions, Physics and
              Combinatorics; and (2) applying these algorithms to discover and/or prove
              results in these areas. The main emphasis of the conference will be Computer
              Algebra and how it relates to the fields of Number Theory, Special Functions,
              Physics and Combinatorics. A subject that is common to all of these fields is
              q-series. We hope to bring together those who do symbolic computation with
              q-series and those that need q-series including workers in Physics and
              Combinatorics. The conference should inform mathematicians and physicists that
              use q-series of the latest developments in the field and especially how
              symbolic computation has aided these developments. It should also inform
              participants of new computer algebra software and algorithms used in the study
              of q-series.
