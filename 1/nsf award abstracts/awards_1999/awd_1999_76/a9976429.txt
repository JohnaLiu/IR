Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102. It provides partial
              support for two years for an OC-3 connection. Applications involve the
              development of a fiber-optic sensor system called the "Artificial Nose
              Project", a high energy physics application, Project MONARC; and locating
              anomalies in large data sets and verification with simulation models. Other
              projects include a humanities digital library, the Perseus Project follow-on,
              microscale reflectance spectrometry of biological thin-film structures and
              multisensor electrochemical analysis on Mars. Collaborating institutions
              include: CERN, California Institute of Technology, Columbia University, West
              Virginia University, University of Arizona, University of Kentucky, Duke
              University; UC - Irvine, Northwestern University, Penn State University, Johns
              Hopkins University, NASA, IBM Watson Research Center in New York, Stanford
              University, and SUNY - Albany.
