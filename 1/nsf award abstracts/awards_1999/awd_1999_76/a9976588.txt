This project will extend the adaptive critic designs in
              neural networks to the control of distributed parameter systems.  One of the
              strengths of the adaptive critic design is that it presents a unified learning
              based approach regardless of the problem structure-whether it is linear or
              nonlinear.  This research has two major objectives: the first is to develop two
              adaptive critic designs for the control of distributed parameter systems. The
              first design based on approximate dynamic programming outputs optimal return
              function and the derivatives of the cost with respect to the system states. The
              second critic design outputs the Hamiltonian and its derivatives with respect
              to the states and control.  The second major objective is to analyze
              performance of these neuro-controllers in controlling parabolic (and
              hyperbolic) and elliptic systems. These types of systems represent distributed
              	parameter control problems in MEMS, active flow control, and active vibration
              control, ocean 	mining for minerals, power systems, etc.  We will consider
              regulator problems AND finite horizon 	problems. The stability and convergence
              of the adaptive critic designs will form part of the study.  He plans
              investigate the effects of imperfect modeling which is a crucial issue in any
              controller synthesis for distributed parameter systems.  The significance of
              this research lies in the fact that it  combines the human problem solving
              (brain like intelligence) philosophy embedded in the adaptive critic design
              with classical mathematics to solve 	some very important and current complex
              problems in Engineering.
