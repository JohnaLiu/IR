Abstract    :
              
The proposal describes a three-year program to investigate the dynamics of
              microwave and millimeter wave generations in two-section gain-coupled DFB
              lasers, and their potential applications in broadband wireless and high-speed
              optical time-division multiplexing systems. Specific goals are: (1) to develop
              the technology for optical generation of microwave/millimeter wave signal using
              two-section gain-coupled DFB lasers, (2) to design and demonstrate fiber-optic
              links using the above source for future broad band wireless networks, and (3)
              to demonstrate high-speed (up to 160 Gb/s) OTDM sources employing the
              gain-coupled DFB lasers.
