Abstract    :
                 Planning for Project EFFECT II will build a coalition of university faculty
              and administrators, American Indian Tribal leaders, and high school teachers
              and administrators with a common vision and long-term commitment to: 
              increasing the number of women, Native Americans, and other underrepresented
              groups in SMET, and changing the climate in SMET.  The process will culminate
              in the collaborative planning and writing of a Large Collaborative Project
              proposal in 2000.
   In June 1997, Washington State University (WSU) was
              awarded a NSF Implementation and Development Project grant, Equation For Future
              Equity in Curriculum and Technology (Project EFFECT), through the Program for
              Women and Girls.  Planning for EFFECT II is a concerted effort to expand the
              impact of Project EFFECT to the immediate region within Washington and Idaho. 
              Expansion to other institutions and target populations requires a large
              collaborative effort between WSU, other postsecondary institutions, secondary
              institutions, and Native American Tribes.  This Planning Grant provides the
              financial support to bring together representatives for two planning
              meetings.
