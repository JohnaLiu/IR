	This project investigates the extent of foraging among a
              forest people of Tanzania about whom little is known.  The group to be studied,
              the Western Hadza, live in a remote area not much connected to the central
              government or to the tourist influences which are affecting the Hadza who live
              to the East.  Once hunting and gathering is abandoned, one can continue to
              study the psychology of foragers, so long as the people being studied once
              foraged and maintain the same attitudes, beliefs and preferences.  By studying
              active foragers, the researcher, a cultural anthropologist from Harvard
              University, can use quantitative observational methods to learn things about
              the hunting and gathering niche that can not be learned any other way.  He will
              conduct all day and half day focal follows of men hunting, recording prey
              encounter and capture rates.  He will weigh food acquired before it is
              distributed, and again before the individual eats the remaining share, and will
              note the pattern of distribution.  In this three-month pilot research the
              investigator will also conduct a census.  Through research on relatively simple
              economies such as this we can better understand the selection pressures
              responsible for shaping human behavior.  This pilot study will assess the
              prospects for future research with this group.
