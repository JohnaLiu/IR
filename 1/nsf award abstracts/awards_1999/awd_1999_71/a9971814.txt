Abstract    :
              9971814

The objective of the proposed research is to improve the ability of
              researchers, instructors, and other users of statistical methodology to apply
              statistical methods in new problem areas.  The proposed research is concerned
              in particular with the exploration and development of new principles for the
              design of statistical software to take advantage of modern computing power. 
              This work explores the use of compilation and multi-threading in statistical
              computing.  It examines the advantages of different language forms, including
              graphical languages, for expressing statistical ideas. Principles for
              developing effective systems for dynamic graphical explorations are also
              explored.

              concerned in particular with the exploration and development of new principles
              for the design of statistical software to take advantage of modern computing
              power.  This work examines how to build on new developments in computer science
              to allow statistical data analysis to take full advantages of the speed and
              graphics capabilities made available by advances in computer hardware.  The
              insights and methods developed in this research will lead to improvements in
              the practice and the teaching of statistical ideas within mathematics,
              engineering, and other areas of technological education.
