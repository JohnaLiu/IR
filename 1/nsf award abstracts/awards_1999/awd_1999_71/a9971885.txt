The goal of this project is to survey the caddisfly,
              or Trichoptera, fauna of southeastern Brazil, including the states of Sao
              Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Esperito Santo, and Minas Gerais.  Tricoptera comprise
              the largest order of aquatic insects and occur in rivers, streams, and lakes
              around the world.  They are well known because of the remarkable cases and nets
              built by the aquatic larvae.  Larvae are integral components of various
              ecological processes in aquatic systems, and because they vary tremendously in
              their susceptibility to various pollutants, they are widely used as key species
              in water quality programs employing biomonitoring techniques.  The inventory
              area encompasses the most densely populated part of Brazil where the streams
              have been historically subjected to a wide range of environmental abuses,
              including deforestation, siltation, contamination from industry, impoundment,
              runoff, and by acid rain.  The focus of the survey will be on adult
              caddisflies, because the taxonomy of the species based on this stage in the
              life history, but emphasis will also be given to larval taxonomy.
