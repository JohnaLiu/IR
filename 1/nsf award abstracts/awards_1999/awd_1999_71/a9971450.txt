Abstract    :
              The adequate numerical treatment of nonlinear phenomena governed
by partial
              differential
equations with several
disparate scales is a formidable
              computational challenge. Modern
algorithms should be able to resolve fine
              scales for certain physical
quantities without overresolving others, thereby
              optimizing the
computational effort and making realistic 3d simulations
              feasible.
Phase transitions in materials science, epitaxial growth,
viscous
              incompressible fluids, and chemotaxis
are typical yet quite distinct examples.
              
The goal of this project is to design, test, and
analyze reliable and
              efficient adaptive finite element methods 
for such problems, with
              
space-time error control and based on
refinement/coarsening mesh
              modification.
This project builds
upon our novel theory for a
              posteriori
error estimation of evolution problems; in fact it extends and
              
enhances the prior NSF Grant
DMS-9623394. It blends quite delicate
              analytical and computational 
issues, and applies them to free boundary
              problems, constrained
problems, and advection-diffusion equations.

This
              project has strong connections with areas of strategic interest
such as
              Materials Science, Micro Electronics and High-Performance
Computing, in that
              it addresses central issues to all of them
such as the development of reliable
              and 
efficient algorithms. 
This is a collaborative project involving a
              number of scientists
in the US and abroad, as well as several students. 
A
              substantial effort is devoted to education
and human resource development.
