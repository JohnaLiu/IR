This research deals with investigations into the
              properties of  strongly correlated Fermi-liquids and non-Fermi Liquid
              Materials.  There are two broad objectives.  The first is to measure the
              single-particle electronic structure of selected correlated electron materials
              while the second attempts to construct a relation between the novel ground
              state properties and the underlying electronic structure.  These general goals
              will be pursued specifically on (A) the elucidation of non-Fermi-liquid (NFL)
              behavior in 1) novel low dimensional materials and 2) in certain uranium
              materials, as well as (B) the study of the interplay between single-ion and
              lattice correlations in 1) the same uranium materials and 2) in 4f electron
              hexaboride alloys which manifest mixed valence and Kondo behavior.
              Photoemission spectroscopy, inverse photoemission spectroscopy as well as angle
              resolved photoemission spectroscopy and resonant photoemission spectroscopy
              will be the primary experimental techniques used.  This research will engage
              graduate students as well as post doctoral research associates in one of the
              forefront areas of contemporary condensed matter physics .

This research
              deals with some important aspects of the behavior of electrons in metals and
              metal compounds, the understanding of which is needed to make progress in the
              direction of improved technology.  Graduate students and postdoctoral research
              associates will participate in this research.  They will thereby receive
              excellent training in an important area of condensed matter physics and  thus
              will be prepared to enter the technological mainstream which will define the
              scientific and technological directions during the next few decades of the 21st
              Century.
