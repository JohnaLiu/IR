ABSTRACT


This project
              concerns the transport of particles, sound and magnetic
fields in turbulent
              flows.  This study seeks new, fundamental
understanding of the the effect of
              the multiscaled, long-range
correlated random flows on large scale transport. 
              Using the ideas of
sampling drift, eddy diffusivity, variational principles 
              and other
methods we show that non-Markovian transport, such as
              fractional
Brownian motions, arises in certain random flows with
              long-range
correlations, and it stands as an alternative macro-transport model
              to
Markovian transport, such as Brownian motion.  For wave transport,
              we
propose a phase-space approach by means of the Wigner transform.  We
show
              that a middle range of sound frequencies couples with the flow
field: they
              convert into each other through mutual scattering and
stretching.  Transport
              of waves at long times can be described by
radiative transfer
              equations.

Transport in fluid flows is ubiquitous.  Transport of particles
              and
waves is among the most important mechanisms affecting environment
              or
global change; it is also a fundamental process in chemical
              engineering
and materials processing. Natural or engineering flows are
              very
complicated due to primarily the presence of phenomena of many
different
              length scales. We study these multiple-scale phenomena for a
standard model by
              a rigorous, novel approach.  We introduce a new
framework, concepts and
              methods which will be very useful for
understanding transport in general
              fluids with multiple scales.
