Abstract    :
                   The investigator studies problems of wave propagation in
complex media,
              using both analytical and numerical techniques.
Long range propagation of
              seismic and other waves in domains that
involve both external boundaries and
              sharp interfaces between
random media with different characteristics are
              studied.  The
correct boundary and interface conditions are analyzed from
              first
principles (wave equations) for smooth and random interfaces.
They are
              used to derive the interface conditions in the diffusion
approximation that is
              more tractable for numerical simulations.
Analytical and numerical methods for
              the analysis of the matrix
valued radiative transport equations for polarized
              waves are
developed.  Effects of inhomogeneous turbulent flows on
              acoustic
wave propagation and in some other problems (front propagation
              in
combustion problems) are also addressed.
     Wave propagation is one of
              the most fundamental physical
processes.  Many physical applications require
              consideration of
waves in highly inhomogeneous media.  These include such
              basic
phenomena as acoustic wave propagation in the atmosphere, seismic
waves
              in the Earth, and many others.  Direct application of wave
equations to such
              problems is beyond reach of even the fast
computers available today.  The
              radiative transport theory is a
valuable approximation that describes energy
              propagation of waves
in complex media with rapid fluctuations of the
              material
properties.  One of the most promising applications is in
              seismic
wave propagation, where this theory has been successfully applied
in
              the last ten years, in particular to model propagation of
disturbances caused
              by earthquakes.
