Turbulent Transport by
              Waves

ABSTRACT

The basic problem considered in this proposal is the
              Transport of
a Passive Scalar in a prescribed velocity field which is 
a
              superposition of waves. The spreading of an oil spill on the ocean 
surface
              can serve as an example. The objective is 
to derive an equation for the
              averaged evolution of the passive
scalar in the ensemble of random waves. The
              analysis of this
basic problem is used for the investigation of Wave
              Turbulence 
(dynamics of a system of random waves weakly interacting with
              each
other). 
The proposal contains also the description of two related
              projects 
about systems with Strong Nonlinearity: Rayleigh-Taylor Instability
              
and Materials with Non-Monotone Stress-Strain Relation.


In practical
              terms the problem of Turbulent Transport by
Waves can be put like this.
              Suppose oil is spilled in the ocean. Ocean
waves have a profound effect on the
              evolution of this spill.
The first goal of the proposal is to derive an
              equation for the
drift and spreading of the spill. The same mathematical
              problem
arises in other problems of the ENVIRONMENT: the
spreading of
              pollutants in the atmosphere or the motion of
phytoplankton in the ocean. We
              also apply the problem of
Turbulent Transport by Waves for the investigation
              of Turbulence
of Waves, such as ocean waves, or sound waves, or
              planetary
waves, which govern the weather. All these problems are
              important
for the understanding of the ENVIRONMENT and GLOBAL CHANGE.
Two
              related projects about systems with Strong Nonlinearity 
are included in the
              proposal as well: (1) the so called
Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which is
              crucial for the NUCLEAR FUSION
(with inertial confinement); (2) the dynamics
              of solids with
non-monotone stress-strain relation (stretching of such a
              solid
can decrease the resisting force). The later could lead to
developing
              of MATERIALS capable of withstanding strong repeated
perturbations. Power
              plants in seismic regions or armor can serve
as examples.
