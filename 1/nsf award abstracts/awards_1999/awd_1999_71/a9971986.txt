Abstract    :
                   The investigator studies three classes of problems related
to fluid and
              geophysical fluid dynamics.  The first class of
problems involves connections
              between the Navier-Stokes equations
of incompressible fluids and conventional
              turbulence theory.  The
investigator studies links between the estimates of
              energy
dissipation rate of three-dimensional boundary-driven flows based
on
              the Navier-Stokes equations and Kolmogorov's heuristic
estimate of energy
              dissipation rate for turbulent flows, and
connections between the asymptotic
              degrees of freedom predicted
by the Navier-Stokes equations (either as the
              fractal dimension
of the global or exponential attractor, or as the number
              of
determining modes, nodes or volume of the system) and those
              from
conventional turbulence theory in combination with the
              heuristic
Landau-Lifschitz argument.  The second class of problems
              is
boundary layer behavior associated with incompressible viscous
fluids
              whose dynamics are governed by the Navier-Stokes
equations.  Both the case
              with non-permeable boundary and the case
with permeable boundary are studied. 
              Results are checked via
numerical simulation and laboratory data.  Some
              relevant efficient
numerical algorithms are developed as well.  The third clas
              of
problems is related to geophysical flows, emphasizing emergence
and
              persistence of large scale coherent structures based on the
barotropic
              quasi-geostrophic model.  Three prototype problems are
studied.  The first is
              a selective decay problem for geophysical
flows that predicts the emergence of
              Rossby waves directly from
the dynamic equations.  The second is a spin-up
              problem with
random forcing of small scale positive vortices.  The third
              is
the barotropic quasi-geostrophic equations on the sphere.
     Fluids are
              indispensable to our life.  They range from the
air we breathe and water we
              drink to oceans and atmosphere that
cover the surface of our the earth.  Study
              of the motion of these
fluids is crucial to us.  At this stage full resolution
              of the
complete dynamic equations lies beyond the capability of the
              most
powerful computing system available today.  Hence approximation
methods
              (both numerical and asymptotic) are needed to provide
qualitative and
              quantitative results on the behavior of the
fluids for simplified but
              prototypical situations.  The problems
proposed here are prototypical and
              understanding them will
facilitate our understanding of fundamental concepts
              related to
fluid and geophysical fluid dynamics.  Study of these
              typical
examples will further our understanding of more realistic
              and
sophisticated problems that are important in many
              engineering
applications (such as wing design or turbulent combustion)
              as
well as in weather prediction, climatology and
              environmental
phenomena.
