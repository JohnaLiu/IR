The
              main goal of the proposal is to apply methods of
noncommutative geometry and
              supergeometry to the mathematical
problems arising in theoretical physics.
              These problems have also
intrinsic mathematical value; they will be treated
              rigorously.
Many of the projects listed in the proposal are related to
              Yang-
Mills theory ( in particular, supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory)
on
              noncommutative spaces and to duality in this theory. The PI is
planning to
              exploit the relation between Morita equivalence and
duality discovered in his
              recent papers with the goal to
understand dualities in gauge theories, string
              theory and
M-theory and to give rigorous treatment of these dualities. 
              It
was shown in recent paper by A. Connes, M. Douglas and A.Schwarz
that
              noncommutative tori arise naturally in the problem of
compactification of
              M-theory ( in Matrix formulation of this
theory).  The PI intends to study
              noncommutative deformations of
other Poisson manifolds and compactifications
              of M-theory on
non-flat noncommutative spaces.  Other projects are related
              to
applications of supergeometry to various problems of quantum
field theory,
              including general problem of quantization of gauge
theories and topological
              quantum field theory.

For several years superstring theory was considered as
              a
candidate for a theory describing all interactions that exist in
the
              Nature.  Now we know that superstring theory is not complete;
it should be
              extended to a more general theory, containing not
only strings, but also their
              multidimensional analogs
(branes).This general theory was named M-theory; it
              was
conjectured that M-theory can be formulated as a matrix model (so
called
              M(atrix) theory). It was shown recently by PI and by other
scholars that the
              methods of noncommutative geometry are very
useful in the analysis of
              M-theory, especially in M(atrix)
formulation of this theory. The PI is
              planning to work further in
this direction; in partucular, he studies the
              energy spectrum and
dualities in the framework of noncommutative geometry.
