Tellurium (Te) has a wide range of abundant stable isotopes. 
              Three different types of structure are thought to be active in these nuclei:
              collective, two-particle, and particle-hole excitations known as intruders. 
              Because there are seven stable even-even Te nuclei, one can study the evolution
              of these excitation modes over a wide range in neutron number.  Emphasis
              centers on understanding the interplay between particle and collective features
              and on the aspects of the nuclear forces that determine the relative
              importance.  In the tellurium nuclei several models are now able to reproduce
              the level scheme, however level lifetimes and transition rates are needed to
              further examine the detailed components of the wavefunctions.  Excited levels
              in Te isotopes below 3.3 MeV will be studied at the University of Kentucky
              Nuclear Structure Laboratory utilizing inelastic neutron scattering techniques.
               Electromagnetic transition rates, multipole mixing and branching ratios, and
              level spins and parities will be deduced from measured gamma-ray excitation
              functions, gamma-gamma coincidences, angular distributions, and Doppler shifts.
