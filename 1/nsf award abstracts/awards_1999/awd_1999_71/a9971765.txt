This award will support participants at the Workshop on
              
Integrating Integrability into Mathematics and Science to be 
held at the
              University of Arizona from October 29-31, 1999.  
Over the last 30 years the
              modern theory of integrable 
systems has proved to be a strongly effective
              conduit for 
transferring models and ideas from physics and applied
              
mathematics to core mathematics and vice versa.  This is 
evidenced by
              recent developments in inverse spectral theory, 
geometry of field theories,
              statistical mechanics, dynamical 
systems, coherent structures in nonlinear
              phenomena, and 
weak turbulence.  The integration of new methods from
              
integrable systems theory into each of these disciplines has 
been rapid
              even in those areas where it has had a traditional 
presence. The purpose of
              the meeting will be to gain a broader 
perspective on the use of integrable
              systems theory across 
these disciplines and to examine parallel developments
              as well 
as ways in which ideas from one field could be used in 
another. 
              The workshop would bring together researchers who 
work at the heart of these
              developments to address issues that 
transcend their specific disciplines. 
              The talks will emphasize 
ways in which ideas and methods from integrable
              systems 
theory will be relevant to mainstream developments in 
mathematics
              and science.
