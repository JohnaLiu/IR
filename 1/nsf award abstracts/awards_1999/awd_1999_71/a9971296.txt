Abstract: Our main effort will go
              into using the methods of controlled surgery theory to study of the geometric
              properties of the exotic homology manifolds discovered by Bryant, Mio,
              Weinberger, and the author. The most pressing questions in this area concern
              the existence of exotic homology manifolds which are homogeneous and the
              existence of exotic homology manifolds which have contractible universal
              covers. Construction of an exotic homogeneous homology manifold would give a
              counterexample to the well-known Bing-Borsuk conjecture, while an exotic
              aspherical homology manifold would give a counterexample to either the integral
              Novikov conjecture or the well-known conjecture that every Poincare duality
              group is the fundamental group of some aspherical manifold.

We also plan to
              use methods from controlled topology to study the Gromov-Lawson conjecture and
              to study the classification of high-dimensional wild topological embeddings in
              codimension two.
