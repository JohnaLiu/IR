Abstract: In the current
              project, the Principal Investigator will continue his
study of the topological
              structures on which various interesting
classes of groups can act.  In
              particular, the PI will show how
various types of Artin groups, Coxeter
              groups, braid groups, Burnside
groups, and pure symmetric automorphism groups
              can be made to act on
spaces constructed to have one or more additional
              properties.  The
ability to construct such spaces has long been a goal of
              geometric
group theorists.  Since many of these groups arise as the
              fundamental
groups of configuration spaces the pattern underlying much of
              the
proposed work can be summarized as follows: a topologically defined
space
              whose fundamental group is of interest is made to act on a
piecewise Euclidean
              cell complex whose structure is understood well
enough to have computational
              comsequences for the group involved.  The
aim of this project is to increase
              the number and variety of groups to
which thiss type of procedure can be
              applied.

This type of project continues the recent emphasis within
              geometric
group theory on the practical, computational aspects of
              mathematics.
The results under consideration will not merely show the
              existence of
various objects, but will provide algorithms for their
              construction
and bounds of the complexity of the procedures involved.  Thus
              all of
the work described can be implemented as a computer software
              package
which performs these types of computations.  This explicit emphasis
              on
the algorithms and their complexity makes geometric group theory a
close
              relative of theoretical computer science and of the real world
applications of
              these techniques.
