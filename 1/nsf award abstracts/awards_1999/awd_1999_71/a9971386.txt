Abstract    :
              

Under previous NSF grants (Salamo, NSF-EPSCoR; Segev, ECS-9632964,
              Christodoulidas, RIA), the co-PIs have pioneered and contributed significantly
              in the theoretical understanding and experimental observations of spatial
              solitons including the incoherent solitons. This proposal is an attempt to
              extend their work and make use of the spatial soliton for efficient nonlinear
              frequency conversion in an soliton-induced waveguide using broad area laser
              sources.
