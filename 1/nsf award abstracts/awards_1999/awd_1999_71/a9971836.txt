The principal investigator and three to four undergraduate
              students will carry out the experimental nuclear physics research program of
              the University of Michigan, Dearborn.  One major thrust of the program will be
              the investigation of radioactive nuclear beams produced at the NSCL by
              employing three different techniques.  First, differential cross sections for
              the elastic scattering of the beams from stable nuclei will be measured over
              side angular ranges.  The optical model and folding model analyses of the data
              will provide information of the structure and interaction properties of these
              unstable nuclei.  Second, the outermost nucleon will be knocked out by a
              proton, and the angular and energy distributions of both the proton and
              ejectile will be measured.  From the DWIA analyses of the data, momentum
              distributions, binding energies, angular momenta and core-nucleon correlations
              will be obtained.  Third, measurement of reaction cross sections will identify
              halo characteristics and details of nuclear and electromagnetic dissociations. 
              The overall goal is to derive anomalous characteristics peculiar to radioactive
              nuclei.  Another major thrust will be the study of heavy ion reactions to
              obtain more insight into the reaction mechanism and to derive parameters that
              will contribute towards the determination of the nuclear equation of state.  In
              particular emissions from non-compact geometry (with low-density interior) and
              radial flow will be examined.
