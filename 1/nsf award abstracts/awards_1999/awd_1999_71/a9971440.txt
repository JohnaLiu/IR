Abstract: The
              principal investigator will investigate the topology of smooth 4-manifolds.  By
              decomposing smooth manifolds into complex pieces, he will use the techniques of
              complex and symplectic manifolds to understand the restriction this
              decomposition imposes on the topology of smooth 4-manifolds.  The principal
              investigator hopes to apply the techniques from the solution of the
              `Scharlemann problem' and Fintushel-Stern constructions to the problem of
              constructing 4-dimensional fake s-cobordisms, and to the problem of
              constructing a fake copy of `three-sphere crossed with circle'. He would like
              to study topology of Horikawa surfaces and hopes to give affirmative answers to
              various branched covering conjectures.

The principal investigator intends to
              study generalized 4-dimensional spaces (4-manifolds); he hopes to find new
              ones. These spaces arise naturally in physics: relativity (space-time) and
              quantum field theories.  Recently there have been exciting developments about
              the structure of these spaces coming from the ideas of physics, but we still
              don't know if certain basic exotic 4-manifolds could exist. If they exist they
              will be basic building blocks of the known ones. We would like to investigate
              possible constructions which could give their existence.
