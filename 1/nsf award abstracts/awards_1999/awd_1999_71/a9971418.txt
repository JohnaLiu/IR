Award:  DMS-9971418
Principal Investigator:  Peter Li

In this
              project, the principal investigator proposes to study
various analytical
              aspects of a complete manifold in relation to
its geometrical structure.  In
              particular, he proposes to
understand the space of polynomial growth harmonic
              functions on a
general class of manifolds that includes manifolds
              with
non-negative Ricci curvature and also minimal submanifolds of
Euclidean
              space which has Euclidean volume growth.  He also
proposes to understand the
              structure of the image set of harmonic
maps and it implications to the
              underlining geometric,
topological, and complex structures.  Finally, he
              proposes to
investigate the impact of the validity of a global mean
              value
inequality with sufficiently small mean value constant.

The study of
              geometric-analytical structure is a fundamental and
important part in the
              development of mathematics.  It also has
direct implications to many branches
              of sciences and engineering,
such as, general relativity, robotics, material
              science, and
computer graphics.
