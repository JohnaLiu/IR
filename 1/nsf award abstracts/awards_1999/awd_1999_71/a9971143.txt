This project will characterize and quantifiy intermolecular
              forces in liquid crystals through carefully constructed experiments and
              associated modeling of the experimental findings.  The aim is to simply and
              realistically describe the orientational and conformational biases operative in
              mesophases so that molecular architectures can be tailored to amplify
              desireable properties.  Experiments are designed to separate orientational
              ordering into its primary components - steric and electrostatic interactions -
              to enable the prediction of properties of liquid crystals.  Nuclear magnetic
              resonance will be used to study solute-liquid crystal solvent pairs; the
              synthesis and evaluation of new liquid structures based on heterocyclic
              thiophene and oxadiazole rings will be delineated to highlight the role of
              electrostatic interactions in nonlinear "banana-" or "boomerang-shaped"
              mesogens.  New electro-optic properties may be exhibited by smectic phases of
              these materials, and the new liquid crystals may be used to test the
              "indigenous polarity" model of the origins of spontaneous polarization in
              ferroelectric liquid crystals.

Understanding the properties of new
              classes of liquid crystals in terms of their molecular structural features will
              enable the rational design of new maesogens that can be optimized for specific
              applications such as high contrast ratios, rapid switching, and high
              spontaneous polarization useful for improving a range of devices that include
              flat-panel displays.
