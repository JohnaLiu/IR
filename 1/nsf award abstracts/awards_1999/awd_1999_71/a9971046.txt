Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT
This research is toward developing mathematical models for
              material
behavior at a phenomenological level. The goal is a
              continuum-mechanical
framework for the study of materials that provides a
              basis for general
theories and leads to relevant problems. Proposed are
              studies involving
incoherent phase transitions, dislocations in the presence
              of atomic
diffusion, and grain-boundary motion.

The growing alliance of
              nonlinear continuum mechanics and analysis has
led to significant advances in
              the understanding of materials; important
consequences are new ways of
              understanding defects and microstructures
and the ability to predict
              macroscopic properties as well as detailed
behavior at the microscopic level.
              This project is meant to continue
this thrust.
