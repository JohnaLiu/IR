The work in symplectic geometry on which this proposal focuses
              is
divided roughly into two overlapping areas.  The first set of
problems is
              focused on developing a better understanding of
symplectic manifolds, and in
              particular on the topology and
geometry of symplectic manifolds equipped with
              group actions.
The past five years have seen a significant increase of the
              role
of the symplectic category in topology and geometry, as well as a
better
              understanding of the analogies and differences between
symplectic geometry and
              Kahler geometry.  In this proposal we
propose to develop tools for the study
              of Hamiltonian and
symplectic group actions, as well as of the topology and
              geometry
of symplectic quotients.  The second set of problems we
              are
concerned with is the application of ideas from symplectic
geometry to
              problems arising in other areas of mathematics and
mathematical physics. 
              These problems are largely motivated by
the applications of quantum field
              theory to geometry and
topology, many of which either involve symplectic
              geometry
directly or else involve areas where symplectic geometry can help
to
              provide a better view of the geometrical structure that must
underlie these
              still-mysterious methods arising from physics.

The areas of mathematics
              involved---symplectic geometry and
mathematical physics---are areas which have
              their historical
origins in the physical sciences.  As such, they have had a
              long
record of gaining insight from problems arising in the natural
sciences,
              as well as of making significant contributions to
applied problems.  This
              record is one attained mostly by the
whole field over decades, rather than by
              individual contributions
over the short term.  But to the extent that a long
              and consistent
past record can be used as an indication of the future, there
              are
excellent prospects that current work in these areas of core
mathematics
              will provide indispensible building blocks for
scientific and technological
              advances in the decades to come.
