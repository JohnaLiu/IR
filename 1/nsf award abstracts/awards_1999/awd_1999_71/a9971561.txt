Abstract: The
              main theme of this project is to understand the topology of hyperbolic knots or
              links in 3-manifolds and its variation under Dehn surgery through studying the
              SL(2,C)-character varieties associated to the knot or link complements.
              Applications to exceptional Dehn surgery,especially to the property P
              conjecture and the cabling conjecture will be explored. It is well known that
              all closed orientable 3-manifolds are interelated topologically through Dehn
              surgery on knots and links. This relation is nicely and deeply encoded
              algebraically in the SL(2,C)-character varieties of the involved knot or link
              complements. Studying the connections between the topology of 3-manifolds and
              their character varieties has been very successful in understanding 3-manifolds
              and their change under Dehn surgery. This project is a continuation of this
              line of investigation, with an eye to possible solutions of some outstanding
              conjectures.

3-manifold topology is a branch of mathematics in which we
              study and classify certain global structures of "universes" (called 3-manifolds
              by mathematicians). It is natural and compelling for human beings to understand
              3-manifolds because we believe we live in one of them. Besides being
              interesting and beautiful in its own right, 3-manifold topology has profound
              connections and interactions with other branches of mathematics, and also with
              physics, chemistry, biology and computer science. It is one of most active and
              fertile research fields in modern mathematics. The current project aims at
              solving several fundamental problems in 3-manifold topology.
