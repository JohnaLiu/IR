A complex manifold X is said to be holomorphically convex if,
              for
every infinite subset S without limit points in X, there is a
holomorphic
              function f on X which is unbounded on S.  The
principal investigator plans to
              work on holomorphic convexity
properties of coverings of projective varieties.
               He also plans
to work on problems concerning Lefschetz type theorems and
              the
structure of complete Kahler manifolds which have been partly
motivated
              by the study of covering spaces.  He proposes to apply
recent advances in the
              theory of singular metrics to these
problems.

Holomorphic functions on
              regions in the complex number plane (or
on more general complex spaces) are
              the natural analogues of
differentiable functions on the real number line
              from
differential calculus.  A very broad, deep, and old problem is
              to
determine how the geometric structure of a (complex) space is
related to
              its holomorphic structure.  This question has
motivated a large amount of work
              in mathematics and has itself
been motivated by work in many fields (for
              example, physics).
Kahler manifolds are spaces in which the
              (infinitesimal)
holomorphic structure is connected with the
              (infinitesimal)
geometric structure in a natural way.  Holomorphic convexity
              is
an analogue of geometric convexity (for example, a region in the
plane is
              geometrically convex if any line segment connecting two
points in the region
              lies entirely within the region).  It has
been known for forty years that, for
              a noncompact complex
manifold, holomorphic convexity is a strong condition
              which tells
one a great deal about the holomorphic structure.  Thus a
              natural
question in the context of the broader problem mentioned above
              is
when is a Kahler manifold holomorphically convex?
