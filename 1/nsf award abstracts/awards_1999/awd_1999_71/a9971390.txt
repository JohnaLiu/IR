Price
Dr. Price proposes to perform the following tasks:
1.
              Construction and deployment of two digital strings in conjunction with LBL
2.
              Characterize optical properties of ice at various locations at the South Pole
              and compare the measurements with predictions
3. Search for neutrinos from
              data collected with existing and new strings
4. Investigate radar tomography
              as a method for measuring the precise position of string ends
5. Explore ways
              to identify the three types of neutrinos through their shower development
