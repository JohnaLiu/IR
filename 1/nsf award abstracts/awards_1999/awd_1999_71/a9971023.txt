     The 26th Conference on Stochastic Processes and their
              Applications will be held in Beijing, China, from June 14-28, 1999. This
              conference provides a valuable opportunity for US researchers to interact with
              prominent researchers from other countries. This award will provide travel
              support for US participants.  At least half of the funds will be used to
              provide support for junior researchers.
