Abstract    :
              The Boolean Satisfiability problem (SAT) lies at the core of many
computational
              tasks in the field of design automation. While SAT has the
distinction of
              being the first member of the NP-complete class, recent
advances in search
              pruning algorithms have yielded a crop of powerful SAT
solvers capable of
              tackling problems involving tens of thousands of
variables and millions of
              constraints. This project is exploring the
application of the particularly
              effective GRASP SAT engine to exactly model
and solve a class of physical
              design problems that have traditionally been
attacked heuristically.
              Specifically, research activities being carried out
under this grant include:
              1) layout optimization of field-programmable gate
arrays (FPGAs) including
              ways for modeling signal path route patterns,
modeling and imposition of
              timing requirements, and quick determination and
distillation of useful
              diagnostic information in cases of unroutability,
and 2) custom-quality
              transistor-level cell synthesis through better
estimation of routing area
              during transistor micro-placement, simultaneous
placement and routing, and
              exploration of more degrees of freedom in both
placement and routing. A
              detailed FPGA routing tool developed in this
project is being widely
              distributed.
