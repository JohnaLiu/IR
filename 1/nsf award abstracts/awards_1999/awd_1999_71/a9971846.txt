Abstract    :
              Mhaskar will continue his investigations on the complexity problem in
the
              theory of neural networks and construction of multiscales based on
orthogonal
              polynomial coefficients as well as samples of the target
functions. Variations
              of such classical methods from approximation
theory as summability methods and
               polynomial inequalities will be
developed to provide a unified theory of
              these apparently diverse areas.
The work will be applied to the numerical
              construction of orthogonal
polynomials, approximation on the sphere using
              scattered data, and the
theory of system identification.

Although
              approximation theory is a classical area of mathematics, active
for more than
              a hundred years, technological progress in the areas of
neural networks and
              wavelets has given rise to many new possibilities
for applications of
              approximation theory. Neural networks and wavelets
are both useful in high
              speed parallel computing, and naturally involve
the approximation of
              functions. Approximation theory techniques used
with neural networks have
              produced dramatically better results in
certain applications to array antenna
              technology, pattern recognition,
and financial time series prediction.
