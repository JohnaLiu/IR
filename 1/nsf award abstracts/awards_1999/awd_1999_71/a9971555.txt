Abstract: The proposer plans to
              investigate purely algebraic analogs of the theory
of the characteristic
              submanifold of a Haken 3-manifold. Some results in
this direction have already
              been obtained by several authors but their
uniqueness results are much weaker
              than that in the 3-manifold context. It
is expected that such results should
              also yield new understanding of the
purely topological theory of 3-manifolds.
              

  The universe appears to be 3-dimensional and it is a very
              interesting
question to understand its shape. There is an abstract theory of
              spaces
called 3-manifolds which attempts to describe all the possibilities
              for
the shape of such a space. While this theory is not complete, there is
              a
great deal known. In particular, many (and perhaps all) such spaces can
              be
decomposed into simple geometric pieces in a natural way. In
              this
proposal, it is planned to investigate further the properties of
              this
decomposition into geometric pieces.
