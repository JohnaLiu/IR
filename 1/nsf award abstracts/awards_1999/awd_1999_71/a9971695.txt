Most of what is known about the assemblages of fungi and
              their associated beeltes in particular types of terrestrial ecosystems and the
              fundamental ecological roles that they play in these ecosystems has been
              derived from studies carried out in temperate regions of the world.  Relatively
              little is konwn about the biodiversity and ecology of these two groups of
              organisms in cold-dominated, high-latitude regions of the world.  The objective
              of the proposed research is to carry out the first intensive study of the fungi
              and beetles associated with various habitats on Campbell Island, a small
              oceanic island located approximately 700 km south of the New Zealand mainland. 
              Primary emphasis will be directed towards assessing patterns of distribution,
              relative abundance, host/substrate associations and ecological roles for
              mycophagous beetles and four major taxonomic groups of terrestrial fungi. 
              Secondary emphasis will be placed on lichenized fungi and the various groups of
              aquatic fungi found in the small streams and lakes that occur on the island. 
              Data obtained for the assemblages of fungi and beetles on Campbell Island will
              be compared with similar data that already exist for two other islands
              (Macquarie Island and South Georgia Island) in the south polar region and
              comparable areas of the north polar region, including the Alaskan Aleutian
              Islands.
