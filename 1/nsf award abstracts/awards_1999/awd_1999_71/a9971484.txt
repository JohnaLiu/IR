The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.
This award will support a nine-month
              postdoctoral research visit by Dr. John Hasenbein, University of Texas, Austin
              to work with researchers from the Center for Mathematical Research (CIMAT),
              under the direction of Dr. Victor Perez-Abreu, in Guanajuato, Mexico.
The
              focus of this research is to study reentrant line models for use in the
              semiconductor industry.  The production of semiconductor wafers involves
              hundreds of steps and jobs, which traverse highly reentrant routes through
              scores of machines.  Reentrant routing is when parts revisit machines multiple
              times in subsequent steps.  Efficient control of the production process could
              save industry millions of dollars per year.  Dr. Hasenbein's research will
              study mathematical tools that will help to analyze and control these production
              systems.  He will focus on stochastic processing network models.
The Center
              for Research in Mathematics has a core staff of 40 mathematical researchers in
              pure math, probability and statistics.  It also hosts many professional
              visiting researchers from around Latin America and the world.  CIMAT hosts
              numerous seminars, conferences and short courses related to Dr. Hasenbein's
              research.  Not only will he be able to establish enduring collaborations with
              these researchers from Mexico and other countries, but also his experience will
              contribute to the elevation of the international stature of the operations
              research and related mathematical modeling fields.
