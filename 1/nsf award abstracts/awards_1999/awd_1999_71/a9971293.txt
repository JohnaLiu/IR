     Let P and N be manifolds, where P is compact.  This
              project analyses
the homotopy type of E(P,N) = the space of embeddings from P
              to N.  The
aim will be to establish ``multiple disjunction'' results for
              spaces of
embeddings.  Applications of multiple disjunction are to
              include:

        1. the finite generation of the homotopy groups of E(P,N)

                        in positive degrees when N is euclidean space,

        2. bordism
              theoretic obstructions to embedding beyond the
           metastable range,
              and

        3. the study of higher order linking phenomena.

    
              Manifolds are spaces having a homogeneity property: they locally
``look like''
              euclidean space.  Manifolds are fundamental objects of
mathematical research. 
              One approach to studying them is to try to decide
when one manifold ``sits
              inside'' another one.  This gives rise to the
notion of ``embedding.'' 
              Specifically, an embedding of a manifold P in
a manifold N is a function from
              P to N such that no two points of P are
mapped via the function to the same
              point of N.  The set of all embeddings
from P to N forms a topological space
              E(P,N), called the ``embedding
space.''  The goal of this project is to
              understand better the space
E(P,N) by importing techniques from the field of
              algebraic topology.
