Abstract    :
              This research is an investigation of model-independent fault diagnosis 
systems
              that are intended to be robust, comprehensive, extendible, and
practical. The
              approach is to exploit the underlying probabilistic
framework of the system,
              which makes it possible to incorporate disparate
diagnostic algorithms,
              different sets of data, and a mixture of fault
models into a single diagnostic
              result. The use of heterogeneous fault
candidates will allow a diagnosis
              result that pinpoints problem areas based
on data gleaned from the results of
              logic tests, delay tests, and IDDQ
tests. The research results are being
              verified by testing them using actual
industrial IC failure data. Algorithms
              and software demonstrating the
research ideas are being developed.
