This proposal is
              concerned with the structure of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds. Our interests
              are in so-called hyperbolic manifolds of finite volume. In dimension 3 some of
              our main aims are to study the existence and properties of certain surfaces in
              hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Other parts of the proposal deal with interactions
              between number theory and algebra with hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Previous work
              has shown how certain invariants arising from algebraic data associated to a
              hyperbolic 3-manifold are related to the geometry and topology of the
              3-manifold. In dimension 4 we will explore constructions of hyperbolic 4-
              manifolds and how 3-dimensional manifolds can immerse in them. This is closely
              connected to problems in cosmology.

Manifolds are fundamental objects which
              appear naturally in many places in mathematics and physics. At present the
              study of 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds and the interplay between them is
              fundamental. For example, recently, the theory of 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds
              modeled on hyperbolic spaces has become central to understanding the spatial
              geometry of the Universe. Our work hopes to reveal more about these spaces. A
              major tool that we use in our studies comes from number theory.  As in the case
              of the solution of Fermat's Last Theorem, the interaction between number theory
              and our hyperbolic spaces is significant.  It is our intention to explore these
              connections.
