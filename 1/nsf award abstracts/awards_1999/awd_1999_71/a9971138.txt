Quantum mechanical properties of materials continue to
              produce novel and unexpected phenomena.  Within the past decade or so, the
              oxide superconductors, ruthenates, manganates, fullerenes and heavy electron
              materials have attracted attention.  Of fundamental interest are those
              properties that reflect quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale.  Such
              discoveries are challenging us continuously to extend our understanding of
              properties of matter.  New, inherently quantum phases of matter, such as
              quantum Hall states are discovered, as are new concepts, such as quantum phase
              transitions at the absolute zero of temperature between fundamentally distinct
              states of matter driven entirely by quantum mechanics.  Control over properties
              of quantum states of matter remains an engaging intellectual enterprise.  We
              are beginning to realize that underlying the materials science, there must be a
              set of physical principles, most likely simple in character; however, to
              discover these principles a genuine shift in thinking is needed.  The
              long-cherished ideas that have served us well for conventional materials have
              to be abandoned.  One can no longer think in terms of physics on single length
              and  energy scales, because the effects are entirely collective.  In contrast
              to high energy physics, the microscopic Hamiltonian is known with certainty,
              but the states of matter comprise unfathomable richness and complexity.  Thus,
              all such phenomena, by defintion, must be collective.  It appears that even the
              basic notion of an electron as a particle embedded in matter has to be revised
              because such a particle may not retain its integrity but break up into many,
              which is the notion of fractionalization of charge and spin.  The thrust of
              this research is this forward-looking view.  The chosen research topics relate
              directly to the phenomena reflecting the unusual nature of quantum mechanics. 
              Quantum phase transitions where matter is transformed from a metal to an
              insulator, or from a superconductor to an insulator is addressed.  Despite a
              long histroy these problems are unresolved in any deep sense of the word; proof
              of which can be found in the regular appearance of unexpected discoveries.  The
              theoretical difficulty is that we do not have the mathematical tools to treat
              strongly interacting degrees of freedom in matter.  An aspect of this grant
              consists of developing such tools from the perspective of field theory, as
              applied to the theory of matter.  In yet another direction, the grant concerns
              the development of a notion of superconductivity in which pairing results from
              the saving of the electronic kinetic energy of the normal state.  This is
              unabashedly unconventional because there is no notion of exchanging a quantum
              of excitation to mediate attraction between electrons resulting in
              superconductivity.
