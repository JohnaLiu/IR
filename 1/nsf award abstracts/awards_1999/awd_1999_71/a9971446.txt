Lagrangian submanifolds are the most important geometric objects
in
              symplectic geometry.  Lagrangian intersection theory is the
core of symplectic
              geometry, and on the cotangent bundle it is
the symplectification of Morse
              theory of the base.  Recent
results by Oh, Chekanov, Seidel and Polterovich
              demonstrate that
Floer homology, when defined, is a powerful tool to
              investigate
topology and geometry of Lagrangian submanifolds. On
              cotangent
bundles, Lagrangian intersection theory also provides
              an
interpretation of Morse theory, and when combined with the Floer
homology
              theory, it encodes symplectic rigidity in a canonical
way.  Outside cotangent
              bundles there are obstructions to
defining a Floer theory that come from the
              quantum geometry of
Lagrangian submanifolds.  Oh proposes to further
              develop
functorial constructions in the Floer theory and to apply them
              to
problems related to symplectic topology and mirror symmetry.
Other
              research concerns the variational problem of minimizing
volume of Lagrangian
              submanifolds on Kaehler manifolds, which is
closely related to Harvey and
              Lawson's theory of special
Lagrangian submanifolds. Special Lagrangian
              submanifolds are a
key to the geometry of holomorphic volume preserving maps,
              in the
way that Gromov's theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves played such
a
              role in the study of geometry of symplectic maps.  Oh proposes
to study
              various analogies between the geometry of holomorphic
volume preserving maps
              to that of symplectic maps in complex
Euclidean spaces (e.g. a version of
              non-squeezing theorem).

The process of constructing a quantum formulation of
              a system
from a knowledge of a classical approximation is
              called
``quantization'' in physics. The lesson learned from history is
that
              it is hard to quantize mechanics or geometry, and when a
mechnical system is
              quantizable, it reveals a very particular
physical and geometrical nature. 
              However, quantum formulations
of 3 and 4 dimensional topology have been
              essential ingredients
in recent breakthroughs in low dimensional topology and
              it was
essential to quantize classical (differential) topology to derive
the
              most delicate non-trivial differential invariants.
Lagrangian submanifolds are
              the most important geometric objects
in symplectic geometry and play a key
              role in the geometric
quantization and in the recent development of mirror
              symmetry and
string theory in physics. This research will aim at, on the
              one
hand, carrying out this quantization program of differential
topology
              and, on the other hand, understanding the inter-relation
between symplectic,
              Riemannian and complex geometries.
