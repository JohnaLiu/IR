     The investigator and his colleagues study complex
              nonlinear
dynamics for two extended systems: (i) Nonlinear Dispersive
              Waves
and (ii) Primary Visual Cortex.  Project (i) concerns the
              random
behavior of nonlinear waves -- specifically chaos for
near-integrable
              soliton partial differential equations.  For these
equations temporal chaos is
              now rather well understood; however,
far less is known about the more severe
              behavior of
spatial-temporal chaos.  Both its onset, as well as
              the
description of its macroscopic temporal evolution, are studied
through a
              combination of asymptotic averaging and numerical
experiments.  Project (ii)
              is to develop a theoretical and
computational model of the primary visual
              cortex (V1).  A point
neuron model of V1 is developed, with a realistic
              coupling
architecture between cortical neurons.  The model is
              constrained,
whenever possible, by physiological and anatomical
              measurements.
It has a multi-layered architecture and focuses upon
              dynamical
behavior of the cortical network.
     Nonlinear systems can have
              solutions that behave randomly,
even though the system itself is strictly
              deterministic.  When
these systems describe waves that are extended spatially,
              this
chaotic behavior is not well understood today.  Such extended
waves are
              prevalent throughout nature -- including the turbulent
behavior of air masses
              and ocean currents that influence both
weather and climate.  Clearly, the
              prediction of dynamical
behavior for such chaotic waves has fundamental
              importance.  The
investigator carries out mathematical studies of
              fundamental
chaotic behavior for idealized nonlinear wave equations. 
              The
brain is an extremely complex extended system whose dynamical
response to
              stimulation is a central problem for modern neural
science.  He and his
              colleagues, an interdisciplinary group of
neural scientists and mathematicians
              at New York University, are
developing a computational model of area V1 of the
              Primary Visual
Cortex of the Macaque monkey, the first cortical region along
              the
visual pathway at which cortical processing of visual information
is
              thought to occur.  Their numerical experiments are designed to
simulate
              specific laboratory observations of V1 -- with the
results of both numerical
              simulation and laboratory experiments
under continual comparison.  It is
              easier to identify possible
mechanisms for cortical processing through
              numerical experiments
than in the laboratory experiments.  Such
              interdisciplinary
collaborations between experimental biologists and
              computational
applied mathematicians unveil how the cortex processes
              visual
information, and will lead to a deeper understanding of
              the
functioning of the brain.  The project is supported by the
              Applied
Mathematics program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and
by
              the Computational Neuroscience program in the Division of
Integrative Biology
              and Neuroscience.
