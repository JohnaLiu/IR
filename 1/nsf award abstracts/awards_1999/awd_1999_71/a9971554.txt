Abstract:    Professor Canary proposes to study deformation spaces of
              hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In his first project, he will will study the global
              topology of the space AH(M) of hyperbolic 3-manifolds homotopy  equivalent to a
              fixed compact 3-manifold M.  The components of its interior are enumerated by
              topological data and each component is parameterized by analytic data. In the
              case that M has incompressible boundary, Anderson, Canary and McCullough have
              given a complete characterization of when two components of the interior have
              intersecting closures. Canary proposes to further investigate the topology of
              the intersection locus and thus develop a better understanding of the space.
              This study of AH(M) is analogous,  via the Sullivan dictionary, to the study of
              the Mandelbrot set in  complex dynamics. Canary also proposes to study
              boundaries of quasiconformal deformation spaces of geometrically finite
              hyperbolic 3-manifolds, as well as the structure of arbitrary geometric limits
              of surface groups.  

Canary studies the relationship between the topology
              and the geometry of a 3-manifold. A 3-manifold is a mathematical space such
              that about any point there is a region which looks like a region in
              3-dimensional space. A Riemannian metric is a way of measuring distances and
              angles in a 3-manifold. Once one has a Riemannian metric on a manifold one can
              talk about its geometry.  For example, the world we live in is a 3-manifold
              with a Riemannian metric. A hyperbolic metric is an especially nice type of
              Riemannian metric, which has been extensively studied by topologists and
              geometers since it was first discovered in the nineteenth century. Recently,
              physicists have been discussing models for the geometry of our universe which
              have hyperbolic metrics. The choice of metric for one's model of the universe
              is related to the issue of whether our universe is expanding or contracting.
              Much of Canary's research involves the study of spaces of different hyperbolic
              metrics on the same topological manifold.
