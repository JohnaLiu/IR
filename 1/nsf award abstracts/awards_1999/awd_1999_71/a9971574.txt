This project has three components.  First, push forward
              singular

connections will be analyzed and their associated
              characteristic

currents will be determined.  Second, the calculus of kernels
              as

developed by Harvey and Polking will be used to attack new

problems in
              differential geometry.  Third, calibration theory,

introduced by Harvey and
              Lawson, will be applied to geometric

problems.



In practical geometric
              problems it is important to distinguish

"local" from"global" information. 
              Here "local" means in the

vicinity of a point while by contrast "global"
              includes

information such as the distance from, say Washington D.C.,
              to

another place on the surface of the earth. Results of
              particular

importance for applications are frequently ones where
              global

information is computed from an assembly of local information.

For
              example local information alone, involving the amount of

local curvature of
              a surface can be used to distinguish the

global nature of a ball from the
              global nature of a inner

tube. This research will develope new instances of
              this important

procedure.
