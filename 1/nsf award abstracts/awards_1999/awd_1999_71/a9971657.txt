Forman
     Robin Forman is continuing his work on the global
              geometry and
topology of combinatorial spaces.  The emphasis is on
              adapting
techniques from the study of smooth manifolds.  In particular, he
              has
developed combinatorial versions of Morse theory and Bochner's
              method,
two classical techniques from differential topology and
              differential
geometry, respectively.  Many others have approached the study
              of
combinatorial spaces from this point of view, but it seems that
Forman's
              approach is simpler than that which has come before, and also
retains more of
              the flavor of the motivating subjects of differential
topology and geometry. 
              Applications have been found to the study of
smooth spaces, combinatorial
              spaces, and complexity theory.  The
ultimate goal is a unification of the
              study of smooth and
combinatorial spaces.
     Compact combinatorial spaces
              can be described, in a very
convenient way, with a finite amount of data
              describing the local
structure near each point.  There has been a resurgence
              of interest in
such spaces because they are well suited for computer
              experimentations
and calculations.  It is not always clear how to go about
              determining
the global properties of such a space from the local data with
              which
it is encoded.  On the other hand, the subjects of
              differential
topology and differential geometry are largely devoted to
              this
problem, except that the spaces under investigation are
              not
combinatorial, but rather smooth (and cannot be described with a
finite
              amount of data).  Some very general techniques have been
developed over recent
              decades for the study of smooth spaces.
Forman's work is devoted to showing
              that many of these ideas can be
adapted to apply to combinatorial spaces. 
              This had already led to new
techniques for the study of combinatorial spaces
              (which have been
applied to find the global topology of same very
              complicated
combinatorial spaces), as well as new insights into the structure
              of
smooth spaces.
