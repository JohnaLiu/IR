Abstract:
This research focuses on performing
              functional data analysis, the study of
sets of curves, when the pattern of
              variation across the population is
complex. Specifically, we focus on three
              nonstandard patterns. The first is
when some curves have a particular feature
              while others do not. The second
is when the curves follow a mixture
              distribution across the population, and
the third is where the curve
              parameters are not identically distributed,
but depend extensively on
              covariates.

Functional Data Analysis allows modeling of complex processes
              in
meteorology, oceanography, medicine, criminology, and other
              areas.
Realistic modeling of these processes often requires complex
              descriptions
of variation across the population. For example, if one
              observes
temperature continuously, one can observe the daily rise in
              temperature
during the day and the decrease at night. On many days, but not
              all, this
cycle is partially interrupted by storms. Models for daily
              temperature must
accommodate this behavior. The proposed research is intended
              to increase
the flexibility of functional data analysis so that it may provide
              more
realistic analyses.
