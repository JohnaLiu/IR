This project involves an experimental investigation of the
              materials science and physics of quantum-confined semiconductor
              heterostructures. The emphasis of the program is on both the fabrication, via
              molecular beam epitaxy technique, and the electronic transport measurements at
              low temperatures and high magnetic fields where electron-electron interaction
              and correlation effects dominate.  The systems which are being studied, namely,
              novel, high-quality electron and hole systems in selectively-doped GaAs/AlGaAs
              heterojunction structures, are among the cleanest (lowest disorder) carrier
              systems available.  Such structures provide a crucial and important test-bed
              for new many-body physics.  The results can also have an impact on the
              realization of new devices whose fabrication and/or operation are based on
              semiconductor structures of similar type.

This is an advanced materials
              research program in low-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures where
              electron-electron interaction dominates the physical properties and often leads
              to new, unexpected phenomena.  The program is at the cutting-edge of materials
              science and physics, and provides a unique training and research opportunity to
              the graduate students and postdoctoral associates.
