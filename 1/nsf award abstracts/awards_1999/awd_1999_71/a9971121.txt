Abstract    :
              A graduate course is proposed, which introduces high school teachers to nuclear
              science with applications, and enhances their understanding of basic physics as
              described in the Science Content Standards for the State of California.  The
              course is to be taught at the College of Science and Mathematics, California
              State University, Northridge, starting in the Spring semester of 1999.  The
              textbook to be used is "A Teacher's Guide to the Nuclear Science Wall Chart",
              which was produced by the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical
              Society in March, 1998.  The requested funds will be used to purchase equipment
              for hands-on experiments in the classroom.  The experiments will be based on
              those made by a group at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
