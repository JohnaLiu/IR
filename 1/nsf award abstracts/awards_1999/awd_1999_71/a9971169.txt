     Ionizing radiation produces chromosome aberrations,
              through
breakage and large-scale reshuffling of chromosomes. 
              Using
fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques to paint
              various
chromosomes different colors reveals a rich variety of simple
              and
complex aberrations, each putatively indicative of two or more
DNA double
              strand breaks involved in one over-all misrepair
reaction.  The investigator
              undertakes calculations on the
biophysical implications of current data on
              aberrations, and of
pulsed-field gel-electrophoresis data on DNA double strand
              break
clustering along chromosomes, relevant to the early stages
              of
aberration formation.  Three basic molecular models for DNA
              break
misrejoining are compared.  There are so many
              combinatorial
possibilities for this misrejoining that theorems, equations,
              and
computer simulations are needed for systematically interpreting
the
              extensive, elaborate current data.  The main methods are: (1)
suitably
              adapting standard results of probability theory and
stochastic process theory,
              mainly on Poisson cluster point
processes; and (2), extending CAS (chromosome
              aberration
simulator) computer software.  Collaborations with many
              different
experimental groups world-wide are continued.  Models that
              assume
randomness of break induction and misrepair can characterize
              with
reasonable accuracy, using only two adjustable parameters, the
relative
              frequencies of many different types of aberrations and
their dependence on
              genomic content of the chromosome arms
involved.
     Understanding the
              effects of ionizing radiation on cells is
an important part of fundamental
              biology.  Chromosome aberrations
are complex cellular endpoints, copiously
              produced by ionizing
radiation and informative about basic mechanisms of DNA
              damage
production, repair, and misrepair.  Aberrations are also
              robustly
implicated in the main areas of applied radiobiology,
              including
cancer risk assessment, estimating cell killing
              during
radiotherapy, and biodosimetry (i.e. judging past exposure of
              an
individual to radiation, e.g. after a radiation accident or an
astronaut's
              mission).  Due to increased current interest and to
improved experimental
              techniques, there has been a flood of new
data on radiation-induced
              aberrations.  The investigator studies
the underlying biophysics of chromosome
              aberration formation,
using state-of-the-art mathematical and computer
              methods.  His
methods discriminate between the three current molecular
              models
of aberration formation, which are needed mainly to predict
levels of
              radiation damage in situations not yet measured
experimentally, such as doses
              too low to be readily tractable in
laboratory analyses but nonetheless of
              possible concern for large
populations.  Mathematical and computer modeling is
              a
comparatively inexpensive way to maximize biological information
obtainable
              from the rapidly increasing databases and to help
guide experiments.
