This US-Argentina award provides for a three-day workshop,
              September 26-29, 1999, in Bariloche, Argentina.  Organized by Professor Gene
              Block, University of Virginia, and Professor Diego Golombek, University of
              Buenos Aires, this conference will focus on chronobiological research and will
              be preceded by a circadian rhythms course in Buenos Aires.

This workshop
              aims to increase fundamental knowledge of biological clocks, provide a forum
              for academic interaction among Latin American and US scientists interested in
              the field of chronobiology, stimulate interest among young students, and
              provide researchers the opportunity to form collaborative partnerships with
              colleagues from other countries.
