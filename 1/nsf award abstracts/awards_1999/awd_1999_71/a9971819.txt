	The University of Maryland Experimental Nuclear Physics Group
              consists of six faculty, two research associates, four graduate students and
              two undergraduates.  Our proposed research uses particle accelerators to study
              nuclear reactions and nuclear structure at very small distances.  In most cases
              we use electron beams from the accelerator at Jefferson Laboratory.
	Our
              experimental program is largely focussed on studies of the quark structure of
              nucleons and the dynamics of nucleons and mesons embedded in nuclear systems. 
              We use measurements of the spin direction of particles involved in nuclear
              reactions to enhance the precision and selectivity of our studies.  We are
              studying both electromagnetic and weak interaction properties of the nucleon. 
              We also propose studies of the production of strange mesons and the formation
              of nuclei with embedded strange mesons.
	In addition to the experiments
              proposed, we are heavily involved in the support and construction of detector
              systems for detectors and liquefied gas targets for the Jefferson Laboratory
              Experimental Halls.
