The project is devoted to application of certain areas of
              Analysis, especially Index theory, K-theory, and Hochschild and cyclic
              homology, to a broad range of problems that have implications in several other
              areas of mathematics and physics. A common issue in these problems is to
              identify the relevant algebras that model specific situation of interest.
              Sometimes these algebras already exist, sometimes they have to be constructed.
              These algebras will then be studied with the indicated homological tools, and
              the results will be interpreted as providing information on the specific
              situations that are studied.  Some of the applications include Index theory on
              singular spaces, the spectral and Index theory of Dirac operators coupled with
              vector potentials, and determinants of elliptic operators. A different but
              closely related type of application is a cohomological study of the
              representation space of a p-adic group.

The index of an operator in its
              simplest form is a number.  Many quantities from mathematics and even from
              physics and chemistry can be identified with the index of a suitable operator -
              for example, the number of electrons occupying a certain energy level in an
              atom is the index of a suitable operator.  The Dirac equation (or operator) is
              one of the fundamental equations in physics; the number of solution of the
              Dirac equation is very closely related and can often be identified with the
              index of that operator.
