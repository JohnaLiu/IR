Abstract    :
              Interfacial phenomena occur whenever a continuum is 
present that can exist in
              at least two different phases 
(e.g. ice and water) and there is some
              mechanism that 
generates or enforces a spatial separation between these 
two
              phases (the freezing of the water). The separation 
boundaries are called
              interfaces or free boundaries. 
The objective of the project is to study the
              time evolution 
of the boundaries from the following points of view: 
(i)
              generation---how interfaces emerge from an initially 
almost uniform
              non-stable equilibrium, (ii) propagation---how 
interfaces move, (iii)
              nucleation--how phases switch from 
one to the other, and (iv) pattern
              formation--how mathematical 
models can be used to accommodate and predict
              commonly  
observed phase patterns such as rotating spirals, oscillating
              
spots, expanding  rings, etc.  The project will for the most 
part be
              carried out on systems  of reaction--diffusion 
equations such as 
              activator-inhibitor  models in biology. 
The main tools used are the theories
              of partial  differential 
equations and geometric measure. Experimentation
              through 
computer simulation will be an integral part of this 
project in
              order to stimulate, predict, and  validate 
theoretical
              studies.

Interfacial phenomena are commonplace in physics, chemistry,
              
material science, biology, and even in mathematical finance.  
In all these
              areas it is important to predict, and eventually 
to control, the interfacial
              dynamics. The research performed with 
this award will study mathematical
              model that govern these  
seemingly complicated yet universal natural
              phenomena. 
The work will also lead to the  development of new and refined
              
mathematical theories and tools that can handle phenomena of 
instability
              and ambiguity. Such phenomena are often observed in
these applications.
