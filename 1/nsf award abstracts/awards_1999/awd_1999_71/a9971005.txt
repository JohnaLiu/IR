Abstract    :
              We plan to continue and expand our investigations of the fundamental aspects of
              quantum theory, with a view towards experimental applications on the one hand
              and obtaining theoretical insights which may be helpful in modifying the
              present physical theories on the other hand. 
We shall try to (1) obtain new
              quantum effects with experimental consequences, (2) resolve paradoxes arising
              from effects we have previously discovered, which may lead to new effects, (3)
              obtain greater insight into the quantum measurement problem, particularly its
              possible relation to quantum gravity, and (4) investigate quantum geometry, in
              particular its relation to supersymmetry.
