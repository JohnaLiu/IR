     This project deals with the structure of recursively
              enumerable
sets under inclusion, with emphasis on invariant sets
              and
automorphisms, and on definable sets with their corresponding
              finite
back-and-forth games.  There is a natural interplay between
              the
non-existence of certain types of automorphisms and the existence
              of
certain types of invariant sets.  This project will attempt to
              address
some of the combinatorial difficulties inherent in extending
              the
current techniques for automorphisms to finite back-and-forth
arguments. 
              This might help convert the invariant/automorphism
technology into a
              definable/non-definable technology, thus producing
possibly interesting
              definable sets.
     A recursively enumerable set is a set whose members gain
              entry
because a corresponding computation comes to a halt; thus
              the
recursively enumerable sets are examples of a phenomenon described
over
              time (at any given time one knows only the finite set of members
whose
              computation has already halted) but whose actual nature is
timeless (a
              potential member is either in or out---the computation
either eventually halts
              or it never halts).  So the recursively
enumerable sets provide an arena for
              studying the interplay between
the appearances in time of some thing and the
              timeless nature of that
same thing.  The method used here is to presume,
              despite appearances,
that two things are actually `the same' in the sense that
              they can be
identified via a symmetry (automorphism).  This either turns out
              to be
the case, or the failure of the attempt to produce the desired
symmetry
              may (and often does) result in a timeless describable property
separating the
              two things and explaining why they are truly different.
This project also
              plans to use the above as an exemplar towards
understanding the pre-Socratic
              philosophers.
