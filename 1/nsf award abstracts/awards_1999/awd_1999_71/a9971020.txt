ABSTRACT.   The project concerns the
              computation and applications of
topological invariants in 3-dimensional
              topology, with an emphasis on
the use of analytic  and differential geometric
              machinery. The
areas to be studied include the spectral flow of the
              Hessian
of the Chern-Simons functional and related 3-manifold gauge
              theory
invariants including the $SU(3)$ Casson invariant
              and
Atiyah-Patodi-Singer rho invariants.  Also to be studied are
              twisted
Alexander invariants of knots, links, and strings and  relations
              to
Casson-Gordon invariants and  also applications of the
Kirk-Livingston
              combinatorial knot and link  invariants.

   Kirk's work in pure mathematics
              has as its goal the solution  and
clarification of geometric problems in 3
              dimensions. The setting of
3 dimensions on the one hand is familiar to all of
              us since the universe
we live in is 3-dimensional. But geometric problems in
              this area turn
out to be very difficult for the odd reason that in such low
              dimensions
there is "not enough room to move." This tension between a
              vague
familiarity and mathematical difficulty makes this area a
              particularly
interesting area for mathematicians to study. Kirk's approach
              to
the area is to  combine traditional 3 dimensional techniques with
methods
              from other areas, especially methods that have made their way
into Mathematics
              from Physics.
