Abstract    :
              The award will support research on mathematical problems in fluid mechanics
              
and related partial differential equations and their applications, along
              
with the analysis and development of efficient numerical methods. The
              objective 
of this research program is threefold: investigate important
              nonlinear problems 
including compressible fluids with various constitutive
              relations, asymptotic 
problems, multiphase problems, transonic flows, and
              develop stable and efficient 
numerical algorithms; study dissipation
              mechanisms for nonlinear partial 
differential equations, especially for
              compressible viscous gas flow; 
and analyze and develop new theoretical
              techniques for the study of these problems.

Problems in fluid dynamics arise
              in many areas of science and engineering,
for example in gas dynamics,
              hydraulics, elasticity, plasticity, combustion, 
magnetohydrodynamics,
              multiphase flow, phase transition, charge transport 
in semiconductors,
              biological transport of ions, and etching and deposition 
processes.  The
              physical processes are typically governed by certain nonlinear 
systems of
              partial differential equations.  The award will support research on
the
              solvability of these nonlinear systems and the qualitative behavior of 
their
              solutions, as well as on the analysis and development of efficient
              
theoretical and numerical methods. This will lead to a better understanding
              of
these flow phenomena and their governing laws.
