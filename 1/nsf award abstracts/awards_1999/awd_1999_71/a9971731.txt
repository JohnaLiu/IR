This project is concerned with
              Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten Floer homology groups of oriented homology
              3-spheres Y. In his earlier work on rational Yang-Mills Floer theory the
              principal investigator has shown that interaction between irreducible flat
              connections and the trivial connection over Y can be described by a single
              integer. This integer is an invariant of the homology cobordism class of Y, and
              is additive under connected sums. The invariant is positive if Y bounds a
              smooth 4-manifold with non-standard negative definite intersection form. In the
              first part of the project the principal investigator will study the
              corresponding invariant in rational Seiberg-Witten Floer theory, which is
              defined for oriented rational homology 3-spheres with a spin-c structure. The
              second part will focus on the relationship between these two invariants in the
              case of integral homology spheres, using PU(2) monopoles. The object of the
              third part of the project will be to understand the homology cobordism
              invariants arising from Yang-Mills Floer theory with mod 2 coefficients. These
              invariants do not seem to have any analogues in Seiberg-Witten
              theory.

Broadly speaking, the principal investigator will study spaces of
              dimension3 and 4 using certain non-linear partial differential equations from
              theoretical physics.
