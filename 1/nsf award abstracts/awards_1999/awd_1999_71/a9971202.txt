Marilyn Breen will continue her work on visibility problems
              in
Euclidean space.  These will focus on Helly-type theorems and are
aimed at
              determining whether or not a set is starshaped.  A major
objective is to
              extend Krasnosel'skii's theorem beyond the
setting of compact sets.  Paul
              Goodey's work will focus on the
determination of high dimensional geometric
              information from low
dimensional data.  This data usually arises from sections
              or
projections of the high dimensional object.  In recent years
              some
surprising connections between projections and sections have
emerged. 
              He will try to find further connections and to obtain a
systematic explanation
              of these phenomena.  It is anticipated
that the techniques to be used will be
              drawn from harmonic
analysis, group representation theory and classical
              convex
geometry.

The geometric questions to be considered under this grant
              have
applications in quite diverse areas.  At a purely geometric
level, the
              study of visibility questions is connected with
robotics.  Helly-type theorems
              have been shown to have
significance for geometric optimization algorithms. 
              In fact,
Helly numbers determine bounds for the speed at which
              certain
algorithms proceed.  Reconstruction of objects from low
dimensional
              data lies at the heart of stereology and tomography.
The study of sections, in
              this context, amounts to studying
slices of the object under consideration. 
              The ability to obtain
information about the original object from these slices
              has
implications throughout geosciences and in medical research, for
example.
               Projections of objects are synonymous with X-rays.
Some of the projects to be
              addressed will have implications for
the reconstruction of objects from their
              X-rays and for the
design of efficient algorithms to achieve such
              reconstruction.
