     The project will deal with global problems in
              differential geometry
and related areas.  Special emphasis will be devoted to
              the roles of
symmetry and of singular spaces in the geometry and topology
              of
Riemannian manifolds.  In particular, one of the guiding principles
behind
              the project is: ``Classify manifolds with positive or non-negative
curvature
              and large isometry groups.''  This naturally includes the study
of manifolds
              with ``rotational symmetry,'' i.e., manifolds with one-
dimensional orbit
              spaces.  This investigation is also aimed at producing
new examples of
              manifolds with positive or non-negative curvature, a
problem of notorious
              difficulty.  Orbit spaces in general provide
important examples of the type of
              singular spaces that arise in the study
of manifolds with lower curvature
              bounds.  The investigator's efforts
related to singular spaces are focussed on
              stability and inverse
stability problems.  Answers to such problems will be
              instrumental in the
deeper understanding of the structure of Riemannian
              manifolds in general.
     Riemannian manifolds are an abstraction of curved
              spaces possessing
a distance function.  Unlike curves and surfaces in 3-space,
              these
manifolds do not necessarily sit inside an ambient space, hence they
              are
abstract spaces.  The research here aims to understand various
              global
aspects of these manifolds.  In particular, the investigator is
              interested
in ways in which the positive or non-negative curvature of such
              manifolds
affects their global properties, sometimes in subtle and unexpected
              ways.
Prominent among these are various symmetry properties, which will be
              an
important focus of the research of the investigator and his
              student.
