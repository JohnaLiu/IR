This project focuses on the experimental research of some of
              the fundamental elements of contemporary condensed matter physics, such as
              strong electron-electron correlation effects, quantum spin  magnetism in
              reduced dimensions, and their relation to the mechanism of superconductivity in
              transition metal oxides.  Primary emphasis will be placed on material synthesis
              and characterization utilizing NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance)
              spectroscopy.
%%%
There are two primary goals in this project.  First, basic
              research will be conducted in condensed matter physics to clarify the nature of
              electrons in transition metal oxides in reduced dimensions. NMR (Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy will be used as the primary experimental tool.
               NMR is the underlying principle of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) used for
              medical diagnosis.  Second, it will provide students with basic skills in the
              understanding of solids, so that they can cope with future technological
              development in materials for both basic and applied research
              applications.
