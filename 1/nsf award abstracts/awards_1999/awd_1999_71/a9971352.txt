McKenzie
     McKenzie will investigate algorithmic questions that
              involve
properties of finite algebras determined by the varieties
              and
quasi-varieties they generate: Is there an algorithm to determine if
the
              quasi-equations valid in a finite algebra A are finitely based?
Is there an
              algorithm to determine if the quasi-variety generated
by A possesses a natural
              duality?  Is the class of finite algebras
possessing a finite equational basis
              recursively enumerable?  Is the
class of finite algebras generating a
              residually large variety
recursively enumerable?  Additionally, he will work
              toward a complete
determination of all finitely generated varieties that
              possess
definable principal congruences.  Farley is working productively on
              a
large variety of problems in duality theory and combinatorics of
ordered
              sets.  Most significant is the conjecture that all perfect
sequences of a
              chain-complete ordered set converge to the same
``core,'' up to isomorphism,
              and, closely related, the conjecture that
the fixed-point property is
              preserved under direct products of
(unrestricted) ordered sets.  Farley and
              McKenzie will attempt to
prove Birkhoff's cancellation conjecture for
              exponents of finite
ordered sets in the case where the exponent is
              dismantlable.
     I.  Universal algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals
              with
the unknown.  The old adage, that if it looks like an orange,
              smells
like an orange, and tastes like an orange, then it IS an orange,
              does
not apply.  One can have a collection of objects about which all we
know
              is that one can add and multiply them like numbers, and that the
``usual''
              rules apply --- for instance, x+y always equals y+x --- but
still not be
              dealing with numbers.  Given a particular mathematical
system, call it A,
              there will be a whole variety of mathematical
systems that satisfy the same
              algebraic rules.  McKenzie will examine
what one can say about this variety of
              systems if one just knows about
A.  II.  The theory of ordered sets is a
              branch of mathematics that
deals with, well, order: If one has a collection of
              objects, and it
makes sense to ask, ``Is object P bigger than object Q?'' then
              one has
an ordered set.  For instance, the collection N of natural
              numbers
(1,2,3,4,...) is an ordered set.  Ordered sets can be added
              and
multiplied like numbers --- N*N is the collection of pairs of
              points
(a,b) where a and b are natural numbers.  A natural question to
              ask
is: If P and Q are ordered sets with a particular property, does P*Q
have
              this property?  Farley will address this question when the
property is the
              "fixed point property"; this is a difficult
long-standing problem.  Farley and
              McKenzie will also attempt to solve
a problem dealing with the exponentiation
              of ordered sets, a problem
over 50 years old.
