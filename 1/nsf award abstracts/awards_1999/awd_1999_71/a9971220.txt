There is a close relationship between certain critical exponents, the
              intersection exponents, for Brownian motion and random walk and the geometric
              and fractal properties of the paths.  This investigator will study the
              intersection exponent in two dimensions, in particular trying to use conformal
              invariance to prove exact values of the exponents that have been conjectured
              using nonrigorous conformal field theory.  The ideas will also be applied to
              continuum limits of other models in critical phenomenon in statistical physics.
               The goal is to give rigorous arguments using conformally invariant measures on
              paths for conjectures derived from conformal field theory.  The investigator
              will also consider appropriate conditions on random walks so that their
              critical behavior, i.e., their exponents, are the same as for Brownian
              motion.

A number of systems in two dimensional statistical physics at
              criticality, i.e., at or near the temperature at which there is a phase
              transition, are conjectured to have the property of conformal invariance in the
              limit.  By assuming conformal invariance it is often possible to give exact
              predictions for certain quantities called critical exponents which describe the
              qualitative behavior of the systems.  Neither the conformal invariance
              assumption nor the predictions of the exponents assuming the conformal
              invariance has been mathematically justified.  The investigator will look at a
              particular system, intersections of Brownian motion paths, and try to compute
              these exponents rigorously.  He will then extend these ideas to more general
              systems that satisfy conformal invariance.
