Abstract: Professor Roberts
              proposes to  study 
essential laminations in 3-manifolds. There are
two main
              directions of investigation. The first
involves working at better
              understanding 
nonexistence of essential laminations, both
through
              understanding group actions on
order trees (in collaboration with Professor M.
              Stein) and, more
directly, through
the use of
``standard forms''. The
              second
involves searching for constructions which 
give new information about
              exceptional
surgeries on knots and links.

In this research, Professor
              Roberts investigates
questions concerning the structure of 3-manifolds,
which
              are spaces formed by piecing
together blocks of 3-dimensional space
              according
to certain rules. Globally, the spaces obtained
are usually quite
              complex and model many
interesting phenomena. Our spatial universe,
for
              example, is a 3-manifold which it is 
crucial to understand. The study
of
              3-manifolds is also important in the
study of the knotting and linking of
              strings
in 3-dimensional space, which in turn is
important in the study of
              the structure of DNA.
