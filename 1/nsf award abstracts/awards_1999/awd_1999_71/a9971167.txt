Abstract    :
              This research develops a unified framework for the test problems related
              to
design verification and manufacturing tests. The design
              verification
problem translates to the reachability problem in an extended
              finite state
machine (EFSM) derived from the register-transfer-level
              specification.
Design-verification tests correspond to input-output sequences
              tracing
paths in the EFSM representation. They are derived by solving linear
              and
nonlinear constraints involving data registers, internal buses, and
              primary
inputs. Several search strategies for constraint solving are being
              explored
based on our result that closed form solutions to linear constraints
              can be
computed in polynomial time. Manufacturing tests are obtained by
              fully
expanding partially specified verification vectors so as to achieve
              maximum
coverage of faults in the gate-level circuit description. The
              verification
and test sequences can be iteratively refined through feedback.
              The
contributions of this research include modeling tools for complex
              circuits,
algorithms for constraint- solving problem, and new measures of
              fault
coverage.
