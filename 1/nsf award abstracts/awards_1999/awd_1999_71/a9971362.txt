Abstract    :
              Polyhedral Combinatorics in Representation Theory and Algebraic Geometry

The
              investigator studies the following research topics: tropical calculus approach
              to parametrizations of canonical bases for  quantum groups and their
              representations;  geometry of totally positive  varieties and double Bruhat
              cells; generalized determinantal calculus with applications to canonical bases
              for  semisimple groups, Kac-Moody groups and their quantizations;  generalized
              Schubert cells in multiple flag varieties. 

The project ties together
              several mathematical disciplines: algebraic geometry, representation theory,
              mathematical physics, and  polyhedral combinatorics. The main unifying
              ingredient is tropical calculus  which takes its origin in applied mathematics
              (control theory and  combinatorial optimization). This demonstrates the
              significance of viewing mathematics as a unique subject,  and that of bringing
              together traditionally separated ideas and concepts.
