We
              have been studying problems in Riemannian geometry related to
collapsed
              manifolds with sectional curvature bounded in absolute
value and applications
              to global Riemannian geometry and others.
We have made progress on
              understanding the topology of collapsed
manifolds with pinched positive
              sectional curvature, including
the fundamental group is virtually cyclic, the
              maximally
collapsed manifolds are diffeomorphic to lens spaces up to a
finite
              covering, the nonvanishing of the second Betti number for
simply connected
              manifolds. We have made progress on collapsed
manifolds of nonpositive
              sectional curvature, including the
existence of the local splitting structure.
              We have made progress
on Gauss-Bonnet-Chern type theorems for noncompact
              manifolds as
well as the topological invariants associated to a sequence
              of
certain collapsing metrics. We will continue our programs in
these areas
              in the near future. We will also begin to investigate
structures of collapsed
              manifolds with bounded diameter and a
lower curvature bound. This represents a
              continuation of work
proposed three years ago for NSF Grant DMS
              9626252.

One of the most important developments in Riemannian geometry
              in
the last two decades is in the understanding for the Riemannian
manifolds
              which appear to be smaller than their actual
dimension. For instance, the
              surface of a very thin donut looks
like a circle. A major part of my research
              focus on such
manifolds whose curvature are also between the curvature of
              two
spheres of different radius. We have found restrictions on
              the
topological structure of these manifolds. Our progress is
amplified by
              the amazing fact that among all manifolds whose
curvature are between the
              curvature of two spheres of different
radius, all but finitely many appear to
              be smaller than their
actual dimension. Therefore, we have made progress on
              the study
with a long history: the manifolds whose curvature are between
the
              curvature of two spheres of different radius.
