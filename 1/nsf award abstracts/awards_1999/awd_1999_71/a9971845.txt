The goal of this project is the study of collisions between
              relativistic nuclei and ultimately the determination of the properties of
              nuclear matter over a wide range of temperatures and densities.  Without the
              possibility of direct studies of nuclear matter in bulk (as in neutron stars,
              supernovae, or the Big Bang), one resorts to the challenging studies of finite
              and transient systems as provided by nucleus-nucleus collisions. This effort
              will be focused on participation in the construction effort for the STAR
              (Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC) experiment at RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion
              Collider) and analysis of the data which it generates.  The STAR Collaboration
              was formed to search for signatures of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), a phase of
              matter which dominated the early stages of the Big Bang. UCD has proposed
              tracking chambers which extend STAR's coverage into the forward regions close
              to the beam axis (high $\eta$), with momentum resolution and charge
              determination. Construction of these two small Forward tracking chambers
              (FTPCs), which will fit inside the central tracking chamber (TPC), is now
              underway at MPI (Munich). The FTPCs for STAR will be installed for the second
              running period in year 2000. UCD will use the STAR central TPC and the FTPCs to
              continue their studies of transverse, elliptic, radial, and longitudinal flow.
              These studies of the hydrodynamical behavior of nuclear matter allow one to
              study its compressibility, and hence the nuclear equation of state.
