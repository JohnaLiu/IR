Abstract    :
              	The proposed research concerns the analysis of issues which play important
              roles in models with interesting physics, particularly of the area of condensed
              matter.  The goal is to contribute to the understanding of the physics
              involved, and also to develop mathematical structures which are of relevance as
              well as of intrinsic interest.
	Particular attention will be given to: i) the
              stochastic geometry of excitations related to the correlations in systems which
              are critical in the sense of statistical mechanics, and ii) the de-localization
              transition for quantum operators in the presence of localizing
              disorder.
	Fractal structures play important roles in correlated fluctuations
              in critical systems, and in the nature of correlations in quantum spin chains
              at low temperatures.  It is proposed to continue to develop the basic tools for
              dealing with the emergent stochastic geometric structures, to study some
              model-specific and dimension-dependent properties in systems ranging from
              percolation to classical and quantum spin models, and to elucidate the
              relations with conformal field theory.
	Extended excitations play fundamental
              role in conduction phenomena.  The other goal of the proposed work is to
              analyze the de-localization transition, i.e., the formation of extended states
              in systems with extensive disorder.
