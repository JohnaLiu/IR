Filamentous fungi in the class Ascomycetes play an
              important role in freshwater habitats as decomposers of aquatic macrophytes and
              woody debris and deciduous leaves of riparian trees.  The freshwater acomycetes
              have been studied intensively only in the past 25 years and only a few
              geographical areas have been sampled.  In this study, ascomycete species will
              be collected, isolated, and identified from freshwater habitats along
              latitudinal and altitudinal gradients in North America from the tundra to New
              Mexico and from La Selva, Costa Rica.  Specimens will be deposited in major
              herbaria.  Cultures will be screened for production of asexual states and
              bioactive compounds and deposited in major culture collections.  Data from this
              study will provide baseline knowledge of the species-level diversity of
              freshwater ascomycetes in different types of aquatic habitats necessary for
              analytical research in ecology, conservation, systematic, and population
              biology.
