This grant supports a workshop on "Monte Carlo and Structure
              Optimization Methods for Biology, Chemistry and Physics" to be held at Florida
              state University on March 28-30, 1998.  The anticipated attendance will be
              about 100.  One objective of the workshop is to exchange information about
              computational techniques which cut across various disciplines.  The workshop is
              funded by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities and the Divisions of Materials Research,
              Chemistry, Mathematical Sciences and Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.
