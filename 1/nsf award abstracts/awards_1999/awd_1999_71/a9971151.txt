The principal investigator will continue his work on a few
              loosely related 
areas, including diffuse tomography, the phase problem in
              X-ray 
crystallography, some relations between the Darboux process applied to
              
orthogonal polynomials and the electrostatic interpretation of their zeros,
              
and a number of specific problems related to the bispectral problem. This
              
last one is an area that he initiated about a decade ago starting from a
              
concrete problem in medical imaging. This field has made contact with
              
several unrelated fields in mathematics, ranging from wave propagation,
              
commutative rings of differential operators, etc.

The principal
              investigator's work continues to be centered at the 
crossroads between
              "inverse problems" in areas of biomedical interest 
including X-ray, Magnetic
              Resonance and Optical tomography on the one 
hand and a number of mathematical
              developments in areas like 
mathematical physics and signal processing. The
              research program is a 
two-proned approach aimed at identifying  important
              areas in medical 
imaging that are ripe for improved mathematical treatment.
              In certain 
cases this has given rise to new mathematical developments that
              should 
eventually find useful applications. This work has proved useful in
              other 
inverse problems arising for instance in radar detection, noninvasive
              
evaluation, etc.
