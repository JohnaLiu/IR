Abstract    :
              This project seeks to further the state of the</DIV> art in the numerical
              solution of linear and nonlinear inverse</DIV> problems. This is a rich area of
              research</DIV> with applications to a great many problems in science and</DIV>
              engineering. In particular, one area of interest in the project is the large
              class of inverse problems involving</DIV> moments. For instance, the problem of
              reconstructing the shape of a</DIV> planar region given its moments is a
              challenging mathematical and</DIV> numerical problem, with applications in
              computed tomography,</DIV> geophysical prospecting, and thermal imaging, to
              name just a few.</DIV>
Generally, the solution of (ill-posed) inverse
              problems</DIV> requires the use of advanced computational techniques. For
              instance,</DIV> the efficient solution of linear and nonlinear least squares
              problems,</DIV> and the concept of regularization of such problems are
              important in many </DIV>applications. It is widely recognized that the choice
              of a</DIV> regularizing functional and the regularization parameters are
              both</DIV> central to the success of a stable numerical inversion approach.
              The</DIV> project is concerned with the numerically stable solution</DIV> of
              ill-posed inverse problems, particularly those involving</DIV> moments. A
              specific problem is that of recovering a 2-dimensional</DIV> shape from its
              moments, involving </DIV>(1) formulation and solution of regularized inversion
              schemes for the</DIV> reconstruction of shape from moments, and (2) applying
              these</DIV> algorithms to the reconstruction of gravitational anomalies
              from</DIV> measurements of gravitational fields
