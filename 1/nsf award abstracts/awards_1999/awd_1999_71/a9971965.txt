     The central theme of this project is Symplectic Field
              Theory.
This is a new area that is yet to be developed.  It emerged recently
              as
a generalization of Contact Homology Theory.  The project has
              several
goals.  One is to define new invariants of contact manifolds and
              their
Legendrian submanifolds and develop tools for computing
              these
invariants.  The second goal is to explore new algebraic
              structures
emerging from Symplectic Field Theory.  The third goal is to
              construct
new enumerative invariants in Symplectic Floer theory that are
              closely
related to three-dimensional Seiberg-Witten theory but may be
              easier
to compute.  Finally, Symplectic Field Theory should permit
              the
development of a relative analog of Gromov-Witten invariants
              for
symplectic manifolds with contact boundaries, and thus provide new
tools
              for computing Quantum Cohomology of symplectic manifolds.
     Symplectic
              Geometry and Topology has proven to play an important
role in different areas
              of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.  The old
and newly discovered areas of
              interactions between Symplectic Geometry
and Topology, Hamiltonian Dynamics,
              Low-dimensional Topology,
Algebraic Geometry, Quantum Field Theory, and other
              fields generate a
host of important problems.  A systematic development of
              Symplectic
Field Theory, which is the main goal of the current project,
              should
provide answers to some of these problems, as well as open new
              areas
of applications of the field.
