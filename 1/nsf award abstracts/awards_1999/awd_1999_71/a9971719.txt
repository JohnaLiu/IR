Abstract. This project involves
              the development and use of efficient
triangulations and normal surface theory
              in the study and understanding of
3-manifolds. A triangulation of a 3-manifold
              determines a class of
surfaces in the 3-manifold called normal surfaces. A
              fundamental principal
is that if a manifold contains an interesting surface,
              then for any
triangulation the manifold contains an interesting normal
              surface. The
guiding principle of efficient triangulations is reducing
              unnecessary
normal surfaces and improving the efficiency of computations
              for
triangulation based algorithms. They have exhibited remarkable success
              in
doing this and, in addition, have revealed new combinatorial
              information
intimately related to the topology of 3-manifolds. These methods
              have led
to new, effective algorithms for recognizing the 3-sphere,
              determining if
a 3-manifold is a Haken manifold, and solving the unknotting
              problem.

Low-dimensional manifolds provide the geometric models of most
              physical
phenomena. It is natural to study and understand all possible such
              models.
Triangulations and normal surface theory provide an environment for
              such a
study. Research in these areas is making significant contribution
              to
computational topology and complexity theory. It seems possible that
              these
techniques will contribute to better computer visualization and
              possibly
to advances in medical modeling.
