     Computation of algebraic K-theory of group rings R[G] is
              a problem
of importance in both algebra and topology.  In topology, the
              K-groups
house many invariants associated to spaces with fundamental group
              G.
One modern approach is through the study of so-called assembly maps.
They
              relate the computable homology of the group G to it K-theory.  The
isomorphism
              conjecture asserts that the assembly maps are isomorphisms
in all dimensions
              when the group has no torsion elements.  The
investigator will verify this for
              many groups that appear in geometry
and geometric group theory.  The method is
              to refine current techniques
whenever they show such maps are injective and to
              use this refinement
to prove surjectivity.  In another direction, the
              investigator will
develop techniques to handle more groups with combinatorial
              rather
geometric prescriptions.
     One of the primary problems in topology
              is the classification of
topological manifolds.  An n-dimensional manifold is
              a space that locally
looks like n-dimensional Euclidean space.  Examples are
              spheres, tori,
and other spaces often associated to such useful mathematical
              objects as
solutions to differential equations.  The most feasible approach is
              to
classify manifolds within large subclasses known as homotopy
              classes,
classification of such larger classes being the major goal of
              algebraic
topology.  Research of the investigator is directed toward
              resolution of
the Borel rigidity conjecture, the simplest solution to this
              classification
problem.  The conjecture asserts that a certain natural type of
              manifold
(technically, a compact manifold with a contractible cover) is
              unique
within its homotopy class.  If true, this rigidity, together with
              the
effective ways to compare the homotopy classes in most relevant
              geometric
situations, will result in a practical classification of these
              important
manifolds.
