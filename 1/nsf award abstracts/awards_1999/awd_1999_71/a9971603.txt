In the
              recent years, there have been a lot of interactions
between string theory,
              differential and algebraic geometry. One
main theme of these interactions is
              the dualities among the
different physics theories as well as their
              counterpart in
geometry. In the recent work of Minahan, Nemeschansky, Vafa
              and
Warner, they had predicted a certain family of beautiful power
series
              encoding the numbers of singular irreducible holomorphic
curves on a rational
              elliptic surface. It is rather mysterious
why the generating functions of the
              predicted answers constitute
the q expansions of certain modular forms.  The
              research project
is aiming at studying the relationship between their formulas
              and
the geometric universal formula regarding the reducible
holomorphic
              curves on the same rational elliptic surface.  To
fully understand their deep
              relationship, one has to study the
excess contributions of the multiple
              coverings of certain
holomorphic curves in the universal formula. The goal is
              to
understand the inner structure of these enumeration datum as well
as the
              geometric origin of the modularity behavior.

The super-string theory was
              originally developed to build up a
theory of everything, a fundamental theory
              which unifies the
rules governing our natural world. Surprisingly, extensive
              study
leads to some rather un-expected predictions in the ideal world
of
              mathematics, particularly in geometry.  The last ten years
have been a
              blooming period that these magic ideas and
predictions in modern physics
              change the way mathematicians
think. A lot of new structures have been
              discovered which we
really do not know too much about. Despite of the
              intensive
activities in this research area, it is still far away from
having
              a complete picture toward the full understanding of the
mechanism of duality. 
              The hypothetical string-string duality has
led to numerous predictions which
              the mathematicians were never
aware of. The present research project attempts
              to confirm some
mathematical predictions string theory has made, following
              the
previous research program of the author.  The confirmation of
these
              conjectures will give strong mathematical evidences to the
consistency of the
              original physics theory.
