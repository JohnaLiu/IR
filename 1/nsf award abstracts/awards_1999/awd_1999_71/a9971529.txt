Abstract    :
              This program will examine the interactions of ultra-low-frequency (ULF) waves
              with ions and electrons in the magnetosphere.  This approach will be to use a
              hybrid simulation code to determine realistic equilibrium conditions.  This
              would be followed by a study of the mechanisms which would generate ULF waves. 
              The nonlinear coupling of different wave modes would be analyzed with respect
              to critical instability processes such as ballooning modes and the generation
              of turbulence.  Finally, a new study will be initiated on the role of ion
              temperature gradients in transporting energy and momentum in magnetospheric
              plasmas.
