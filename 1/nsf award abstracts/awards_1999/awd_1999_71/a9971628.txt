The
              principal investigator will work on two topics.  Motivated by
examples from
              geometry and physics, the investigator will study
infinite dimensional complex
              manifolds, especially the
inhomogeneous Cauchy--Riemann equations on such
              manifolds, a
system of differential equations relevant to a host of
              geometrical
and analytical problems.  If the program is successful, it
              may
lead to extensions of the Newlander--Nirenberg theorem concerning
the
              very definition of complex manifolds.  There are very few
methods to deal with
              complex analysis in an infinite dimensional
setting and one of the aims of
              this research will be to invent the
necessary tools.  The other topic concerns
              embeddability of
Cauchy--Riemann manifolds.  This research will focus on
              compact,
strongly pseudoconvex Cauchy--Riemann manifolds of dimension
              3,
which is the hardest dimension for the subject.  We will study how
the
              size of the space of Cauchy--Riemann functions is influenced
by the geometry
              of the manifold itself, or by the geometry of
complex and almost complex
              manifolds spanned by the manifold.
Another aspect is related to discrete group
              actions on balls.  The
tools are from elliptic partial differential equations,
              geometry
and possibly algebraic geometry.

The main subjects of this
              research are functions of several,
possibly infinitely many variables. Such
              functions arise in the
study of complicated systems that can be described by a
              number of
parameters. For example the position of a space exploring rocket
is
              described by three numbers, the coordinates; the rocket might
be spinning, in
              which case the speed by which it spins is also a
parameter, and so on. Other
              quantities may be determined by these
parameters, e.g. the necessary intensity
              of a radio signal to
reach the rocket: they are functions of the parameters.
              In
addition to the above so called internal parameters, there are
also
              external parameters determined once the system is
constructed, e.g. its
              weight. This research investigates how
certain functions vary as parameters
              (internal, or external) are
allowed to change a little; and also how
              understanding "little" or
even infinitesimal variations helps in understanding
              large
variations. Two specifics of this project are worth mentioning. We
will
              focus on parameters that are complex rather than real
numbers---despite its
              counterintuitive nature, this assumption has
practical value.  Also, part of
              this project treats functions of
infinitely many parameters.  Whether such
              systems exist in nature
is up for debate, but undoubtedly they represent
              approximations to
systems with a huge number of parameters, which do exist.
