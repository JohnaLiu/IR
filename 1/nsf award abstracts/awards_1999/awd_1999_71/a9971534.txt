This project will explore the fundamental science that
              underpins a new aerogel processing scheme conducted at ambient pressure.  The
              two objectives are (1) to develop a more complete understanding of the surface
              chemistry that is so important to a recently patented process referred to as
              the DSB(Deshpande, Smith, and Brinker) process, and (2) to extend that
              processing chemistry beyond silica, which is the focus of the DSB process, to
              three other metal oxide systems of technological importance, viz., titania,
              vanadia, and alumina.  Various derivitization chemistries will be applied to
              each of the three new oxide systems which will then be characterized using a
              variety of techniques that include nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman and
              infrared spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy.

New materials that
              can be successfully converted to the aerogel state may have high relevance to
              technological applications areas:  titania is a photocatalyst that can be used
              to mitigate by photodegradation the effects of water pollution; vanadia is a
              potential cathode material that may optimize the performance of lithium
              electrolyte batteries; and alumina has uses in catalytic converter
              applications.  Each new aerogel material to be evaluated will involve the
              training of students in technology areas that are currently of high value to
              industry.
