This project is designed to document the diversity of
              fleshy fungi (Agaricales, Basidiomycota) in the alpine tundra zone of the Rocky
              Mountains, and will be the first survey of arctic-alpine mushrooms in North
              America outside of Alaska.  The Agaricales are a diverse group of fungi, with
              an estimated 80,000 species world wide.  They are ecologically important in
              terms of mycorrhizal associations and nutrient recycling.  While the abundant
              diversity of arctic-alpine fungi is well-documented for the Alps, Scandinavia,
              and many parts of the Arctic, the alpine fungi of the whole Rocky Mountain
              cordillara remain largely unknown.  This survey will help close the gap on
              circumboreal distributions, contribute new species, and provide collections for
              future evolutionary, ecological, and physiological studies of alpine fungi.
