Electrocodeposition is the process of particle incorporation during
              the electrolytic deposition of metal.  This process produces composite films
              consisting of a metallic matrix containing a dispersion of small particles. 
              Electrocodeposited films with micron size particles have found important
              applications in areas such as corrosion and wear protection, lubrication, and
              electrocatalysis.  Although composite films are currently manufactured using
              this technique, the ability to define the conditions necessary to achieve a
              specified volume fraction of uniformly dispersed particles in the deposited
              film has not been established.  An understanding of how the deposition rate
              depends on the processing conditions is essential to controlling the deposit
              composition and properties.  The objective of the research is to improve the
              ability to tailor electrodeposited metal matrix composite films of both uniform
              and gradient particle distributions by investigating the effects of process
              variables on particle incorporation within the deposit.  The
              electrocodeposition of alumina particles in a copper matrix will be
              systematically studied using a rotating cylinder electrode.  This electrode
              configuration allows the effects of hydrodynamics on particle incorporation to
              be investigated.  New materials structures of gradient composite films with a
              gradient in the particle concentration will be made based upon the results of
              the electrocodeposition study.  Existing models of codeposition will be applied
              to the experimental data, and an improved model or correlation of
              electrocodeposition will be developed.
