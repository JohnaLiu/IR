Abstract    :
              A fundamental problem in system level synthesis is the difficulty
              of
incorporating interfaces with pre-defined protocols as constraints.
              This
has lead to a mixed level specification approach that is difficult
              to
create, limited in generality and difficult to verify. In this research,
              a
alternative hierarchical model for a generic digital system design is
              being
developed based on a non-deterministic finite automata to capture
              system
protocol and communication constraints as well as the required control
              and
data-flow activity. Such models are suitable for exploration using
              BDD
symbolic traversal techniques. They provide a mechanism for
              systematic
data-flow synthesis that meets complex communication constraints.
              Issues
addressed in this project are: a) formulating an efficient
              representation for
a "causal automata" which represents the essential control
              and data-flow
dependencies for the system; b) formulating a mechanism for
              hierarchical
abstraction to support large, complex systems; c) pruning
              techniques on
implicit state traversal when used in synthesis; d) distributed
              controller
synthesis meeting scheduling goals imposed by the above analysis.
              
Software tools developed under this project are being distributed via
              the
Internet.
