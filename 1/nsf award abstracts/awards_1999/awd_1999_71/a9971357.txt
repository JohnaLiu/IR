The
              principal investigator proposes to work in two directions.
The first is a
              study of equivariant harmonic maps and other
variational problems by means of
              Morse theory.  There are certain
situations where a symmetric but singular
              solution of a
geometrically defined variational problem exists.  Under
              suitable
circumstances, techniques from Morse theory can be used to
              deduce
the existence of additional nonsingular solutions of the same
problem.
               The second direction is is related to the problem of
finding complete
              hyperkahler manifolds.  There are results of
Bando-Kobayashi and Tian-Yau
              which give the existence of
Ricci-flat Kahler metrics on quasiprojective
              varieties realized
as complements of suitable anticanonical divisors in
              Fano
varieties.  It appears to be a very restrictive condition on
these
              metrics that they should be hyperkahler.  However, if one
relaxes the
              smoothness conditions on the divisor, one knows
nontrivial examples exist.  We
              propose a search for nontrivial
Poisson structures on projective varieties
              which might be
associated with complete hyperkahler metrics.

The work in
              the first part of the proposal was motivated by a
question asked by a
              physicist who works on the theory of gravity.
There are certain special
              solutions of the system of equations
describing gravity in the presence of a
              Yang-Mills field which
have attracted a great deal of attention over the past
              decade
because they have no singularities, i.e. no black holes.  There
is an
              infinite family of solutions to this system of equations,
and they approximate
              a black hole solution in the limit.  The
question asked was whether or not one
              can explain the existence
of these solutions based on the symmetry in the
              problem and the
"shape" of the space of candidate solutions.  This problem
              is
very difficult, but there is an analogous problem involving
harmonic maps
              between spheres (trying to fit one sphere inside
another as efficiently as
              possible) which is more accessible.
The second part of the proposal involves
              an attempt to find
examples of geometric spaces called hyperkahler manifolds. 
              These
have been objects of intense interest over the past 20 years or
so, for
              a number of reasons.  They arise in algebraic geometry,
but also are related
              to issues in classical and quantum
mechanics, and have made an appearance in
              various formulations of
string theory.
