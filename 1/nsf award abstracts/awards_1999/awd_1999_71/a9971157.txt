The principal investigator and his colleagues, Richard Pollack
              (Courant Institute, New York University) and Emo Welzl (ETH Zurich) organize a
              research conference on discrete and computational geometry, which will take
              place during the week of June 27, 1999 through July 2, 1999 at the ETH Zurich
              seminar center in Monte Verita, Ascona, Switzerland.  This is the third in a
              series of international conferences on discrete and computational geometry
              going back to 1986.  Areas to be discussed include enumerative properties of
              arrangements, k-sets, geometric transversal theory, the complexity of Betti
              number computation, a new proof of the bellows conjecture, and the
              recently-announced proof of the Kepler conjecture, among many others.

The
              fields of discrete (or combinatorial) geometry and of computational geometry
              both deal with configurations of points, lines, planes, balls, polyhedra, etc.
              in 2- and 3-dimensional space, as well as in higher dimensions; i.e., with
              fundamental questions about simple (but usually many) geometric objects. 
              Discrete geometry seeks a basic understanding of such geometric structures,
              while computational geometry investigates the inherent complexity (difficulty)
              of algorithmic problems.  Many questions in applied areas can be reduced to
              problems about discrete configurations of many geometric objects.  Hence
              advances in mathematical understanding of the geometric structures and in
              computational methods for dealing with them can have significant consequences
              for applications.  Such applications arise, for example, in computer aided
              design and manufacturing, solid modeling, textile layout, medical imaging,
              computer vision, optimization, computer graphics and virtual reality, robot
              motion planning, geographic information systems, and molecular biology.
