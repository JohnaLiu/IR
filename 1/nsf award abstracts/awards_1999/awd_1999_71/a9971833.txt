Award:  DMS-9971833
Principal Investigator:  Guofang Wei

This
              proposal is concerned with the effect of Ricci curvature and
integral
              curvature bounds on the local geometric structure and
global topology of a
              Riemannian manifold.
The principal investigator will study 
(i) deformation
              of metrics to positive sectional curvature, 
(ii) optimal bound of
              isoperimetric constant, 
(iii) the structures of the fundamental groups for
              manifolds with 
pointwise or integral lower Ricci curvature bound, and
(iv)
              structures of manifolds with bounded weak norm. 

Geometric objects such as
              manifolds appear naturally in science
and engineering, as configuration
              spaces, as Einsten's model of
universe.  Ricci curvature is a fundamental
              concept in Einstein's
general relativity. Thus the fundamental research in
              these area
should not only be important in its own right but also should
have
              implications in science and engineering.
