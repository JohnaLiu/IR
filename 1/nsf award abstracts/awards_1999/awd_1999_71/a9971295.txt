This proposal deals with some problems on some important algebraic
              varieties related to homogeneous spaces, Flag varieties and their Schubert
              varieties.  In collaboration with Musili and Seshadri, the P.I. made a major
              break-through in the area of the Geometry of the flag varieties by developing -
              what is now well-known as - the STANDARD MONOMIAL THEORY.  This theory is a
              generalization of the classical HODGE-YOUNG THEORY developed in the 1950's. 
              This theory has led to an astounding number of geometric,
              representation-theoretic and combinatorial consequences.  Using her work on
              Standard Monomial Theory, the P.I. has solved many important problems on
              Schubert varieties - geometric and representation-theoretic. Recently, the P.I.
              has successfully applied her results to the study of certain algebraic
              varieties - certain toric varieties, ladder determinantal varieties and quiver
              varieties.

Homogeneous spaces are fundamental objects in Geometry.  Flag
              varieties constitute an important class of homogeneous spaces.  Because of
              their rich geometry and combinatorics, flag varieties form interesting and
              important objects of study in the areas of Algebraic Geometry, Algebraic
              Groups, Representation Theory & Combinatorics.  The Schubert varieties in the
              flag varieties provide a powerful machinery for the study of flag
              varieties.
