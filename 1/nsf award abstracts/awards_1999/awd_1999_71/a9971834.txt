We consider the problem of computation of partition function
              (in
thermodynamic limit) of classical particles interacting
              with
Moser-Calogero potentials.  Our approach to the computation of
the
              partition function can be viewed as a version of the
well-known in symplectic
              geometry Duistermaat-Heckman
localization theorem. The standard requirement in
              such theorem is
that the Hamiltonian produces a circle action. Many
              physically
interesting systems, for example, finite-particle
              Moser-Calogero
systems do not satisfy this condition.  We study our versions
              of
localization and convexity theorems when the dimension of
symplectic
              manifold become large.

At the present time the Moser-Calogero systems are
              subject of
intensive investigations. It turned out that some
              Super-Symmetric
Yang--Mills (SUSY YM) theories can be identified with the
              space
of spectral curves of the Moser-Calogero systems.  We found a
novel and
              deep connection between problem of computation of
partition function of
              Moser-Calogero particles and problems of
SUSY YM theory. The physics can be
              formulated in two different
languages, but mathematical nature of the problem
              is the
same. Progress in these directions offers new insights into
              the
geometry of spectral curves, symplectic geometry and, in
particular,
              convexity theorems, theory of Toeplitz determinants
and spectral theory.
