Abstract    :
              This grant will continue a Research Experience for Undergraduate Site at Kansas
              State University.  The research projects involving the students will be
              concentrated in experimental atomic physics but will include theoretical atomic
              physics, experimental high energy physics, some condensed matter physics, and
              physics education.  Students will be included into active research groups and
              carry out individual projects that fit into larger research goals.  This
              experience of active participation in real research will make their classroom
              work in physics more vivid, and will help them make decisions about careers in
              scientific research and other technical fields.
