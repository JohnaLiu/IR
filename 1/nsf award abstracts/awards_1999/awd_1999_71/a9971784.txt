Abstract    :

The proposed research concerns the condensation and analysis of
              spatial/temporal data for purposes of classification and anomaly detection. 
              The focus is a new approach to landmark estimation and spatial clustering based
              on spatial point processes.  Such processes provide a potentially rich class of
              models to express high-level prior knowledge about curves and shapes.  These
              models are more suitable than commonly used discrete Markov random field models
              and template deformation models, especially in situations where there is a lack
              of training data.  A version of Bayesian nonparametric curve estimation will be
              developed using the new approach.  A principal objective is to achieve a
              parsimonious specification of the landmark information (describing the location
              of the knots in a spline curve for example).  A further objective is improved
              methods for simultaneous inference from temporal data.

The benefit of an
              efficient statistical model is data condensation, or the reduction of often
              unmanageably large data sets to a parsimonious form, without the sacrifice of
              key statistical information. Another benefit is that it can lead to the
              discovery of interesting anomalies, given the availability of suitable
              inferential methods to lend credence to such findings.  Specific applications
              to be explored include off-line signature recognition and 2D-gel
              electrophoresis imaging.
