Abstract    :
              This grant will support interdisciplinary research in mathematics and mechanical
              engineering. The PI is a mathematician in the Department of Mathematical
              Sciences at Johns Hopkins. He will spend the 1999-2000 academic year as a
              member of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Johns Hopkins.  During his
              visit, he 
will interact with the various members of the department, but his
              primary collaborator will be Professor Gregory Chirikjian. He will work on the
              design and control of novel robots and motors.  They will investigate 
robotic
              arms built out of a network of discrete actuators, distributed/modular robot
              systems, and construction of a spherical motor.  This IGMS project is jointly
              supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the
              Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
