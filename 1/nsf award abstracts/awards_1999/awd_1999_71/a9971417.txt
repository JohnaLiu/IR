     The field of logarithmic-exponential series was introduced
              by van 
den Dries, Macintyre, and Marker to study the field of real numbers
              with
exponentiation.  This field has a natural derivation and provides
              a
useful algebraic framework for asymptotic analysis.  For
              differential
equations over the real numbers, there seems to be a strong
              connection
between having formal solutions in the logarithmic-exponential
              series
and having real non-oscillating solutions at infinity.  Marker
              will
continue to study this connection.  Marker will also work on
              more
general problems in the model theory of differential fields.  This is
a
              fascinating area requiring a sophisticated mixture of ideas from
stability
              theory, differential algebra, and algebraic geometry.  In
particular, he hopes
              to work on problems in differential Galois theory
and on applying geometric
              ideas of Hrushovski to understand the
geometric behavior of solutions of
              generic equations.
     In recent years, tools from mathematical logic have
              provided new
insights into problems in classical mathematics.  Model theoretic
              methods
have been remarkably successful in proving new results on the
              geometry
of solution sets to exponential algebraic equations and
              general
algebraic differential equations.  This work has already
              found
applications in asymptotic analysis, control theory,
              micro-local
analysis, number theory and neural networks.  One aspect of
              Marker's
work attempts to use logical and algebraic tools to understand
              the
asymptotic behavior of solutions to differential equations. 
              Another
aspect is attempting to understand the geometry of the solution
              sets
to very general differential equations.
