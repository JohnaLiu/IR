This proposal requests support for a group at the University of
              Richmond, a primarily undergraduate institution, to help complete the rare kaon
              decay experiment, E871: K_long to muon + electron, at the Brookhaven National
              Laboratory, to perform an R-zero hadron search experiment (BNL E935), to
              participate in a phi meson rare decay search (Thomas Jefferson National
              Accelerator Facility Experiment 94-016), and to study rare decays of the phi
              meson or the upsilon resonance.  All of these projects involve similar
              experimental techniques in the search for very rare processes.  The subject
              matter involves both Nuclear Physics and Elementary Particle Physics.
