Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of
              California Santa Barbara supports the research of Professor Thomas R. Pettus. 
              The theme of the research is the development of a novel synthetic technology
              that processes carbon atoms in parallel during construction of the molecular
              framework.  The asymmetric method being pursued will seek the level of
              discrimination of naturally occurring enzymes without attempting to replicate
              the complex structure found in naturally occurring enzymes.  This method will
              combine "2-directional synthesis" and "desymmetrization" and will allow a
              structure to be built from either or both ends in an asymmetric manner, as
              enzymes do.  Synthetic routes to spongistatin, phorboxazole, and saframycin
              will be advanced using these concepts. 

Chemical syntheses of sizable
              molecules often involves a lengthy and tedious effort that ends with the
              isolation of only small quantities of the desired final product.  Another way
              to synthesize many other pharmacological agents is by using enzymes that are
              able to make fairly specific molecular ensembles.  The work supported in this
              project will allow for laboratory synthesis of useful large organic molecules
              with a speed and efficiency similar to natural enzymatic methods.
