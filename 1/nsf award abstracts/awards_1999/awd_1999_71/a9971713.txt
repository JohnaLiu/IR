Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study mathematical models for superconductivity
              and 
liquid crystals. These materials are described by models posed at a
              variety of length scales.
The intent of the research is to investigate the
              qualitative features of the solutions 
to these models, analyze the thresholds
              at which the models predict change in the materials' 
basic characteristics
              (changes of phase) and investigate the connections between the 
solutions of
              different models at different length scales. The methods to be employed are
              
analysis of partial differential equations, asymptotic methods,
              homogenization, 
and numerical simulation.

Superconductors are used in
              electronic sensing devices, magnets and power transmission.
Applications for
              liquid crystals are visual displays and optical screens.
These are examples of
              materials for which their characteristic features (their phases) 
can change
              dramatically if subjected to electro-magnetic fields or variations in
              temperature.
This phenomenon is a great asset (essentially as if one has two
              materials in the same location) 
but it is also a difficult feature to
              control.The goal of the project is to add to the 
understanding of the
              behavior of the models and their interrelations so that these 
materials can
              be used more effectively.  This will be done by means of mathematical analysis
              
of these models in general settings.
