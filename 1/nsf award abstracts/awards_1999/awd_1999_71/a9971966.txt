The
              project consists of three parts and concerns constructions in
algebraic
              geometry and solutions to partal differential
equations.  Part I uses
              differential algebra to investigate open
problems of the KP hierarchy: Ritt's
              theory of constructive
differential algebra will be applied to characterize
              maximal
commutative rings of ordinary/partial differential
              operators;
differential resultants will be implemented to
              express
higher-dimensional reciprocity laws.  In part II, a connection
              is
established between rank-2 vector bundles with canonical
determinant over
              an algebraic curve, and varieties containing the
canonical curve.  By this
              technique, equations for important loci
of bundles will be sought, as well as
              the significance of these
loci in 2-Theta space, where the moduli space of
              bundles embeds,
with applications to the Schottky problem, for the 2-Theta
              space
of a principally polarized abelian variety.  These equations for
moduli
              spaces of bundles have potential applications to explicit
integration of
              systems of Hitchin type.  Part III will link
integrable systems and Frobenius
              manifolds, by producing a
symplecto-geometric interpretation of canonical and
              flat
coordinates on Hurwitz spaces.

The proposed work spans the areas of
              algebraic geometry and
differential equations.  While algebraic geometry has
              been a
field of basic research since the nineteenth century, in recent
years
              it has found applications to mathematical physics.  This
project explores new
              techniques to give answers to open problems
of classical algebraic geometry
              such as equations for certain
moduli spaces, or the number of polynomials of a
              given type that
define a canonical curve; it also explores new applications
              of
these algebraic structures to the exact solution of partial
differential
              equations that model physical phenomena, from water
waves to
              quantum-field-theory.  One new component is the use of
computer algebra
              systems, or symbolic computation, to implement
classical theories.  The
              computational focus will be an explicit
definition of algebraic varieties via
              differential equations; by
running the program through several classes of
              examples, which
used to be unfeasible manually, conjectures will be tested
              and
properties sought to characterize unknown features of these
spectral
              varieties.  Applications of technology to fields such as
algebraic geometry
              has attracted great recent interest, including
programs like "Symbolic
              Computation in Geometry and Analysis" at
MSRI (Fall 1998).  This project will
              produce MAPLE packages which
will be made publicly available to other
              researchers.
