Abstract: This is a group proposal which covers a wide range of topics in
              topology and geometric group theory, with connections to combinatorics,
              algebra, probability, and biology.  Specifically, the principal investigators
              propose to study: diffeomorphism groups of manifolds; spaces of knots and
              links; the automorphism group and outer automorphism group of a free group;
              Whitehead algorithms for groups; the space of phylogenetic trees; Markov chains
              associated to hyperplane arrangements, Coxeter groups, and buildings; the
              topology at infinity of Artin groups; and graphs of generating sets of finite
              groups.  

A unifying theme of this research is that of trying to understand
              abstract, algebraic constructions by relating them to concrete, geometric
              objects, somewhat as a sequence of abstract operations may be realized as a set
              of elementary manipulations of a Rubik's cube. The geometric objects in
              question are often very simple and natural, and can sometimes serve as
              mathematical models for phenomena in other scientific fields. For example,
              geometry and algebra have led to new results about Markov chains, which are
              used for simulations in many areas of science and applied mathematics. In
              addition, geometric insights often lead to the discovery of new relations
              between a priori unrelated concepts.
