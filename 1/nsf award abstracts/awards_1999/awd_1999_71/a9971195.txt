Abstract    :
              With verification taking about two thirds of the development cycle,
              formal
methods hold great promise of increasing the productivity of
              electronic
designers. To overcome the limitations of current formal
              verification
algorithms, this project explores adaptive model checking
              techniques. Model
checking is a technique for the verification of properties
              of finite state
systems. Application of model checking to large systems is
              hindered by the
exponential growth of the number of states with the number of
              state
variables---a problem known as state explosion. This project addresses
              the
state explosion problem by a combination of three approaches:
              verification
management, automatic abstraction/refinement, and binary decision
              diagram
(BDD) technology. These approaches combine to give adaptive model
              checking,
in which the verification management component identifies the
              appropriate
partitioning and abstraction strategies and extracts from the
              design to be
verified information that guides BDD-based algorithms to
              efficient symbolic
state exploration.
