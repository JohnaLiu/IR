The principal investigator proposes to study the destruction
              of chaos and 
the concurrent creation of structures (such as stable orbits and
              tori) in 
multi-dimensional (three or more dimensions) volume-preserving and
              
symplectic maps. Both analytical and computational techniques will be
              
employed. One approach is based on the "anti-integrable" (AI) limit,
              
introduced by Aubry in 1992. This principle yields analytical bounds for
              
the existence of chaotic dynamics, as well as an efficient numerical
              
technique for continuation of families of periodic orbits. By extrapolation
              
one can also follow quasiperiodic and heteroclinic orbits as well. The
              
destruction of chaos is signaled by the first bifurcations in the system and
              
the creation of order by the bifurcations that create stable orbits and tori.
              A 
second project is to classify the heteroclinic orbits and their
              bifurcations 
for a multi-dimensional version of the quadratic Henon map.
              
Classification will be given through construction of "primary intersection
              
manifolds," and by determining their homology on the "fundamental 
annuli."
              A topological classification of structures in dynamical systems is 
important
              both in the analysis of data, and in the interpretation of 
numerical
              experiments. It is well known that chaotic systems often have 
fractal
              invariant sets with various topological properties. These will be 
studied in
              this proposal through the "disconnectedness" and "discreteness" 
of compact
              sets. The PI will develop techniques for computational 
homology, yielding a
              definition for "lacunarity" and computational 
methods for Betti numbers of
              resolution dependent approximations to 
these sets.
