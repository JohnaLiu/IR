Abstract    :
              9971003

This work concerns problems in the Langlands program.  The PI and S.
              Rallis will study the combined use of relative trace formulas and theta
              liftings  in the theory of functorial liftings.  The PI with M. Baruch will
              study the local theory of relative trace formulas and its application to
              central values of automorphic L-functions.

This research is in the area of
              number theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of natural
              numbers.  It is among the oldest branches  of mathematics.  Within the last
              half century it has  become an indispensible tool in diverse applications in
              areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.
