This Americas Program award will support travel and related
              expenses for five junior researchers, to participate in an workshop in
              connection with an international symposium on sustainable mountain development
              to take place in Quito, Ecuador.  Organizers are Drs. O. Brent Berlin and
              Fausto Sarmiento,  University of Georgia's Center for Latin American Studies,
              in collaboration with Dr. Juan Hidalgo, Director of the Regional Panamerican
              Center for Geographic Research (CEPEIGE).  The  main objective is to
              incorporate new paradigms of mountain ecology and new viewpoints about
              sustainability in the Andes.  The specialized workshop will include subject
              areas of current relevance, such as conservation and sustainable development. 
              Specific objectives include, among others, to interchange experiences between
              scholars, policy-makers and NGO's, with the aim of linking international,
              regional and local knowledge on managing interfaces of cultural landscapes in
              the Andes, and stimulate scholarly research and institutional cooperation in 
              mountain development..
