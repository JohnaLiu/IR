              ABSTRACT


  The principal investigator proposes to 
continue his work with
              students on computational
mathematics from mathematical conception to useful
              numerical software.
The objectives are the further
application of modern
              geometrical methods  towards the development 
and understanding of accuracy
              and failures of algorithms related to
eigenvalue routines and in numerical
              optimization in the presence
of orthogonality constraints.  


 The kinds
              of numerical software that we investigate
mathematically are widely used in
              many scientific
and engineering fields.  These algorithms often
work very
              well, but are also known to fail on
occasion; new sophisticated analyses are
              proposed
to fix these problems.  On the education side,
these algorithms will
              be used in classroom settings.
