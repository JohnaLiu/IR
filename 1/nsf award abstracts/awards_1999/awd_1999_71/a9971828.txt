The P.I. will continue to study problems of analysis and
              geometry
on homogeneous and non-homogeneous spaces. He will use techniques
of
              group representations when these are available, and microlocal
analysis along
              with integral transforms, and their
generalizations to not-necessarily
              homogeneous spaces. A major
focus of his program will include Radon transforms
              on symmetric
spaces, especially their injectivity and restriction
properties.
              He will use symmetric spaces as a guide to analysis
on spaces with less
              regularity.  He will also investigate
problems in geometric inequalities and
              also several complex
variables using ideas closely related to, but formally
              distinct
from Radon transforms. Finally, he will consider orbitfold
analogs
              of Radon transforms (or Radon transforms modulo finite
groups) by means of
              invariant polynomials and enumeration
arguments. He will continue an active
              program of travel and
seminar visitors that has had a significant impact on
              the
scientific community in North Philadelphia.

Imaging devices are used
              with increasing frequency in medicine,
industry, science, and information
              technology. While engineering,
computational, and ergonomic considerations are
              critical in the
design, production and utilization of these devices,
              the
foundational operating principle is generally
mathematical. Typically, a
              mathematical theorem says that
information may be recovered from a
              geometrically defined
integral transformation or partial differential
              equation. The
Radon transform played a critical role in A.Cormack's
              pioneering
work on the CAT scanner. Today, this transform and
              its
generalizations play a unifying role in an expanding set of
branches of
              mathematics. The P.I.  will focus on the following
areas: 1) geometric
              inequalities, which relate properties like
volume, width, cross-sections
              shadow areas; 2) functions of
several complex variables, which may be viewed
              as data with great
regularity and which play an important role in
              mathematical
analysis and physics; 3) homogeneous spaces, where the
              existence
of a great deal of symmetry is assumed and its exploitation is
the
              ultimate goal; 4) finite analogs, where the continuous
harmonic analysis of
              smooth spaces is replaced by counting
arguments involving finite and discrete
              sets
