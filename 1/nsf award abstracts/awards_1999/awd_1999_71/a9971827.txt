In this research, conducted in an undergraduate
              institution, the relationship between superconductivity and magnetism will be
              explored in the nickel boride family of materials.  The overall goal is to
              identify and characterize the ground states of these materials. Specifically, a
              dilatometer will be used to measure the thermal expansion and magnetostriction
              of the magnetic material YBNi2B2C and the non-magnetic superconductor LuNi2B2C.
               A comparison of the resulting measurements for these two materials allows the
              separation of the magnetic component of the Yb compound.  Furthermore,
              undergraduate students will participate in this research.  Most of the work
              will be done on the campus of Occidental College, with the remainder at the
              National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.  The undergraduate students will fully
              engage in this project and gain first hand experience to do research and
              interact with scientists in a major research environment.

This research
              project will be conducted with undergraduate students at Occidental College and
              at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.  The research focuses on the
              experimental determination of certain magnetic and superconducting properties
              of two members of a family of nickel-boron compounds.  The results will
              contribute to the understanding of superconductivity.  Moreover, this project
              has a very strong educational component.  The undergraduate participants will
              gain experience in one of the current forefront areas of condensed matter
              physics.  In addition to their work done at Occidental College their presence
              at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory will give them experience in
              research conducted in a major research environment, where they will interact
              with experienced scientists as research colleagues.
