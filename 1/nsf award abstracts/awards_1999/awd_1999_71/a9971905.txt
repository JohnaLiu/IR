Abstract:
A fundamental problem of quantum topology is that of finding
              topological interpretations for the new invariants of 3-manifolds.  The first
              part of this project places quantum invariants in the context of knot theory
              and representation theory. The investigator intends to use this context to
              analyze the asymptotic behavior of the quantum invariants of a 3-manifold in
              terms of representations of its fundamental group. The second part involves
              applying the quantum invariants to form criteria for the existence of
              symmetries in a 3-manifold.  

The field of quantum topology began just over
              a decade ago with the discoveries of the Jones polynomial, by the mathematician
              V. Jones, and with the physicist's E. Witten's explanation of this polynomial
              in  terms of the topological quantum field theory.  Today it continues to be a
              dynamic area of research bringing together constructs and techniques from
              physics, algebra, geometry, and topology.  The purpose of this project is to
              investigate further how these ideas fit together.
