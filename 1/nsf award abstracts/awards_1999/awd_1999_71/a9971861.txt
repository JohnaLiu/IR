Abstract    :
              Myanmar (Burma) has a very diverse herpetofauna, but one that remains very
              poorly known owing to various factors, including the government's traditional
              policy of official isolationism and the lack of native organismal biologists. 
              We estimate that potentially between 100 - 300 amphibian and reptile species
              remain to be discovered within Myanmar's borders, many of which will be new to
              science.  This project will employ intensive field surveys over three years to
              generate extensive herptetological collections and to arrive at a comprehensive
              understanding of Myanmar's amphibian and reptile diversity, distributions, and
              ecology.  The PIs will work closely on this project with Myanmar's Nature and
              Wildlife Conservation division and the data gathered will assist the Myanmar
              government's own efforts aimed at conserving their imperiled biodiversity.  The
              collections that will be made during this project will be split between the US
              and Myanmar, where the specimens will form the core of a newly created national
              biodiversity collection.  All types of data generated during this study will be
              disseminated via a web site being developed at the California Academy of
              Sciences.
