Abstract    :
              The NSF award will be used mainly to provide 
travel support for participation
              of graduate students and
recent Ph.D.'s in the Fourth  Mississippi State
              Conference 
on Differential Equation and Computational Simulations.
The
              conference will take place on May 21 - 22, 1999
in Starkville, Mississippi. A
              number of well-known experts 
will present invited principal lectures at the
              conference.  
In addition, there will be sessions of contributed talks.
A
              collection of refereed papers from the conference will 
be published as a
              special issue of the Electronic Journal 
of Differential Equations.

The
              conference is organized jointly by the Department of Mathematics 
and
              Statistics, and the NSF Engineering Research Center at 
Mississippi State
              University.  An overall goal of the conference is 
to promote research and
              education in mathematical and computational 
analysis of mathematical models
              that use differential equations. 
The conference will provide a forum where
              mathematicians, scientists 
and engineers from industries, federal
              laboratories and academia 
exchange research and development ideas. This
              interaction between 
mathematicians and engineers will be a unique feature of
              the conference
