     Shift dynamical systems and Markov chains are useful
              models for
phenomena in areas ranging from discrete time smooth dynamics,
              to
statistical mechanics, to information and coding theory.  In
              practice,
there are generally many ways of describing or constructing
              shift
systems that have essentially the same dynamical behaviour.  Even
              in
the one-dimensional case, effectively recognizing when two concrete
models
              are equivalent is a fundamental open problem.  Another natural
and related
              problem is to study the different equivalencies or
symmetries between two
              systems.  Symmetries of a given system are
often called reversible cellular
              automata.  One approach to the
classification and symmetry group problems for
              one-dimensional shift
systems that has been fruitful involves strong shift
              equivalence
theory.  In recent years, this has led to progress on the
              Shift
Equivalence Problem.  This is a tantalizing question in
              symbolic
dynamics that can be posed in elementary terms using matrices
              and
graphs and that has been open since since 1974.  It has led to a new
type
              of positive algebraic K-theory for ordered rings by way of the
usual row and
              column operations on matrices but with certain
inequalities imposed.
    
              Strong shift equivalence theory is a combination of algebra and
topology that
              grew out of the dynamics of systems known as shift
systems and their symmetry
              groups.  It turns out to have unexpected
and interesting connections with
              areas of mathematics outside
dynamics, such as algebraic K-theory, cyclic
              homology, and topological
quantum field theory.  Wagoner will continue to
              explore these new
developments.
