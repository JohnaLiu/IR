This award isjointly supported by the Materials Theory
              Program in the Division of Materials Research, the Analysis Program in the
              Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Mathematical Physics Program in the
              Physics Division.  This theoretical research focuses on various aspects of
              interference effects in strongly interactive electronic systems and the study
              of integrable models.  Topics to be studied include: tunneling and quantum
              interference effects in electron liquids; melting and formation of quantum
              crystals; fractional quantum Hall effect; analysis of complex spectra of
              incommensurate systems; integrable symplectic maps; and onset of chaos in
              integrable dynamical systems.
