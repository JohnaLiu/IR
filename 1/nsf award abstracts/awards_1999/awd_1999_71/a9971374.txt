A
              central theme throughout all branches of symplectic geometry is
the importance
              of the special symplectic or lagrangian
submanifolds of a symplectic manifold
              and of the special
legendrian submanifolds of a contact manifold.  This
              proposal
outlines a number of projects that explore the interesting fine
line
              between the rigidity and flexibility of the shapes of these
special
              submanifolds.  Projects include studying the possible
efficiency of
              symplectically packing subsets of euclidean space
or cotangent bundles of tori
              and studying the possible evolution
of symplectic balls or legendrian links
              and tangles under
symplectic or contact transformations.  Techniques
              include
combinatorics and homology theories defined via generating
functions
              and pseudo-holomorphic curves.  In addition,
connections between symplectic
              geometry and biology are proposed
based on observed coincidental behaviors of
              legendrian curves and
DNA.


Symplectic and contact geometry have their
              origins in physics:
they are the setting for understanding spinning tops,
              mechanics
of underwater vehicles, and planetary trajectories.  A
              basic
problem is to understand how a system can evolve under the
natural
              motions imposed by a contact or symplectic structure.
One approach to
              understanding the dynamics is to start with a
standard object such as a ball
              or a looped piece of string and to
study the possible configurations that this
              basic shape can
attain.  The results can be quite surprising.  For
              example,
although many deformations of a ball are possible, a
              classical
result is that it can never be squeezed in particular
              directions.
This is a geometric version of the Uncertainty Principle
              from
physics.  This project aims is to give further insight into
              the
flexibility and rigidity of these canonical transformations.
