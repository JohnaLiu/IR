Research is carried out at medium energy electron
              accelerators, in
particular the university-based MIT/Bates Linear Accelerator
              Center. The main goal is to use the precision and versatility of the electron
              probe to study the structure of matter. The energy of the accelerator allows us
              to 'see' matter at distances where phenomena are governed by the strong nuclear
              force. Experiments are carefully designed to gain insight into the quark
              structure and dynamics of nuclear matter. This is a contemporary field of
              research that uses recent technological advances in the production of electron
              beams and nuclear targets coupled with specially designed detection systems. 
              At the Bates Center we conduct experiments with multiple magnetic spectrometers
              capable of making high precision measurements to advance the science. We are
              also involved in the construction of a new detector,the Bates Large Acceptance
              Spectrometer Toroid (BLAST). Up to date information in the development of these
              projects can be found at http://mitbates.mit.edu. Our research program under
              this grant  provides an excellent environment for the educational development
              of students and postdoctoral personnel.
