The proposal
              deals with gauge theory in dimensions three and four.  Specifically, in work
              begun with Zoltan Szabo, we intend to extend techniques used in proving the
              symplectic Thom conjecture to finding other gauge-theoretic obstructions to
              embedding three-manifolds in four-manifolds. A related goal is to shed light on
              the nature of gauge-theoretic invariants -- Seiberg-Witten invariants of closed
              four-manifolds, Seiberg-Witten Floer homology for three-manifolds, and relative
              invariants for four-manifolds with boundary -- with a view towards obtaining
              combinatorial techniques for calculating them.  

Work of Simon Donaldson has
              placed the study of three- and four-dimensional spaces squarely at a juncture
              between many diverse branches of mathematics, including geometry, analysis, and
              topology. And indeed, his work can be seen as part of the on-going dialogue
              with modern theoretical physics, which lead the physicists Seiberg and Witten
              to introduce a new equation with far-reaching mathematical and physical
              ramifications.  The goal of the proposed research is to study both the
              fundamental mathematical properties of this equation, and its interaction with
              the underlying geometry of the spaces on which it is defined.
