     The goal of this project is to develop and use
              analytical
and computational methods for geophysical wave propagation. 
              The
investigator and his colleagues have developed two general
theories: one
              based around radiative transport for elastic wave
propagation in the crustal
              waveguide, and the other based on
waves in nearly layered random media.  The
              mathematical issues
involved in radiative transfer are (i) the derivation of
              boundary
conditions (ii) the introduction and use of good Monte Carlo
methods
              (iii) the solution of realistic inverse problems for
parameter identification.
               In the case of nearly layered media an
important mathematical issue is the
              robustness of wave
localization, known to hold for perfectly layered random
              media.
Another direction of study is the assessment of the effect of
random
              inhomogeneities on time reversal imaging, called wave
migration in geophysics.
               The mathematical analysis requires time
domain statistics for time reversed
              pulses, which have to be
constructed by Fourier analysis.  Theoretical
              explanations are
provided for the increased resolution in time reversal
              imaging
due to the inhomogeneities.
     Geophysical wave propagation, the
              propagation of seismic
waves in the earth's crust for example, requires
              mathematical
modeling at several levels depending on the accuracy and
              the
resolution required.  It is impossible to simulate numerically
seismic
              wave propagation over a few hundreds of kilometers of the
earth's crust while
              taking into account the detailed
inhomogeneities in the earth's crust. 
              Radiative transport theory
can be used very effectively and at much lower
              computational
cost, and it can provide estimates for the codas (tails)
              of
seismograms with enough accuracy to interpret and analyze many
continental
              seismic events.  The project provides the mathematical
methodology and
              infrastructure for using radiative transport in
geophysical problems.  The
              investigator looks carefully at what is
needed to deal with discontinuities
              and interfaces in the crustal
environment, what is needed for large scale
              imaging from surface
seismic measurements, what is needed for assessing the
              waveguide
effects that appear in long distance seismic wave propagation,
and
              what is needed for the effective numerical simulation of long
distance seismic
              wave propagation.
