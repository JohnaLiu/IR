The Department of Mathematical Sciences
              at the University of Arkansas has hosted a series of annual conferences,
              focused on topics of current international research that are also related to
              research activity within the Department.  This conference is focused on complex
              dynamics, and features several of the international leaders in the field as
              well as many young investigators.  Most of the requested support is enable a
              substantial number of graduate students and young researchers to attend the
              conference.  There is also substantial support from the Department. This award
              is to partially support this seminar.
