Abstract    :
              9971282
Bartoszynski
     In this project the investigators continue their
              research on various
set theoretic notions of smallness in low levels of the
              cumulative hierarchy,
particularly those that involve measure-theoretic,
              topological, Ramsey-
theoretic, game-theoretic, or other combinatorial
              notions.
     Once ``infinite'' vs. ``finite'' was the mathematical dividing
              line
between ``large'' and ``small.''  In 1878 Cantor showed that the
              situation
is far more complex, and the development of topology or analysis
              complicated
it even further.  Today there are many different ways to express
              that a set
of real numbers is small.  Using the technique first developed by
              P.J. Cohen,
one sees that many questions involving these smallness properties
              cannot be
resolved in the framework of elementary mathematics.  At the same
              time the
study of these properties illuminated several problems from other
              areas of
mathematics, which gave this subject a life of its own.
