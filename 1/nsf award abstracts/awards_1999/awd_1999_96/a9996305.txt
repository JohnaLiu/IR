Abstract    :
              This award form the Synthetic Organic Program will support a series of   three
              annual `workshops on Organic Synthesis and Natural Products   Chemistry.` 
              These workshops have the dual purpose of (1) providing an   effective forum for
              informal discussion among young industrial and   academic scientists on current
              research in topical areas of  organic   synthesis and natural products, and(2)
              assisting the Program staff in   identifying emerging areas and researchers. 
              This process, in turn, will   aid the Program in long-range planning.The
              specific goals of the   workshops include:1) Providing an environment for the
              dynamic exchange of   ideas in organic synthesis and natural products chemistry
              among a small   group (about 20) of active young researchers in these fields.
              2)    Encouraging an attitude of cooperation among individuals working in  
              related areas, and thereby, avoiding duplicative efforts.3)  Stimulating  
              participants to study new problems  and methods in synthetic and natural  
              products chemistry.4)  Creating an atmosphere in which the scientific and  
              social interaction among participants will be both stimulating and   pleasant.
