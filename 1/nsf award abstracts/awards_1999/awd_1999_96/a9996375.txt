Abstract    :
              This is a planning award to investigate systems and software aspects of RAID 
              systems in which system development can benefit from theoretical research.  The
               goal is to formulate research problems that combine theory and systems efforts
               to affect the design and performance of the next generation of RAID systems. 
              The  focus will be in four areas:  data layouts that tolerate multiple faults; 
               on-line extendibility of disk arrays, in which new disks are added to a
              running  system;  efficient implementation of data-layout mappings;  and the
              effect of  system-level optimizations such as large read and write
              optimizations.   Collaborations with experimental RAID groups (such as
              Carnegie-Mellon University,  UCSD, and IBM Almaden) will be pursued, with the
              goal of obtaining new research  topics and new metrics.
