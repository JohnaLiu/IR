Abstract    :
                9610408  Tsukruk  Engineering of self-organized molecular films that 
              potentially have tribological applications will be attempted  by a combination
              of self-assembly, chemical binding to the  surface, and Langmuir-Blodgett
              transfer.  Emphasis will be  on very thin films that are expected to have good
              boundary  lubricating properties for MEMS and similar applications,  and on
              films that could serve as "markers" of actual contact  area and sites, initial
              deformation in sliding, and other  elusive contact phenomena.  ***
