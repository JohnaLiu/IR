Abstract    :
              Maria Coleman  University of Arkansas  9553267    ABSTRACT     Research topics
              include  the transport of small molecules through glassy polymer matrices  and
              membrane-based separations for secondary metabolite recovery. The transport
              studies will focus on modifying the polymer free volume distribution  through a
              combination of  synthesis of new polymers and post-synthesis treatments (for
              example, ion beam irradiation and thermal quenching). This research may lead to
              improved polymers that act as permselective layers in protective coatings for
              chemical sensors and membranes for gas separations.  Gel forming polymers will
              be modified  with functional groups that exploit protein-metal interactions to
              obtain membranes which continuously recover secondary metabolites from
              solution.  Membrane-based recovery schemes provide an attractive alternative to
              commercial chromatography techniques through  a reduction in process times and
              increase in volumetric productivity.  Greater student participation and
              practical applications will be incorporated into the curriculum by modifying
              the undergraduate laboratories, developing interactive software, and developing
              an undergraduate research in materials characterization.
