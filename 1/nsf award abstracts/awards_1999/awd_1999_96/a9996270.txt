Abstract    :
              9415930  McNutt         A marine geophysical/geological expedition is proposed
              to the  Austral Islands to determine how the spatival and temporal  emplacement
              of magmatic underplating relates to the volume and  chemistry of the surface
              volcanism and the pressures, stresses, and  temperatures in the crust.
