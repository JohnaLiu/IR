Abstract    :
              The question posed by the Pis  is whether the seafloor heat  flow in the
              vicinity of large seamounts chains is biased  towards low values by drawdown of
              seawater through the  archipelagic aprons.  A field program will be conducted
              to  test this area of variation of heat flow in close proximity  of the
              Hawaiian Seamount chain.  Heat flow data from the  vicinity of Reunion Island
              will also be used, along with  numerical modeling, constrained by seismic and
              bathymetric  data.
