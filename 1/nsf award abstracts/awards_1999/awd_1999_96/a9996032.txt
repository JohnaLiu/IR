Abstract    :
              This research is developing a new approach to testing of the next generation 
              Multichip Module (MCM) substrates.  The next generation MCM substrates will 
              contain high density interconnects and integrated passives.  There are numerous
               techniques that are being pursued in the packaging industry for MCM
              interconnect  testing.  These techniques are limited in the resolution of
              defect detection and  are expensive in terms of test equipment or cumbersome
              due to test methodology  to improve resolution of defect detection and to
              reduce the cost of testing MCMs.   A novel low-cost text technique has been
              discovered by this investigator for  interconnect testing.  Based on this
              discovery, the objectives of this research  are:  (1) development of electrical
              models of thin film interconnects and  integrated passives; (2) discovery and
              investigation of a low-cost test technique  for integrated passives; (3)
              develogpement of a parallel membrane probe technique  for testing high density
              interconnects; (4) development of test software tools  to locate process
              defects, and, (5) fabrication of a test vehicle with a thin  film MCM substrate
              to demonstrate and evaluate the success of the research goals.
