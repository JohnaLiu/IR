Abstract    :
              9701826  A four-year program of research and education is proposed,  covering a
              range of topics connected by a common concern with  OBJECTS and concentrating
              in two major areas: (1) development of  STATIC TYPE SYSTEMS for object-oriented
              languages and (2) study  of CONCURRENT and DISTRIBUTED OBJECTS. Specific goals
              include:  comparison and consolidation of different type-theoretic models  of
              objects; investigation of the key mechanism of "polymorphic  update" of
              structured data; development of useful partial type  reconstruction techniques
              for languages with subtyping and  polymorphism; investigation of the role of
              parametric  polymorphism in modular reasoning about concurrent systems; and 
              the study of type systems capable of ensuring various forms of  noninterference
              between concurrent activities. An important  research vehicle is the
              experimental programming language Pict, a  testbed for statically typed
              concurrent programming using  objects, based directly on Milner's pi-calculus.
              Teaching  projects focus on the development of the programming languages  area
              at Indiana University; major goals include a new core course  on Type Systems
              and a course on avant-garde "web languages."  ***
