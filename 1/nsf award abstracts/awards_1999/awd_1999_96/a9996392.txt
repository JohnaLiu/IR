Abstract    :
              9725507  Chung                                  This is a 36 month award
              proposed by Drs. Su-Yun Chung,  Uniformed Service University of the Health
              Science, and  Subramanian Subbiah, Wistar Institute, collaborating with  Dr.
              Limsoon Wong, National University of Singapore.  Drs. Su-  Yun Chung and
              Subramanian Subbiah request funds for travel,  communications, laboratory
              supplies, and computer time to  carry out a pilot experiment involving a data
              integration  and information synthesis system using the genetic data  collected
              from the fruit fly eye as a model.  The purpose of  this study is to develop a
              database query and integration  tool to handle complex biological problems. Dr.
              Chung's  expertise is in the area of homeobox gene regulation.  Dr.  Subbiah is
              trained in protein structure and function.  Their  Singapore counterpart
              scientist, Dr. Limsoon Wong,  is a  system scientist with a strong background
              in bioinformatics.  Their areas of expertise are complimentary for meeting the 
              project goals.  This study addresses a very important  fundamental question of
              integrating biological information  from disparate sources and could have a
              significant impact  on bioinformatics. This is a cutting edge project, which 
              will use the very Fast Backbone Network System (vBNS)  connection between the
              U.S. and Singapore.  The project is  jointly supported by the Singapore Science
              and Technology  Board and the NSF.
