Abstract    :
              9508319  Wolff   We propose to study the effects of immigration of unrelated
              individuals on the breeding success of established residents in a habitat
              patch.  Males or females that enter unfamiliar groups often disrupt
              reproduction by committing infanticide on young individuals or by disturbing
              normal breeding patterns.  This study will document breeding success, survival,
              and population growth of the gray-tailed vole in habitat patches differing in
              degree of isolation.  Animal movement, survival, and numbers will be determined
              by live-trapping, marking, and releasing animals within experimental
              enclosures.  This study will allow us to test the role of kinship versus
              unfamiliarity in the breeding success of animals in fragmented landscapes. 
              Construction of corridors to permit movement of animals between fragments has
              been suggested as a mechanism for maintaining viable populations increasingly
              fragmented by human activity.  This study will contribute to our ability to
              manage habitat patches by increasing our understanding of the effect of
              behavior on breeding success.
