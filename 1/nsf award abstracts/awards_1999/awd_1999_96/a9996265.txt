Abstract    :
                Previously research lead to software requirements  completeness criteria for
              process control systems.  These  criteria, however, did not include the
              human-computer  interface. This research involves extending these criteria  to
              specify appropriate abstractions and completeness  requirements for
              man-in-the-loop systems and devising hazard  analysis techniques for the
              human-computer interface. Four  questions are examined: (1) What information
              needs to be  specified in a software requirements specification to ensure 
              safety for software that includes a human-computer  interface; (2) How can
              traditional hazard analyses be  extended to include human-computer interface
              issues; (3) How  can the information from these hazard analyses be used to 
              improve the human-computer interface design; (4) How can a  state-machine-based
              requirements specification be analyzed  for compliance with some of these
              human-interface criteria,  how can specification languages be designed to
              enhance the  ability to perform this analysis, and to enhance the ability  to
              generate safe human-computer interface designs.  ***
