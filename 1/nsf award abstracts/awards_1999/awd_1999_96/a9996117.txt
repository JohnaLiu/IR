Abstract    :
              9734343  Naeem  This proposal outlines an integrated program of research,
              teaching, and training designed to promote cross-cutting and multidisciplinary
              approaches in basic biology and ecology. The research component fills an
              important gap in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning studies. The proposed work
              is a long-term, multi-trophic level investigation of the interaction between
              variation in trophic structure and plant diversity, and its impacts on
              fundamental ecosystem processes among plants, animals and microbes. The study
              system is the Cedar Creek Natural History Area LTER site. The educational
              component breaks traditional disciplinary boundaries by focusing on interfaces
              between biota and biogeochemistry, rather than the cell to ecosystem hierarchy.
              Training of students will occur by involving undergraduates in hands-on
              research opportunities. For students with some biological background and
              research experience, further training will include hypothesis testing,
              statistical approaches, ethics, and peer review. Collectively, this project
              will provide a foundation for a long-term academic career devoted to the
              development of pluralistic and synthetic approaches in ecological research and
              education.
