                This  GOALI experimental research project is concerned  with  new  basic
              experiments probing the nature of superconductivity in  the  simplest  cuprate
              high Tc superconductors, those  containing  one  CuO2  plane per unit cell. The
              project has two aspects, the first  being  growth  of  excellent epitaxial
              films of  Tl2201  on  tri-  crystal and other substrates. This will be
              performed by the PI at  SUNY Buffalo. The second task is a set of subtle
              measurements  to  be  made  at  IBM supervised by the IBM co-PI's in  the 
              project.  These   measurements  will  include  but  not   be   limited   to 
              measurements using a state-of-the-art scanning SQUID  microscope.  The  
              measurements  are  designed  to  clarify  the   nature   of  superconductivity 
              and  the symmetry of the  order  parameter  in  excellent  single  layer
              samples. This choice of  samples  avoids  complications  of  copper chains and
              interlayer interactions,  to  enable  more  transparent  tests of the  relevant
               theories.  The  research will involve a postdoctoral researcher who will 
              receive  excellent  training  at both locations, beneficial  to  a  future 
              career  in  industry,  government  or  academia.  This  work   is 
              interdisciplinary  in  nature and is supported  in  part  by  the  Office  of 
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical  and  Physics Sciences
              Directorate at NSF.  %%%  This  experimental research project is in the
              category  of  Grant  Opportunities  for Academic Liaison With Industry (GOALI),

              researchers.   This  GOALI  experimental  research   project   is  concerned
