Abstract    :
              9705717  Elimelech  This is an award to support research on colloid-facilitated 
              transport of contaminants in groundwater aquifers.  Objectives of  the project
              are to develop a theoretical model for release of  colloidal particles from
              porous media of groundwater aquifers and  to conduct experiments to evaluate
              the model's constituent  hypothesis that colloid release from chemically
              heterogeneous  porous media surfaces following reductions in ionic strength is 
              controlled by colloid to colloid interactions rather than by  interactions
              between colloids and grain mineral. The experiments  will be conducted using
              laboratory columns packed with porous  media having varied ratios of clean and
              surface modified grains  using well-defined colloidal suspensions.    Results
              of this project are expected to improve our basic  understanding of the
              mechanisms that control the transport and  mobility of colloids in groundwater.
               This knowledge can be  directly applied to engineering design of systems for 
              decontamination of groundwater and may have broader significance  in improving
              design and operation of filtration processes,  chromatographic separations and
              other processes that involve  separation of particles from fluids in which they
              are suspended.  ***
