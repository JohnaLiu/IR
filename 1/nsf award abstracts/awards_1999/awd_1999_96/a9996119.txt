Abstract    :
              Overall, the PI will improve understanding of acoustic gravity waves in the
              high-latitude thermosphere.  Mainly, he will analyze data from the SuperDARN HF
              radar network.  Building upon previous work, he will use techniques developed
              both for observation of gravity waves and observation of plasma flows and
              field-aligned currents.  Various aspects of the waves to be investigated
              include:  examining the connection between solar wind and IMF changes and
              generating gravity waves, determining the amount of gravity wave energy in the
              high-latitude thermosphere due to solar and magnetospheric energy sources, and
              determining how much of the energy that is deposited in the upper mesosphere
              and lower thermosphere as Joule heating is carried away to the upper
              thermosphere by gravity waves.  Finally, he will continue pursuing a
              theoretical understanding of wave reflection from the mesopause.
