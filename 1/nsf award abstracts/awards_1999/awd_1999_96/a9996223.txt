Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Ronald A. Siegel, of the School of Pharmacy of the University   of California
              at San Francisco will study pulsating polymer gels. This is   research destined
              to construct a chemical oscillator that could be  used   as a periodic
              pulsating delivery system for compounds such as hormones,   antibiotics or cell
              specific cancer chemotherapeutic agents. A specific   realization is proposed
              where the membrane is a copolymer of   N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) and
              methacrylic acid, the substrate is   glucose and the enzyme is glucose oxydase,
              gluconolactonase and catalase   and the product is acidic protons. It is shown
              that the NIPA/MMA   membranes are very permeable to glucose above a critical pH
              while below   they are glucose impermeable. This is the essential feature of
              the   pulsating mechanism.  In the proposed work a chemomechanical pulsar will
              be constructed and the   model predictions will be tested.  The effects of gel 
              composition and pH   buffers will be tested, and used in the refinement of the
              mathematical   model. Different designs will be tested to improve the
              versatility of the   device.
