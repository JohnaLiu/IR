Abstract    :
                        9801574  Pandharipande      In this project, Pandharipande will study
              Gromov-Witten invariants of algebraic varieties. The project goals are to
              establish the Virasoro constraints in certain fundamental cases, find new
              universal relations, understand related Chow rings of spaces of stable maps,
              and study the enumerative geometry of descendent integrals. Virtual
              localization techniques will be studied and used.    This is research in the
              field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of
              modern mathematics, but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the
              past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined 
              in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field
              makes use of methods not only from algebra,  but from analysis and topology,
              and conversely is finding  application in those fields as well as in physics,
              theoretical  computer science, and robotics.
