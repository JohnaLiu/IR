Abstract    :
              9531133  Narayanamurti  A unique, variable temperature, Ballistic Electron
              Emission Microscope (BEEM) recently developed at Santa Barbara will be used to
              perform the first spatial studies of local electronic band structure and
              transport of novel compound semiconductor heterostructures and quantum wells in
              GaInP/GaAs and A1GaN/GaN.  Both of these materials systems have great
              technological importance for optoelectronic devices, and there is a strong
              electronic materials and device effort at UCSB in this area.  Yet the
              fundamental knowledge of important electronic parameters, such as heterjunction
              band offsets, is either poorly understood (GaInP\GaAs) or unknown (A1GaN/GaN). 
              Initial BEEM studies at UCSB in the prototypical  A1xG1-xAs/GaAs system have
              very recently shown the power of BEEM to perform spectroscopy of semiconductor
              heterostructures buried spatially below the Schottky barrier and gives us
              confidence in the potential of the technique for probing new materials systems 
                Such studies using BEEM have never been done before.  It is anticipated that
              the results of this undertaking will yield a concrete body of invaluable
              information which will lead to understanding of transport in quantum
              heterostructures, and will enable the characterization of technologically
              important (and heretofore poorly understood) semiconductor materials on a local
              scale.  ***
