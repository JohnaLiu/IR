Abstract    :
              9870880  Pace     Hyperthermophilic organisms (growth optima > 80 C), at the
              upper temperature extremes for life, are a significantly underexplored pool of
              biota with substantial potential for biotechnology.  Little is known about the
              diversity of life at high temperatures because most studies have relied on
              pure-culture techniques for the identification of organisms, but only a minor
              fraction, < 1%, of naturally occurring microorganisms, is cultured using
              standard techniques.  Recently, however, molecular techniques, based on cloning
              and sequencing ribosomal RNA genes and not requiring culture for the
              identification of organisms in nature, have revealed an unexpected wealth of
              previously unknown, high-temperature microbes.  The overall goals of this
              program are to use these methods to further describe and to understand the
              organismal composition, structure and physiological basis of selected
              high-temperature ecosystems, and to use molecular tracers to cultivate
              particular types of organisms for further study.  Where cultivation is
              successful, growth-properties of specific organisms will test physiological
              hypotheses based on sequence and in situ information.  Numerous environmentally
              significant organisms that can be enriched for continued model studies in
              consortia or pure cultures are likely to be identified.  High-temperature
              environments to be addressed include selected, chemically diverse, Yellowstone
              and deep-sea hydrothermal vent-associated settings.
