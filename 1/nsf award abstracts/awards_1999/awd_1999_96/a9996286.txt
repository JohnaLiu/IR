Title: Theoretical and experiment studies of semiconductor laser
              quantum noise

Abstract

The proposal is to study theoretically and
              experimentally the quantum noise of semiconductor lasers. Preliminary studies
              indicated that a minimum laser linewidth in the mHz range can be obtained. 
              Refinement of the theory and experimental verifications will be investigated.
