Abstract    :
              9628094  MARTIN  Lamniform sharks include infamous (Great White Shark) and
              spectacularly large (Basking Shark) forms among their sixteen living species. 
              Despite work that has been done on the morphology and molecular biology of
              these fish, and fossils that appear beginning approximately 140 million years
              ago, the phylogenetic relationships of lamniform sharks, and therefore the
              origins of the extreme diversity among species in morphology, anatomy,
              physiology and habitat, are not well understood.  In this study, Andrew Martin
              will evaluate the phylogenetic relationships among these sharks.  He will
              obtain molecular sequence information from nuclear genes in the creatine kinase
              gene family, and use these sequences to construct phylogenetic trees.  These
              trees will then be compared with trees constructed from other morphological and
              molecular information.  Data from all these sources will attempt to answer
              questions about lamniform shark history; for example, whether the ability to
              eat plankton (as opposed to larger prey) arose once, or more than once, among
              these fish.  The study should also help scientists understand how genes change
              during the history of a group of organisms, and how these changes may be
              related to changes in an organism's shape or behavior over long periods of
              time.
