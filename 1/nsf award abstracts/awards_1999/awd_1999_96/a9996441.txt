Abstract    :
              9875763  Schlautman  This is an award to support research on the process by
              which naturally-occurring and benign materials can be converted into efficient
              heterogeneous catalysts for use in processes to remove organic and inorganic
              contaminants from water, soils and sediments.  The efficacy of immobilizing
              biomimetic catalysts on natural mineral substrates will be investigated by
              conducting the immobilization process to produce catalysts, using the catalysts
              produced to destroy selected organic and inorganic target pollutants, adsorbing
              target pollutants to inactivated catalysts and finally determination of the
              long-term viability of the immobilized catalysts.The proposal leading to this
              award was submitted in response to the Faculty Early Career Development
              (CAREER) Program which emphasizes combining discovery of new knowledge with
              inspired teaching and enthusiastic learning.  The research component of this
              project is expected to provide knowledge that can be applied in engineering
              design of processes and systems to decontaminate water, soil and sediments. 
              The educational component will provide undergraduate and graduate students with
              knowledge of the processes that occur when organic and inorganic pollutants are
              destroyed by biomimetic catalysts as a step toward coupling this process with
              oxidation reactions and development of even more efficient systems to
              decontaminate environmental media.  This project will also provide students
              with access to modern techniques for study of physical and chemical processes
              that are significant in environmental engineering practice and opportunity to
              observe their professional application in engineering design of treatment
              processes and systems.  ***
