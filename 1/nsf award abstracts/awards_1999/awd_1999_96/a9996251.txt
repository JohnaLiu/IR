Abstract    :
                9321718  Pister    This research involves the study of concepts and techniques
              for  design, fabrication, and testing of a family of multiple degree of 
              freedom robots with work volumes in a range from 0.5 millimeter to  0.5
              centimeter on a side.  The robots will be fabricated using  existing
              micromachining technology developed for the micro sensor  industry and micro
              electromechanical systems research.  The robots  will be built as complete
              units, with all of the sensors, motors,  and mechanisms integrated into the
              same process.  No assembly of  separate components will be required.  The
              robots will be  capable of sub-micron positioning accuracy, which will be 
              demonstrated by using a robot to probe a working integrated  circuit.  The
              robots will also be capable of carrying small  payloads, on the order of one
              half of a millimeter on a side, which  will be demonstrated by manipulation of
              small opto-electronics  components such as laser diodes.  This work will have
              immediate  applications in integrated circuit manufacturing and testing, 
              biomedical sample preparation and analysis, and material handling  and
              characterization on a micron and submicron scale.
