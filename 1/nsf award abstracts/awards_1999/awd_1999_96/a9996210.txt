Abstract    :
                  Shors  9511027    The learning process can be influenced profoundly by other
              events in an organism's life.  For example, stress can either facilitate or
              impair the learning process, depending upon the properties of the stressor and
              the type of learning being considered.  With this award, Dr. Tracey Shors will
              examine a model-system in which mild stress facilitates acquisition of a
              learned response.  In particular, she will determine if this facilitation is
              dependent upon a region of the brain, the hippocampus, where the
              neurotransmitter glutamate seems to play a role in learning related processes. 
              This work will provide insights into some of the neurochemical and synaptic
              mechanisms of learning facilitation.  It will have impact on theories in
              biology and education about how "non-learners" can be encouraged to become
              "learners".   ***
