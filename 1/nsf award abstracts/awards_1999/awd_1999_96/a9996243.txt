Abstract    :
              9619191  Hollingsworth    The focus of this proposal entitled Cooperative
              Phenomena  and Domain Switching Processes in Organic Inclusion  Compounds  is
              on a molecular understanding of cooperative  interactions in solids, and in
              particular on the design,  synthesis and characterization of a series of
              inclusion  compounds that undergo macroscopic domain reorientation  under
              applied anisotropic stress (ferroelasticity).  The  research program  will
              address on a molecular level what it  is that controls domain switching
              processes in crystals,  what are the mechanisms of ferroelasticity, and what
              the  rate determining steps are.  Because ferroelasticity and  ferroelectricity
              are so closely related, the emphasis on  cooperative determinants of
              ferroelastic properties should  provide important insights into the domain
              switching  processes in ferroelectric materials.  %%%  The design and synthesis
              of ferroelectric inclusion  compounds will provide new materials, which because
              of their  fast timescale for guest molecular reorientation, should  make them
              of high interest  as rapidly switching  electrooptical materials.  ***
