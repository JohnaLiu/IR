Abstract    :
              With its exponential parallelism, molecular computing offers  the hope of
              solving important problems that have resisted  solution on conventional
              computers. Various molecular  operations have been proposed as feasible;
              because it is  unclear which operations will be usefully implementable, 
              algorithms that use the simplest operations are to be  preferred. In
              particular, communication between processes  may be impossible. Parallelism and
              running time are  resources to be exploited efficiently. It is known that 
              molecular computers with limited operations sets, polynomial  time, and
              exponential parallelism can solve any problem in  the class NP. By further
              limiting the parallelism, various  bounded-nondeterminism subclasses of NP are
              obtained. This  project investigates the relationships among molecular 
              computation classes and these NP subclasses. While many  molecular algorithms
              for important problems use 2n  parallelism, this severely limits the size of
              problems that  those algorithms can solve.  In the last two decades there  has
              been an improvement from 2n to 2cn for various c<1 in  the running time of
              classical serial algorithms for  important NP-complete problems like 3-SAT,
              graph coloring,  and independent set. Using bounded nondeterminism as an 
              algorithm design technique, this project will develop more  efficient molecular
              algorithms for important NP-complete  problems, such as 3-SAT, graph coloring,
              and independent  set.  ***
