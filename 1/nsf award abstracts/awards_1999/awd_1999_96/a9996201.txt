Abstract    :
              The major part of this research is concerned with the further  development and
              use of the Diaz-Gimenez, Prescott, et al applied  general-equilibrium framework
              to evaluate monetary and fiscal  policy rules.  The thesis underlying this
              research program is  that the standard assumption that financial markets are
              costless  to operate is not a reasonable one when it comes to evaluating 
              monetary and fiscal stabilization policies.  In the framework  being developed,
              young households borrow to finance houses and  businesses.  The old, who have
              saved for their retirement, lend  to the intermediaries.  Borrowing and lending
              rates differ by a  large amount as in fact on average they do.  Preliminary
              results  are that the effects of public consumption shocks are much larger  in
              such worlds than in the standard real business cycle model.  Another dimension
              where the behavior of this model differs from  that of the standard real
              business cycle model with money  introduced via the cash-credit good constraint
              is that there can  be large and highly persistent deviations from the empirical
               demand for money relationship.  The other part of the research  proposal is to
              determine whether corporate takeovers, or some  takeover like arrangement, are
              necessary for economic efficiency.
