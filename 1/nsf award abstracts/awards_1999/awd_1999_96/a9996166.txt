Abstract    :
                This project is a pilot study focusing on the way aversive or modern racism
              effects capital jury deliberations.  Sixty six-person, death qualified students
              and an additional sixty six-person, death qualified juries of community
              residents of San Jose, CA will serve as participants.  Stimulus case materials
              will vary the race of defendants and the race of victim.  Deliberations will be
              videotaped and coded.  The pilot work will allow the PI to test her procedures
              and to arrange for data collection from other locations.  The PI will develop a
              full proposal from the data she collects.  The PI is a beginning investigator.
