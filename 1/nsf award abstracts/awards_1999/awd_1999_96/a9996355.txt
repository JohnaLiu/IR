Abstract    :
                Lips  9807583    Between 1990-97 the PI has observed the sudden and
              unexplained  decline of the riparian anurans at two remote, protected sites in 
              montane Central America. Causes of these declines are unknown, but  based on
              over five years of personal observations, demographic  data, and results of
              autopsies on dead frogs (by D. E. Green), the  PI hypothesizes that these two
              declines may be attributed to two  microbial pathogens: a fungus, and a virus.
              The PI suggests that  these two sites were affected by the same agent as that
              which  decimated the amphibians of Monteverde, Costa Rica, and that the 
              sequential disappearance of amphibians at these three sites over  the past 10
              years is evidence of a highly contagious pathogen  moving through the Central
              American isthmus.    The PI will propose to organize a multidisciplinary Rapid
              Response  and Assessment Team that would attempt to jump ahead of this 
              apparent "front" of amphibian mortality. The team would survey the  health of
              both the amphibian fauna and the environment to document  the changes in each
              during a decline. Likely members would include  herpetologists, pathologists,
              toxicologists, and endocrinologists,  parasitologists, and epidemiologists. 
              The team would survey these sites in a systematic way to determine  the
              mechanisms of amphibian  declines by surveying all life stages, measuring
              environmental  factors thought to cause or contribute to declines, and
              collecting  individuals for full medical diagnostic evaluations.  The team
              would determine the geographic extent of this decline in  Central and South
              America by surveying select upland areas where  declines have occurred, and
              where declines are expected to occur.
