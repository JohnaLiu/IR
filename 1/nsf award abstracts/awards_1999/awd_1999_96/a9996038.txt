Abstract    :
              The PIs wish to study wave propagation and dissipation in solar  coronal loops,
              and their consequences for coronal heating.  In  particular, they will focus on
              the consistency of coronal wave  heating models with the observed high degree
              of localization and  intermittency of coronal x-ray emission.  Specific goals
              are:  (1)  investigating the magnetohydrodynamic wave transmission from the 
              photosphere to the corona in a realistic magnetic field geometry,  (2)
              analyzing the eigenmode spectrum of the coronal loop beyond the 
              magnetohydrodynamic approximation, taking into account the presence  of the
              equilibrium current, and (3) considering the anomalous wave  dissipation that
              leads to localization and intermittency consistent  with the observations.***
