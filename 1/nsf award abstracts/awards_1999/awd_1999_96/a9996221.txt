              ABSTRACT    96-15941  Bever  Competition and coexistence: The role of soil
              community feedback    This study will examine how feedback through the soil
              community changes the outcome of competition between plants. The identity of
              plant species is known to change the composition of their associated soil
              community. These changes may then influence the plant's performance-either
              positively or negatively. Such feedback could exert strong effects on the
              growth of plants, but the role of such feedbacks in natural communities has
              rarely been investigated. This project focuses on two well-studied plant
              species, Anthoxanthum odoratum and Panicum sphaerocarpon. The investigators
              have repeatedly observed negative feedbacks between these two species resulting
              from changes in the soil communities. This project will using parallel
              greenhouse and field experiments to test whether this feedback influences the
              outcome and intensity of competition between these species. These results will
              be used to parameterize population dynamic models with which the investigators
              will evaluate the soil community's contribution to the maintenance of plant
              biodiversity.
