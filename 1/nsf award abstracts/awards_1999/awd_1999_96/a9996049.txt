Abstract    :
              Hsu    9723203  Technical Section  The flexibility and adaptivity of the
              vertebrate immune system to the environment is based on the extraordinarily
              wide diversity of the cell surface receptors that mediate immune function. In
              vertebrates,  large multigene families and a unique mechanism of recombination
              brings together different gene segments that are expressed in lymphocytes. In
              the living representatives of the earliest vertebrates,  the jawless fishes and
              in the jawed cartilaginous fishes, it is not clear if expression is dependent
              on gene rearrangement in the latter or if a multigene family exists in the
              former. The specific aims of this work are: to   isolate VH-like sequences from
              jawless fish by the new PCR approach developed in this laboratory in order to
              identify a multigene family encoding lymphocyte cell receptors in
              representatives of the most primitive vertebrates,  to compare the expression
              of the shark joined and unjoined IG genes in order to determine the role of the
              recombination process in Ig expression in jawed vertebrates, and to investigate
              the regulation of IG expression in sharks with respect to allelic/isotype
              exclusion, in order to determine if the lymphocytes are polyspecific.   
              Non-technical section  The proposed experiments will expand our insight into
              the existence and role of multigene families and the rearrangement process in
              the representatives of the earliest vertebrates and allow a better
              understanding of how the modern, adaptive immune system evolved specific,
              clonal recognition of pathogenic non-self.  ***
