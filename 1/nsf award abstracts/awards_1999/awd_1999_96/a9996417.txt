Abstract    :
              ***  9629152  Chen   The major research thrust for the awardee during the period
              of this award will be to investigate an innovative approach that might enable
              revolutionary advances in microprocessor-based digital circuit simulation for
              design and real-time control of advanced manufacturing systems.  The core of
              the hardware-based simulator is a microprocessor-based digital circuit board
              that is comprised of a collection of "micro control boxes" mimicking the
              complete array of machinery and equipment of a flexible manufacturing system
              such as workcenters, transporters, and load/unload stations.  For each micro
              control box, the operating logic of the designated resource
              (equipment/machinery) such as processing times for different parts, expected
              breakdown frequency and recovery time will be captured via micro-programs. By
              using microprocessors for each of the resources, a printed circuit board (PCB)
              can be designed and built to represent the total functions and operating
              conditions of a flexible manufacturing system.  A laboratory flexible
              manufacturing system will be acquired and implemented at the early stage of the
              project to serve as an experimental testbed for the development of the proposed
              hardware-based simulator.      If successful, results of this research will
              advance simulation technology for real-time control and optimization of
              advanced manufacturing systems.  This research will also assist agile and lean
              production processes.  This technology could become an integrated tool to
              realize the virtual reality (VR) manufacturing technologies now being tested by
              a few pioneering applications.  ***
