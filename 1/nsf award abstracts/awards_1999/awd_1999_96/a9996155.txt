Abstract    :
              HUNEKE,  97-31512        This award supports research  in commutative algebra
              and algebraic geometry.  The principal investigator will continue to
              investigate a group of long  standing questions centered around the process of
              reduction to positive  characteristic, especially in regard to the developing
              theory of tight  closure.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the
              relationship between  tight closure, reduction to positive characteristic, and
              vanishing  theorems in algebraic geometry such as the Kodaira vanishing
              theorem.  Closely related work will be done on questions concerning uniform 
              bounds in Noetherian rings, and in particular on the uniform Artin-Rees 
              conjectures.      This is research in the closely related fields of commutative
              algebra and  algebraic geometry. In essence these fields are quite similar to
              the  19th century study of equations and their solutions.  The relationship 
              between algebraic equations, such as polynomial equations, and geometry  goes
              back at least to Descartes and the idea of coordinatizing the plane. 
              Commutative algebra studies the solutions of such polynomial or power  series
              equations by forming an algebraic object, called a ring, which  consists of the
              'generic' solutions.  The algebraic properties of  these generic solutions then
              give insight into the geometric and algebraic  nature of the equations. The
              field combines techniques from a number of  other areas including
              combinatorics, topology, and analysis.
