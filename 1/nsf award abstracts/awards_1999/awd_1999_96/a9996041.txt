Abstract    :
              The early 18th century origins of modern automation pose a problem for the
              history of ideas as well as for the history of techniques.  At the beginning of
              that century projects in mechanization were mostly amusements, such as
              decorated music boxes and ringing mechanisms on clocks.  The in the first
              decades of the century, automata-makers began to apply their art to the
              resolution of philosophical problems.  By the end of the century the problems
              they studied were predominantly industrial.  Paralleling this move of
              mechanization from popular amusement to philosophy to industry, a modern
              conception of automation developed from an initial diversity of artistic,
              philosophical and experimental devices.    The proposed research will begin an
              investigation of this transformation, using primary and secondary materials
              located predominantly in Paris, France, and at the Smithsonian Institution in
              Washington, D.C.
