ABSTRACT
 
The PI plans to study finite dimensional normed spaces
              and 
convex bodies using methods of Fourier analysis. The idea is 
to express
              different properties of convex bodies in terms of 
the Fourier transform and
              then solve geometric problems using 
Fourier analytic methods. This approach
              has already led to 
several results including the Fourier transform formulae
              for 
the volume of sections of star bodies and a complete analytic 
solution
              to the Busemann-Petty problem on sections of convex 
bodies. The emphasis is
              on developing new connections between
the Fourier transform and parallel
              section functions (X-rays) 
of convex bodies that will lead to new information
              about the 
structure of subspaces of Banach spaces, geometric properties 
of
              certain classes of convex bodies. The results will also be 
applied to the
              study of positive definite norm dependent functions 
(theorems of Schoenberg's
              type) and their connections with stable 
and isotropic stochastic processes.
              


This research will provide new connections between several areas
              of
mathematics and engineering. Many of the results will have
              equivalent
formulations in the languages of functional analysis, geometry
              and
harmonic analysis. The study of subspaces of normed spaces is
              closely
related to geometric tomography. The classical problem is to
              determine
certain geometric properties of a solid by means of the areas of
              its
slices obtained with differently placed sources of X-rays. The
              Fourier
transform approach will contribute to this important problem in
              medical
engineering. An application to statistics is the study of
              different
parameters of stochastic processes under restricted data. An
              important
example is the problem of determining the main frequences of a
              signal
when only the maximal amplitude can be measured. New techniques
              for
calculating the Fourier transform will serve as an important tool
and
              will have other applications to signal processing.
