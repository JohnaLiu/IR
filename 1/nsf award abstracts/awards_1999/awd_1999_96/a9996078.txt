Abstract    :
                        9730183  Buium        In previous research, Buium investigated an
              analogue of algebraic geometry in which algebraic equations are replaced by
              algebraic differential equations. This geometry may be called differential
              algebraic geometry, and its commutative algebra counterpart is the Ritt-Kolchin
              differential algebra. Applications of Buium's work include the ``effective
              geometric Lang conjecture.'' In subsequent research, Buium developed an
              arithmetic analogue of differential algebraic geometry. Applications of the
              latter included a proof of the "effective Manin-Mumford conjecture" and an
              arithmetic analogue of Manin's theorem of the Kernel. The main theme of this
              project will be continuing this line of investigation, especially in the
              arithmetic direction.        This is research in the field of algebraic
              geometry. Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics,
              but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.
              In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined  in the plane by the
              simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods
              not only from algebra,  but from analysis and topology, and conversely is
              finding  application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical 
              computer science, and robotics.
