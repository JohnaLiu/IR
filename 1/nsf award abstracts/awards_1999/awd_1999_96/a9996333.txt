Abstract    :
              9710146  Scholz         This program is a core project of IDEAL, the
              International  Decade for the East African Lakes.  The project will conduct an 
              intermediate-resolution seismic reflection site survey of Lake  Edward, in the
              northern part of the western branch of the East  African Rift, in anticipation
              of subsequent drilling.  The primary  goal of the drilling program is to
              chronicle a quantitative high-  resolution paleoclimate and paleolimnological
              history of the basin  and surrounding region at 0o-1o S latitude on the East
              African  plateau, extending back through at least two glacial-interglacial 
              cycles.  Ancillary goals include answering fundamental questions in  the ares
              of extensional tectonics, and evolutionary biology and  macroecology in
              continental rifts.         The principal objectives of this seismic-reflection
              pre-  drilling site survey are to 1) develop a robust sequence- and 
              chron-stratigraphic framework for the upper 1000, of sedimentary  section in
              this half-graben basin, 2) acquire a grid of high-  quality,
              intermediate-resolution multichannel and single-channel  seismic reflection
              data for siting one or more drill holes in the  basin, 3) characterize the
              deformational fabric of the uppermost  crust, and 4) determine the total
              sediment thickness and depth to  syn-rift basement in the basin.  Important
              issues to be considered  through interpretation of the seismic data set include
              developing  a relative lake level curve for the basin; determining which areas 
              of the lake are likely to contain continuous stratigraphic records;  and
              assessing the intrabasinal deformational fabric for helping  determine
              extension direction in the East African Rift.   Integrating the seismic data
              with the drill hole data sets will  permit the development of quantitative,
              high-resolution models of  lacustrine rift basin evolution.         Since the
              primary drilling objectives are focused toward  paleoclimate studies and
              limited to 100-500 m, and a vessel must be  transported to the lake for the 
              survey, an intermediate-resolution  survey will be carried out using a small
              air gun seismic source and  a short (300-600 m) seismic streamer, to acquire ~
              1500 km of data  and image to a depth of ~ 1000 m.  ***
