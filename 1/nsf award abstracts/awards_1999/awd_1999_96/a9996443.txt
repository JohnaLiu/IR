Abstract    :
              9623037  Gamba       This proposal concerns problems that model potential 
              compressible    fluid flow and charged-particle transport systems. The 
              compressible fluid     flow models  under  consideration  include the standard 
               transonic  flow      problem  in  gas  dynamics, its  viscous  approximations
              and   boundary      value problem,  and the  Mach  reflection problem  when  a 
               weak shock     (pressure) wave  collides  with an oblique obstacle. Models of 
              charged-    particle transport systems are  studied  within the framework  of 
              submicron      electronic  devices. In  particular  these models  include  
              electro-    hydrodynamic  or  energy-transport models  for semiconductors, 
              related     models for  plasmas,  boundary  value  problems and their high 
              field     approximations.   %%%       Areas of applications of the proposed
              research include  models in     aerodynamics and aircraft  design.  In 
              particular,  wing    performance just below supersonic speeds and wing design
              for  flight     in the upper atmosphere. These are  models  that describe how a
               gas    moves around an object at high speeds (i.e. close to producing  sonic
              booms).     In addition models of ionized plasmas and electron transport  are
              considered.      In particular, the design and  performance simulation of 
              semiconductor     devices of extremely small size and even quantum level. The 
              models      under consideration  describe the flow of current in the  working
              of a     submicron or a quantum-scale electronic device. The core of the 
              proposal      focuses on issues related to  questions of validity and  
              stability of models      based on the available data. This information is of
              paramount  importance in      finding  the   best computational strategy for
              the computer  aided     simulation of experiments.   ***
