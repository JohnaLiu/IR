Abstract    :
              Dixon's formulation for simultaneously eliminating several  variables from a
              system of multivariate polynomial equations will  be investigated. Solving
              polynomials equations and identifying  conditions on parameters under which the
              equations have common  solutions are fundamental problems in symbolic
              computations which  arise almost everywhere. Polynomials are used to model many
               phenomena - particularly in robotics, kinematics, computer  vision, solid
              modeling, graphics, chemical equilibrium and other  engineering, CAD-CAM
              design, etc.  Dixon's formulation directly  generalizes Bezout-Cayley's
              formulation of a resultant for  eliminating a single variable. Dixon resultants
              have not been  extensively investigated apparently because they presumably got 
              overshadowed by Macaulay's formulation of resultants for  simultaneously
              eliminating several variables.  Implementations of  Dixon resultants, Macaulay
              resultants and sparse resultants  have revealed that Dixon resultants are more
              efficient to  compute in practice.  Dixon resultants will be analyzed with a 
              particular emphasis on studying the relationship of the size and  structure of
              the Dixon matrix to the input polynomial system.  ***
