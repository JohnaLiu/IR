Abstract    :
              9702474  Wilson  Our research focuses on modelling both the function and
              architecture of biological olfaction   in developing practical chemical sensing
              Microsystems.  The research is integrated with   teaching efforts via
              traditional senior-level courses taught in the area and in a novel outreach  
              to elementary-level students in Central Kentucky.  Interactive demonstrations
              will be developed   for the elementary level student that link the physical
              (engineering) sciences with biological   sciences via our research in
              biologically-inspired, artificial sensing systems.  ***
