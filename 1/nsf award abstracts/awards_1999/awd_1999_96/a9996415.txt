Landscape and Environment in the Organization of Aleut
              Society: Behavioral Responses to Catastrophic Change in Coastal Regions

The
              lower Alaska Peninsula is one of the most dynamic landscapes on earth.  Recent
              research has resulted in a nearly continuous record of prehistoric Aleut
              settlement spanning the last 6000 years.  Regional changes in the organization
              of villages, households, economy, and material culture reflect relationships
              between a dynamic and evolving landscape, climate change, and culture change. 
              This diachronic and synchronic archaeological research on the relationship
              between catastrophic changes in coastal ecosystems and human responses to those
              changes includes an excavation program for selected villages on the Morzhovoi
              Bay/Morzhovoi Lake area of the lower Alaska Peninsula.  The data will be used
              to test a number of hypotheses about the relationships between catastrophic
              environmental changes on the one hand, and the structure of marine-based
              economies, social organization, and regional interaction
