Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to investigate the fundamental physical
              mechanisms of substorms and associated particle entry by means of 3-D
              electromagnetic particle simulations with time-varying solar wind parameters. 
              The 3-D EM particle simulations self-consistently include microscopic kinetic
              effects and can thus provide insight into important basic problems such as
              reconnection, tail current evolution and instabilities, and the spatial
              development of the substorm.
