Abstract    :
              Bartl  MCB-9629300  Recombination activating genes (RAG-1 and RAG-2) are
              essential for gene rearrangement in mammals.  Previously isolated PCR products
              from nurse shark DNA that have sequence similarity to mammalian RAG-1 genes
              will be used to screen a genomic library.  Since mammalian, avian and amphibian
              RAG-1 and RAG-2 are tightly linked, the same may be true of the shark homologs.
               Genomic clones containing shark RAG-1 will be assayed for linked RAG-2
              homologs using PCR, heterologous probes or by searching for an open-reading
              frame.  Following the proposed planning period, the shark RAG-1 and RAG-2
              homologs will be used to assay expression in lymphoid organs from nurse sharks
              of different ages using Northern blots and in situ hybridization. 
              Recombination activity of shark RAG proteins will be assessed in mammalian
              fibroblasts using artificial substrates.  The immune system of higher
              vertebrates is a complex network of cells, organs and tissues.  The intricate
              workings and the evolution of such a tightly linked system are not well
              understood.  A basic process required for immune function is the rearrangement
              of subgenic elements to form functional antigen receptors.  Elucidating the
              mechanism in organisms distantly related to mammals is crucial for our
              understanding of the evolution of adaptive immunity.  For the proposed research
              plan, shark is selected because they are the taxon most distantly related to
              mammals in which an adaptive immune system has been documented.
