Abstract    :
              Abstract  CTS 96-18433  Dellinger     This is a study of the mechanism of
              formation of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDD) polychlorinated
              dibenzofurans (PCDF), and related compounds (collectively PCDD/F). Previous
              work haq shown the process to be catalyzed by fly ash in the range of
              250-400(C.  Transition metals such as iron and copper also seem to catalyze the
              formation of these materials.  A search for evidence of surface mediated
              reactions tests a hypothetical mechanism for the process.  Samples containing
              various combinations of silicate and alumina glasses (surrogates for fly ash),
              organic precursors (chlorobenzenes, phenol, and other aromatic compounds), and
              chlorinating agents (chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and transition metal
              chlorides) are prepared using resistively heated wafers in a special adsorption
              cell.  Chemisorption, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray
              photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy
              (LIF), micro-Raman spectroscopy, and other instrumental and wet chemical
              techniques are used to probe reaction intermediates. From these data, an
              elementary chemical reaction and kinetic model for the formation of PCDD/F is
              developed.   Elimination of emissions containing polychlorinated dibenzodioxins
              and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) from combustion sources is among the most pressing
              of environmental issues.  An improved understanding of the origin and mechanism
              of formation of PCDD/F may lead to a strategy to avoid their formation by
              process modification (pollution prevention), obviating the need for
              post-process control measures.
