Abstract    :
              9629353  Middleton     Computer models of past, present and future atmospheric
              chemistry conditions and air quality scenarios rely on inventories that are
              constructed on appropriate spatial and temporal scales and incorporate relevant
              chemical species.  The development and distribution of global inventories is
              the key function of the Global Emissions Inventory Activity (GEIA) of the
              International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project (IGAC).  The ultimate goal
              of GEIA is to establish emission inventories for all trace tropospheric
              chemical species, incorporating fluxes from both anthropogenic and natural
              sources.   Research conducted under this award will support the development of
              global inventories.  Management and distribution of GEIA inventories are
              primary tasks to be conducted.  Inventory development will be supported by
              providing travel funds for participation in GEIA working groups by emissions
              inventory  experts.  The data bases will be maintained by the GEIA Data
              Management and Information Exchange Center and the resulting products,
              periodically updated as appropriate, are expected to become standard
              inventories for the international atmospheric chemistry community. All GEIA
              inventories are available electronically to interested users upon request.
