This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              applied mathematics involves Gang Bao, William Hager and Shari Moskow of the
              University of Florida and H. Ammari and J.C. Nedelec of the Ecole
              Polytechnique.  The investigators propose to examine mathematical issues and
              develop computational methods for solving problems in modeling and design of
              micro diffractive optics.  Micro diffractive optics is a fundamental, emerging
              technology in which optical devices are micromachined with very small
              structural features.  Diffractive optical structures perform functions
              unattainable with conventional optics.  In developing these mathematical
              models, the investigators will attempt to describe accurately the diffraction
              of complicated structures; to compute the electromagnetic vector fields; and 
              to predict the performance of a given diffractive structure in linear and
              nonlinear optical media.  The models may enable optimal design of new optical
              structures.

The US investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in
              the applied mathematical aspects of micro diffractive optics.  French expertise
              in theory and their computational work in wave propagation complement the US
              effort.  The project will advance understanding of mathematical models and
              analysis as applied to optics and may lead to the development of new optical
              devices for the telecommunication and information technology sectors.
