Abstract    :
              9711885  Smith    This research makes methodological and substantive
              contributions to dynamic game theory and learning theory.  It seeks to attain
              unmet goals of explaining observed features of bargaining - offers are
              concessions, timing of offers is unrestricted, the process itself is a war of
              attrition - in a perfect information framework.  It achieves a characterization
              of the "recursive" sequential equilibrium payoff set, and later a folk theorem
              for games with hidden actions and no summary public statistic.  It pushes as
              far as possible the methodology introduced by Abreu, Pearce, and Stacchetti of
              reducing a dynamic game to a one-shot "auxiliary game."  It explores a new
              conjecture about optimal experimentation - that information demand is
              quasiconcave in the posterior beliefs.  The model offers a simple framework for
              exploring the stochastic evolution of research expenditures on a given project.
               It is conceptually similar to both game theory projects in the attempt to
              understand intertemporal dynamics by carefully analyzing the cross-section of
              possible continuation "games."  Understanding the dynamics of private
              information is one of the single most important outstanding problems facing
              game theory and, to a lesser extent, contract theory.   This research will open
              up a very large class of models that economists currently simply cannot solve. 
              It also offers a simple and substantive new pure theory of dynamic R&D founded
              on dynamic experimentation.
