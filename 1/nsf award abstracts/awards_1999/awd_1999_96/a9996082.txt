Abstract    :
              9734103  Interactive steering permits users to monitor a program's  execution
              and adjust application parameters and resource  allocation in an online
              fashion. Steering tools must address  issues related to the consistency, lag,
              scalability, and induced  perturbation of monitoring, display, and interaction
              components.  However, the ideal balance among these concerns varies with 
              execution environment and target application. Thus,  configurability is an
              important issue. This research focuses on  the design and development of
              infrastructure for a steering  environment that permits users to specify the
              configuration to  provide the desired balance among consistency, lag, and 
              perturbation. This project includes the development of modular  algorithms for
              the collection of snapshots with varying degrees  of consistency, and
              algorithms that permit the consistent  application of changes to the executing
              program, while minimizing  resulting lag and perturbation. These algorithms for
              consistent  monitoring and steering build on existing work on snapshot 
              algorithms, and extend this work from the realm of consistent  observation of
              distributed systems to ensuring consistency in the  application of changes to
              an executing distributed computation,  through an innovative application of
              optimistic computing  techniques.  Another interesting feature of this work is
              the use  of monitoring and steering ``agents'', implemented as scripts,  and
              deployed in a modular, hierarchical monitoring and steering  environment.***
