Abstract    :
              9706388  McNutt    One of the outstanding problems in continental tectonics is
              the  deep structure of continental strike-slip faults.  By simple  oceanic
              analogy, they might be vertical fault planes cutting the  entire  lithosphere
              and providing a sharp focus for strain between  drifting plates.  On the other
              hand, they may sole out into  dipping detachments in the lower crust that
              decouple the motions  mapped from surface geology and geodesy from those in the
              deeper  mantle lithosphere.  To distinguish between these two end-member 
              models, the PI will conduct a gravity survey of two long transects  across the
              Altyn Tagh, a major continental strike-slip fault  separating the Tibet Plateau
              from the Tarim Basin in southwestern  China.  The large topographic relief
              across this fault makes it  the ideal place to use very simple gravimetric
              techniques to  determine whether or not the Altyn Tagh cuts the mantle 
              lithosphere and what is the state of stress on the fault.  ***
