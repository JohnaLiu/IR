Abstract    :
              Fritz  9707689         Diatom species distributions are highly correlated with 
              ionic concentration (salinity) and lakewater anion  composition, and it is
              these correlations that form the  foundation for the use of diatoms as tools
              for climate  reconstruction.  However, the actual mechanisms behind these 
              associations are unknown.  Salinity may influences diatom  physiology directly,
              by exerting an osmotic stress, or  salinity may interact with other factors and
              thus indirectly  affect species composition.  Nutrient concentration and 
              ratios frequently control primary production and algal  community structure in
              lacustrine systems, and in saline  lakes salinity and anion composition may
              influence nutrient  availability to primary producers, as well as nutrient 
              requirements and uptake by diatoms.  Thus here we propose a  series of
              laboratory experiments  to test the effect of  salinity and anion composition
              on the outcome of nutrient  competition between diatoms.
