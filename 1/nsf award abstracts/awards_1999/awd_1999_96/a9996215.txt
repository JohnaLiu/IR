Abstract    :
              9522201  Chou  The research uses nanofabrication which employs ultra-high
              resolution e-beam lithography, RIE and the integration of other
              nanotechnologies to realize unique and novel device structures.  The emphasis
              is on improving the e-beam lithography system and examining new RIE etches to
              define nanostructures with sub-10 nm dimensions.  The research addresses three
              nanostructures:  (1) Si quantum-Dot transistors operating at room temperature,
              (2) ultrafast Si MSM photodetectors and (3) high-speed optical receivers using
              MSM PD's and sub-100 nm Si MOSFETs.  In order to realize these structures the
              e-beam diameter will be reduced from 4 nm to 2.5 nm by replacing their tungsten
              filament with a LB6 filament, the system noise will be reduced and the
              accelerating voltage will be increased from 40 KeV to 50 KeV.  Inorganic
              resists will be examined for sub 10 nm feature sizes along with chlorine-based
              RIE processes.  ***
