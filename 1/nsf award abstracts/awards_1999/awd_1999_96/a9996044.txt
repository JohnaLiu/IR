Abstract    :
              This   research   explores  inductive  machine   learning   using  mathematical 
               optimization   as   a   foundation.   Optimization  techniques  such  as
              linear and nonlinear programming  have  been  shown  to  be  effective  in
              solving error-minimization  problems  inherent  in  inductive learning.  This
              work builds upon  such  a  system,  MSM-T,  that  constructs multivariate 
              oblique  decision  trees.  This  system  is  used as a platform  for  research 
              into  learning  issues such as overtraining avoidance.  In  particular,  new 
              methods for feature selection, node splitting, and  overflow  avoidance  are 
              being  incorporated into MSM-T. These  techniques  are  intended to optimize
              the generalization performance  of  the  system in high-variance learning
              situations such as feature noise  and  sparse, high-dimensional feature sets. 
              The results of  this  work  will  be  used  in  applications in medical 
              diagnosis  and  prognosis that require efficient programs for learning from
              large  volumes  of data.  In addition, research in machine learning  and 
              medical  decision making will be incorporated into  the  computer  science
              curriculum at Oklahoma State University, as part  of  the  CAREER activity.
