Abstract    :
              9633510   CAPONE    N2 Fixation as a Source of New N in the Oligotrophic
              Tropical Oceans    This project will examine the importance of the
              nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, Trichodesmium, in providing nitrogen to support
              biological production in tropical oceans. Nitrogen (N2) fixing bacteria are
              intensively studied worldwide, particularly in agricultural systems, reflecting
              their importance as sources of fertilizer nitrogen. Trichodesmium, the best
              known marine nitrogen fixer, is widely distributed throughout the tropical
              oceans, can form massive blooms, and possesses a number of unique metabolic
              adaptations for fixing nitrogen. Global nitrogen fixation by Trichodesmium may
              rival that in agricultural systems. Recent evidence indicates that the rate of
              nitrogen fixation by Trichodesmium has been severely underestimated, and this
              may account for the severe imbalances in the nitrogen budgets of several
              tropical oceanic biomes. This research will provide fundamental information on
              the physiology of Trichodesmium, will quantify its importance in the global
              carbon and nitrogen cycles, and will yield information to more accurately
              assess the biological capacity of tropical oceans to take up atmospheric carbon
              dioxide.
