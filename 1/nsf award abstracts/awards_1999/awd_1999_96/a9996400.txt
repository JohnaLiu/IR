Abstract    :
              This CAREER award to Omar Yaghi at Arizona State University is supported   by
              the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division. The research   is
              aimed at developing and understanding new synthetic methods for the  
              construction of crystalline solid-state materials from purely inorganic  
              building blocks. The research will focus on utilizing transition metal   and
              main group oxide cages and cage aggregates in polymerization   reactions to
              produce porous materials that have diverse  pore size, shape   and function.
              Cationic, anionic and neutral, open-frameworks will be   synthesized having
              channels where guest molecules may reside.  Molecular   aggregates will be used
              as guests to prevent interpenetration of porous   networks.  The presence of
              weak interactions with the aggregates will   facilitate evacuation of the
              channels, leading to high mobility of the   guest species.  Zeolites and other
              porous materials have had an enormous   impact on the global economy, for
              example in catalysis and separations.   This study will advance our
              understanding of inclusion phenomena and lead   to diverse compositions with
              larger channels and  enhanced properties.  Through the CAREER plan,
              undergraduates, graduate students and precollege   teachers will participate in
              the above research with specific projects   directed at their needs and
              experience. Emphasis will be on solution and   solid-phase synthetic
              techniques, computer graphics and literature   searching. An introductory level
              course will be developed using case   studies as a teaching tool to highlight
              chemical concepts. An industrial   exchange program will also be instituted
              which will permit up to three   students per year to work with a company having
              interests in porous   solids.
