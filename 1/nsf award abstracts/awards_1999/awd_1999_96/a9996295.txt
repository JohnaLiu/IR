Abstract    :
              9422795  Bernstein  This project analyzes a type of law that has become very
              important in the business economy of the United States, but that has been
              largely ignored by legal scholars:  private commercial law developed by trade
              associations and enforced through association-run arbitration tribunals.  This
              private law exists in a wide variety of industries such as grain, textiles, 
              rubber, movies, and diamonds.  It is embodied in detailed rules and standard
              form contracts that cover most of the same aspects of commercial transactions
              as the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).  These rules are supplemented by customs
              and usages of trade as well as by industry specific ethical codes that set out
              standards defining proper commercial behavior.  These standards are similar to
              the UCC's obligations of good faith and fair dealing, but tend to be far more
              specific.  The tribunals that enforce these rules operate under detailed
              procedural codes.  This project will explore why these private legal systems
              developed and endured.  In addition to in-depth case studies of several private
              law systems, the project will create a data base of trade rules, standard form
              contracts, ethical rules, association bylaws, and procedural rules, as well as
              information about the associations obtained through interviews.  It will seek
              to establish the substance and extent of private commercial law and compare and
              contrast this law with the formal commercial law produced by the state.  The
              analysis will be presented in a book entitled THE NEWEST LAW MERCHANT:  PRIVATE
              COMMERCIAL LAW IN THE UNITED STATES.  It will focus on the reasons for the
              development of the private law systems, the costs and benefits associated with
              their use, and the mechanisms through which the enforcing tribunals achieve
              compliance with their rulings without recourse to the courts.  It will thus
              make a contribution to understanding dispute resolution in the United States in
              both the private and public spheres.  %%%%  This project analyzes a type of law
