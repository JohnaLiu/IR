Abstract    :
              OCE 96-18102  Tandon    The project will evaluate the contribution of diurnal
              and  seasonal cycling of the mixed layer to the transformation of  water masses
              in the upper ocean.  This represents an  extension of the steady thermodynamic
              balance where the air-  sea buoyancy flux is compensated by vertical mixing in
              the  surface mixed layer and the advective buoyancy flux. In this  study the
              diapycnal flux due to time-dependent (diurnal and  seasonal) mixed layer
              deepening and entrainment will be  quantified. Both data analysis and
              diagnostic studies of  model output will be used in the investigation.
