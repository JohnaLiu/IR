Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative effort among the two-and four-year public and
              independent colleges in Oregon to promote reform in the teaching and learning
              of mathematics and the sciences in the preparation of teachers of science and
              mathematics for grades K - 12. The project will strengthen the curriculum,
              field and other out-of-class experiences , and selected science, mathematics
              and education courses so as to reflect current research on teaching and
              learning and to encourage cross disciplinary conversation.  Science,
              mathematics, and education courses will be designed to be consistent with NCTM
              and Science Standards and will be developed within the context of improving the
              institutions' program for prospective teachers.  The project will also stress
              recruitment and retention of promising students in the teaching profession,
              with particular attention to students from underrepresented groups.  Further,
              the project will establish mechanisms to enable the science, mathematics and
              engineering faculty and mentor teachers to learn about and implement new
              techniques in pedagogy.
