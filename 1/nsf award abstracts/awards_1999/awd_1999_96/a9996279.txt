Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT        This is a joint proposal to support the Ocean-Atmosphere-Ice
              Interactions (OAII) Science Management Office (SMO) and Science Steering
              Committee (SSC).  The SMO will be located at ODU and the chair of the SSC will
              be at UT.  The SMO will support the activities of the OAII SSC (e.g. workshops,
              planning meetings, and coordination with international science projects),
              publish a newsletter, promote correspondence of OAII results at national
              meetings and between PIs, facilitate logistical arrangements, and promote
              integration of OAII activities with other components of the Arctic System
              Science (ARCSS) Program.  The SSC will conduct planning meetings for future
              OAII science projects, appoint working groups to conduct workshops for
              development of science plans for new initiatives, and provide the ARCSS Program
              with an assessment on priorities for OAII global change initiatives/projects in
              the Arctic that are developed through the workshops.
