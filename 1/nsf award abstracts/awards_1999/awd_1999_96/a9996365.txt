Abstract    :
                ABSTRACT    Costin    Costin will work on constructing a theory of analyzable
              functions.   Obtained by taking a closure of analytic functions with respect to
                function operations (algebraic operations, including division,   composition,
              differentiation, integration, etc.) they preserve many   analytic function
              properties, including unique representation by   expansions (formalizability)
              and permanence of relations. In addition  to the intrinsic interest in
              exploring the limits of formalizability,   there is a major practical interest
              in reconstructing actual   solutions from formal expansions for a wide class of
              equations.   A complete theory of analyzable functions is likely to have an  
              impact in many branches of pure and applied analysis.    Costin has carried out
              this construction rigorously for functions   arising as solutions to linear or
              nonlinear differential systems   near generic singularities. Costin will use
              new techniques in the   classification of nonlinear differential systems near
              irregular   singularities, up to analytic equivalence, in providing sharp  
              information on the nature and location of singularities of nonlinear   systems,
              in the study of solvability in closed form of equations,  in solving connection
              problems and in justifying and improving   hyper-asymptotic numerical methods. 
              The technique will also be   extended to cover PDE's and difference equations. 
                Asymptotic analysis is an important method of  investigation in complex
              systems. In many important cases however,   the quantities of interest are
              influenced by parameters too small   to be controlled by classical asymptotics.
              The field of exponential  asymptotics has been introduced as a successful
              theoretical and  computational framework to deal with these situations and
              applied in  problems ranging from number theory to optics and quantum 
              mechanics. The present project is aimed at a rigorous foundation of  the field,
              at applying its techniques to the study of differential or  difference systems,
              as well as  at extending and improving the  computational methods of this new
              theory.
