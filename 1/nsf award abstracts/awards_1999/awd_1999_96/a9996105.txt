Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  OPP-9617236  WHITLEDGE, TERRY  UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AUSTIN    This
              project is designed to test the hypothesis that elevated primary production at
              the inner front continues longer than in the upper mixed layer of non-frontal
              waters in the Bering Sea, and that this production provides an energy source
              throughout the summer for a food web that supports shearwaters, salmon, and
              their zooplankton prey.  To test this hypothesis, the proposed collaborative
              research will collect and interpret observations on physical and biological
              features in the vicinity of the inner front to determine the availability of
              nutrients in the euphotic zone, the physical processes responsible for enhanced
              vertical flux of nutrients, primary production, the distribution, abundance and
              trophic ecology of near-surface swarms of euphausiids and other zooplankton,
              the distribution, abundance, and foraging ecology of shearwaters, and by stable
              isotope enrichment in trophic pathways from phytoplankton to shearwaters at and
              away from the front.  The proposed research is important because it will be the
              first examination of the physical processes of the inner front in post-bloom
              primary production, focus on the ecological role of this extended production,
              and relate the evolution of transequatorial migration patterns of seabirds to
              biophysical processes that create predictable sources of prey.
