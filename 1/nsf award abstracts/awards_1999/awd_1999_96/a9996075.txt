Abstract    :
              This project builds upon a long-term effort to create and distribute a
              comprehensive set of tools for research and development of spoken language
              systems.  The effort has so far produced a large collection of speech corpora
              that are used in research, and has produced a portable software environment for
              authoring and using spoken language systems.   The CARE project under
              consideration includes continuous envolutionary improvement of the systems and
              corpora, along with enhancements in some new directions.  Three new lines of
              work that will be pursued are the establishment of evaluation criteria for
              evaluating new technologies in interactive systems, development of a new corpus
              of speech of young speakers, and development of  training materials covering
              use of the toolkit in research and education.
