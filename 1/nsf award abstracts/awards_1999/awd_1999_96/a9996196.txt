Abstract    :
              9631151  Winicov  This award supports an international collaboration with Latvia
              (former USSR) to study genes/enzymes that are important in forest trees with
              respect to acid rain and ozone protection.     The Pis in this collaboration
              will characterize genes/transcripts/enzymes for a radical detoxifying enzyme,
              ascorbate peroxidase.  They will use PCR, gene cloning and DNA sequencing
              technologies.    The work will be conducted with pine trees (pinus strobus)
              which are of ecological and economical importance for Latvia.  The data will be
              relevant also for US forestry interests.
