Abstract    :
              Abstract    OPP-9714926  MASCHNER  UNIV. WISCONSIN    This workshop will address
              the processes for sharing, disseminating, and standardizing ecological,
              archaeological, and paleoecological data obtained from the Aleutian Archipelago
              for human behavioral studies.  The goals are to establish a common research
              agenda that would address the relationship between humans and their
              environments in the southern Bering Sea and Aleutian region; to develop an
              overarching research design to investigate some of the "big issues" in northern
              social sciences; and to ensure outlets for integration and collaboration.  The
              organization of the workshop will include short research-based presentations by
              participants, task groups that will document key issues in Aleutian research,
              and colloquia which would outline a monograph of Aleutian ecology, archaeology,
              and paleoecology to establish a knowledge baseline for future research. 
              Participation is planned to included academic researchers and local people
              knowledgeable and interested in the Aleutian environment.
