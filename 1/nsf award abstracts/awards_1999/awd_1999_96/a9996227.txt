Abstract    :
              9626140  Kalfagianni    This project lies in the general area of low-dimensional
              topology. The investigator will attempt to develop a theory of finite type
              invariants for knots and links in an arbitrary 3-manifold as a generalization
              of the Jones invariants. She will also study these invariants via geometric
              methods, and try to understand what types of knots they detect.   
              Low-dimensional topology is mainly concerned with classifying spaces of
              dimensions three and four, where two spaces are treated as equivalent if one
              space can be deformed onto the other without tearing - this is known as a
              homeomorphic transformation. Such a classification, known as the topological
              classification, has been essentially carried out in dimensions other than three
              and four. It turns out that these two dimensions provide further technical
              difficulties, some of which are topics of much current interest as they
              interface with various ideas of modern physics.
