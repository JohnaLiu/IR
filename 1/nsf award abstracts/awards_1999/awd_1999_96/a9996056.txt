Abstract    :
                This award supports the research of Professor M. Vancliff to work  in
              non-commutative ring theory with special emphasis on problems  arising from the
              theory of graded regular algebras. In  particular, Professor Vancliff will try
              to classify the quadratic  regular algebras of global dimension n with Hilbert
              series the  same as that of the polynomial ring on n variables that map onto  a
              certain twisted homogeneous coordinate ring of a quadric lying  in n-1
              dimensional projective space. She hopes that this will  lead to methods of
              constructing examples of Artin-Schelter  algebras with new behavior.    This is
              research in the subfield of algebra called  non-commutative ring theory.
              Algebra can be thought of as the  study of symmetry in the abstract. As such,
              algebra has direct  applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In fact,
              much of  non-commutative ring theory generalizes structures found in  quantum
              mechanics and this proposal continues to explore areas  that connect directly
              with modern quantum field theory.
