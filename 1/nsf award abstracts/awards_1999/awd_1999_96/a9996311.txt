Abstract    :
                        Graham  9801446    This project involves several interrelated areas in
              spectral graph theory, extremal graph theory, and quasi-random graphs.  The
              goal is to deduce the fundamental properties and structures of a graph from its
              graph spectrum or from a short list of easily computable invariants. One
              approach is to examine the relationship of various graph properties and to
              identify large equivalence classes of graph properties. Geometric methods are
              used to derive spectral bounds and to improve the rate of convergence for
              random walk problems. Part of the research is closely coupled with the study of
              very large graphs in connection with many combinatorial problems arising in
              massive data sets.      This research is in the area of combinatorics. One of
              the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods for manipulating and
              enumerating discrete collections of objects. The behavior of discrete systems
              is extremely  important to modern communications. For example, the design of
              large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of
              algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
              makes use of  combinatorial research.
