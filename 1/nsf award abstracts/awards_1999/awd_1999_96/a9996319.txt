Abstract    :
                Rankin  9800767               Previous research into how environment
              influences  resource allocation to foraging rely on the ability of the 
              researcher to correctly classify an organism's behavior.  These studies also
              rely on the assumption that rough  measures of resources provided by caloric
              output and time  allocation are accurate measures of allocation of limiting 
              nutrients. By utilizing a trap-synthesizing organism, the  PI can unambiguously
              classify the investment into foraging.  Furthermore, based upon recent advances
              in my understanding  of the nutritional ecology of the web, the PI  now knows 
              that some components of the web are limiting essential  nutrients requiring
              budgeting by the individual organism in  response to its environment. It is
              tantilizing that  preliminary results indicate that such a vital function as 
              allocation of a limiting resource might vary among the  offpring of different
              individual females from a single  population. Only by a more extensive test,
              using the  offspring of many more females, can the possibility of a  family x
              treatment interaction be proven or disproven.
