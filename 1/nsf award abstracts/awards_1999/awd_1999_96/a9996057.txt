Abstract    :
              This project seeks to understand why democracy survives in `least likely cases`
              and why it sometimes fails in `most likely cases.`  The end result of this
              project will be a more complete and scientifically grounded understanding of
              democratic consolidation and collapse.  The explanation that it offers will be
              based on an explicit test of contending theories, including a reexamination of
              classic works in the field and attention to recent scholarship, as well as the
              application of econometrics and game-theoretic models.  The empirical test of
              these theories will entail a comparative study of a number of cases selected on
              the basis of theoretical consideration and representing several geographical
              regions of the world.  Thus the project will not only add to the current work
              being done in democratization, but also help us answer the more general
              question of why democracies survive in some countries but not others.  This
              POWRE award will give the investigator the opportunity to visit California
              Institute of Technology for twelve months.  This Visiting Professorship will
              allow for significant professional growth.  She will take advantage of
              Caltech's national prominence in econometrics and game theory by spending the
              year retooling in advanced methodological skills.  In addition to retooling,
              she will conduct research and consult with Caltech faculty to scientifically
              analyze democratic consolidation.  This experience will enhance the analytic
              sophistication of her research and possibly lead to her promotion to Full
              Professor at Texas A&M University.  The completion of her research on a topic
              with broader applicability than her work to date will also increase her
              visibility as a political scientist to the discipline nationally.
