Abstract    :
              9458000  Barmak    This research examines processing and characterization of 
              nanostructured metal films and functionally gradient coatings.    New
              electrochemically-based processing techniques for the  fabrication of gradient
              coatings is a major focus.  Processing  parameters are optimized based on
              microstructural studies and the  results of mechanical and corrosion tests.  In
              nanostructured metal  films, there is a two-fold approach: one is the role of
              grain  structure and grain boundary diffusion in the reaction of thin  metal
              films; the other is an interdisciplinary investigation on  grain boundary
              segregation in nanostructured magnetic films for  thin film storage media in
              collaboration with IBM.  Several  undergraduate projects will be condensed and
              set up as laboratory  experiments for the senior undergraduate/introductory
              graduate  level course entitled; "Metal Films and Coatings: Processing, 
              Structure and Properties", which was recently introduced into the  curriculum. 
                %%%  Nanostructured metal films continue to bring about major advances  in
              the microelectronics and information storage technologies.   Functionally
              gradient materials, as thermal barrier coatings in  engine components, present
              a significant potential for future gas  turbine design for power generation.
