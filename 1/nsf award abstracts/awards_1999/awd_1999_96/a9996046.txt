Abstract    :
              Visualizing Machine Learning Models and Data  Choosing an appropriate model for
              the data or changing an existing model are both essential, but difficult steps
              in machine learning. Surprisingly, the trend in machine learning research has
              been to ignore that wonderful visual information processor--the  human--and to
              build learning systems that are stand-alone and fully automated.  This research
              is attempting to show that machine learning is a task best shared by humans and
              machine because of their unique capabilities.  Human vision gives us built-in
              features such as motion detection and direction, stereoscopic depth, edge and
              shape detection, grouping by color, light, and shade.  Because of these
              features, humans are good at quickly recognizing complex patterns in visual
              data, quickly detecting outliers in visual data, and visually manipulating a
              model to reflect the data.  In contrast, machines are good at fast, accurate,
              and repetitive calculations necessary for machine learning. Not only is an
              appropriate division of labor between human and machine important, but a
              visualization of a learned model can serve as a visual explanation of why the
              learned model fits the data.  Finally, visualization together with direct
              manipulation of the model can make it easier for the user to change the model
              to reflect the data, immediately see the results, and focus on interesting data
              regions. The impact of this research is that is may become easier to find good
              learning models and to visually understand why they are good.
