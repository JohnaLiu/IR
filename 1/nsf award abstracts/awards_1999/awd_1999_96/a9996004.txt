Abstract    :
              Model-based object recognition is a popular and difficult subfield  of computer
              vision research. The problem of model-based recognition  of free-form objects
              is addressed in this project. This problem has  many practical ramifications
              and robust solutions will be  applicable in areas including modern
              manufacturing and autonomous  navigation. Prior work in model-based recognition
              will be used to  develop representations for 3D objects which are suitable for
              use  in recognition, prototype recognition strategies with an explicit  goal of
              efficiency, and disseminate their research results in the  standard forms,
              including electronic archives available over the  Internet. The project has the
              following major components: (1)  Development of an object representation
              strategy for free-form  objects suitable for both image synthesis and object
              recognition.  Point-based representations are considered along with surface 
              triangulations. (2) Development of a recognition and localization  technique
              based on the representation strategy chosen. An  industrial collaboration will
              allow the PI to obtain  variable-resolution triangulation-based models of
              free-form objects  from real range data obtained from real sensors. A small
              tabletop  three-axis mill will be used to fabricate prototypes of free-form 
              objects from CAD designs.
