Abstract    :
              Arthur Lewbel  Brandeis University  SBR-9514977    The research will attempt to
              solve many of the problems  associated with estimating consumer demand. 
              Included in the  research will be an attempt to separate out the effect of 
              changing prices when most prices move in parallel, a refinement  for combining
              information from national consumption trends with  information for some years
              on individuals' consumption, better  methods for estimating expenditures on
              individual goods,  particularly when some goods are bought infrequently (i.e. 
              automobiles), and modeling of intrahousehold consumption  decisions and
              behaviors.  Sophisticated econometric techniques  will be used in this
              research.
