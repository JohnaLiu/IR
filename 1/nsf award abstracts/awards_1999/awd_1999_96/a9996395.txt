Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    The Department of mechanical Engineering at Kansas State University
              (KSU) will acquire and upgrade equipment for development of Holographic
              Particle Image Velocimetry (HPIV). A Laser Flow Diagnostics Laboratory, with
              its primary goal being the development and application of HPIV, has been set up
              in the Department. The upgrade will enable off-axis HPIV and the establishment
              of a suitable data processing system. The upgrade consists of adding injection
              seeding and an improved transverse-mode option to the existing pulsed laser to
              convert it to a highly coherent laser that can record holograms of
              three-dimensional particle fields, matching the wavelength of the hologram
              reconstruction laser to that of the recording laser, and setting up an
              open-architecture heterogeneous optical-digital data processing system. The
              establishment of HPIV will bring the capability of providing instantaneous
              high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) flou velocity field data. Its
              establishment will contribute to our understanding, modeling and controlling of
              turbulent and complex  flows which are of fundamental and technological
              importance.
