Abstract    :
              This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award in the Inorganic,  
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by   Dr.
              Patrick J. Walsh, Chemistry Department, San Diego State University,   on the
              mechanism of asymmetric induction by titanium catalysts.  Several   new chiral
              titanium bis(sulfonamido) complexes will be prepared and   tested for their
              effectiveness in the catalytic asymmetric addition of   alkyl groups to
              aldehydes.  They are expected to model the intermediates   in this reaction and
              so to provide guidance about important features of   the active site and about
              design of more effective catalysts.  In   addition to involving undergraduate
              students in this research, Dr. Walsh   will conduct an extensive outreach
              program to enrich chemistry education   in the San Diego-northern Mexico
              region.  Selective synthesis of compounds with a specific symmetry, that is, of
                either a right- or left-handed form, is an important chemical goal.   
              Methods of this type are critical to the pharmaceutical industry and to   many
              biological studies.  In this research, a more detailed knowledge of   the way
              in which selective synthesis occurs will be achieved.    Undergraduates will be
              involved in this problem-directed research.  In   addition, outreach programs
              in science in collaboration with the   Instituto Tecnologico de Tijuana for US
              and Mexican students will be   undertaken.
