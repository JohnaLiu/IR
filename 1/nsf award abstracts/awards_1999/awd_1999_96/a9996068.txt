Abstract    :
              CMS 9616429  Olson    The twin earthquakes of September 19 and 20, 1985 that 
              devastated central zones of Mexico City remain one of the  great urban
              catastrophes of the late 20th century.  One of  the most significant
              characteristics of the disaster was the  breath, depth and duration of popular
              response, especially  the emergent organizations that focused on a variety of
              post-  earthquake problems.  This project analyzes the life cycle  of two sets
              of such organizations.  These include groups and  organizations that
              transformed in the years after the  earthquake and survive to this day, and
              those that also  emerged out of the earthquake and were active during the 
              emergency phase but disappeared at various points during  recovery and
              reconstruction.  Aside from being an  interesting phenomenon for researchers to
              study, such groups  represent an important resource during the time of
              disaster.  Thus a practical  implication of  developing an improved 
              understanding of the origin, nature and changes such  organizations undergo is
              that it will give emergency  management  practitioners in the U.S. and
              elsewhere insight  on how to more effectively incorporate them into their 
              disaster planning and subsequent emergency activities.  The  multiple data
              sources for this study will include  interviews, archival materials, and direct
              observation.
