Abstract    :
              MCB 9507206  Angela Wandinger-Ness     This project examines the mechanisms of
              membrane transport in the endocytic pathway and the function of the late
              endosome in both transport and in catalyzing  specialized reactions.  To this
              end, a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches will be used to
              characterize the interaction of specific forms of rab7 with the actin
              cytoskeleton.  The yeast two hybrid system will be employed to identify
              interacting partners of rab7 as a corollary approach.  In addition, an in vitro
              assay system will be developed to study late endocytic membrane transport. 
              This latter analysis will be extended by the development of a permeabilized
              system which examines the mechanisms of interaction between rab7 and its
              partners.  This project is a Faculty Early Career Development Award and also
              entail an education plan.  In the Education portion of this project an approach
              is developed for active learning in the undergraduate classroom.  In addition,
              introduction to career-training programs will be provided to the students to
              make them better suited to the job market.  Finally, the project includes
              outreach to pre-college educators.  %%%  This project will examine the
              mechanisms by which components are directed to specific locations within the
              cell.  It will help explain how molecules such as food enter the cell and end
              up in the correct location for digestion.  The education plan of this project
              will serve to strengthen the undergraduate education at the awardee's
              institution, and to make the undergraduates at the institution better suited to
              the job market.  ***
