Abstract    :
              9752985       This project will result in a set of high-quality, interactive 
              learning tools for organic chemistry.  It has three main  components: the
              designing and writing interactive materials for the  EMOC website, developing
              tools for facilitating alternative methods  of assessment, and evaluating
              existing and future materials as they  become available on the EMOC website. 
              The materials are being  developed using hypertext markup language (HTML) with
              interactivity  provided by common gateway interface (CGI) scripts written in
              the  Perl scripting language.  Database interface tools will be  developed for
              the Oracle Database Server using the OraPerl add-on's  to Perl.  This
              combination of technologies provides flexibility  while serving the intended
              audience through commonly available  software interfaces.       Evaluation will
              be highly interactive and consist of free-  response student surveys as well as
              individual interviews and focus  group meetings.  Student attitude towards both
              the interactive  technologies and the learning impact of the materials will be 
              surveyed.  The development of interactive database tools removes  the
              'bookkeeping' related with authentic, process-oriented  assessment of large
              introductory undergraduate courses.       This project advanced the development
              of learning environments  for undergraduate organic chemistry courses involving
              large numbers  of students.
