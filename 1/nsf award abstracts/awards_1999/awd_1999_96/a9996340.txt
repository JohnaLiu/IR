Abstract    :
              This project addresses three problems whose solutions are needed for the 
              advancement of instruction-level parallelism.  They are:  a decentralized 
              execution architecture to increase scalability; an instruction fetch mechanism 
              that can accommodate control flow changes; and a dependency checking mechanism.
                Research will concentrate on the parallel execution window (PEW) model of 
              execution, in which the window of instructions are generally allocated to the 
              same execution window, so that parallel actions will usually be independent.  
              This project will involve undergraduate and graduate students in the
              development  of simuators and in their use in quantitative architectural
              comparisons.
