Abstract    :
                   This proposal solicits funding to support a multi-state effort  to develop
              curricula and laboratory materials for student learning  in advanced skills
              technologies for fifteen occupational areas  supporting the American machining
              and machine tool industries.  The  Machine Tool Advanced Skills Technology
              Educational Resources  (MASTER) Program will design, develop, test and
              disseminate new  curricula materials for AS/AAS degree options in machining and
               metals related technologies.  Since these occupational areas  generally
              require some form of apprenticeship or internship, these  educational materials
              will also be designed and prescribed for use  with industry partners.  The
              problems addressed by this project  are:  (1) the use of outdated curricula
              materials by schools and  colleges; (2) fewer students entering programs of
              study in these  career fields that are highly important to the nation's economy
              in  aerospace, metals, and manufacturing; (3) the rapid evolution of  new
              multi-task machine tools that have reached beyond the  capabilities of many
              existing technicians; and (4) the lack of  rigorous college level programs that
              are needed to prepare a target  audience of knowledge based workers in advanced
              problem solving  skills.  Four key goals will be addressed by the MASTER
              Program:   (1) to provide more technical graduates that are multi-skilled in 
              new machining tools and support related technologies; (2) to  upgrade curricula
              and laboratories in these technical fields which  are critical to the success
              of our nation; (3) to offer  college-level training to existing industry
              employees to become  multi-skilled with new and highly advanced equipment; (4)
              to  establish realistic opportunities for college and industrial  partners to
              validate competency requirements, prepare a national  model for
              apprenticeship/internship with prescribed laboratory work  experiences; and (5)
              to disseminate the new curricula and  educational materials nationally.  This
              collaborative effort brings  together  six of the nation's leading two-year
              colleges,  geographically dispersed, in areas of high demand, with identified 
              public school and industry partners.  Significant national outcomes  can be the
              survival of many critical industries and technical jobs.
