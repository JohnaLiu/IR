Abstract    :
              Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves offer many important  computational advantages
              over the "ordinary" Bezier/B-spline  representations commonly used in CAD/CAM
              applications. Among the  attributes that distinguish PH curves from the latter
              are: exact  rectification in terms of a polynomial arc-length function; exact 
              rational representations of their offsets; a closed-form  expression, suitable
              for purposes of optimization, for their  elastic bending energies; and a
              propensity to yield fairer loci  --- exhibiting a smoother curver distribution
              --- in the  interpolation of discrete data. Moreover, existing CAD systems  can
              readily take advantage of these properties, since the PH  curves are entirely
              compatible with the Bezier/B-spline  representation.    This project
              investigates outstanding theoretical and algorithmic  issues concerning the
              construction and manipulation of PH curves.  Their solution will permit the
              full potential of PH curves to be  realized in applications such as rapid
              prototyping and NC  milling. These issues encompass trimming procedures for PH
              curve  offsets; real-time CNC interpolators for PH curves; optimal shape 
              design with PH curves; algorithms for efficient construction of  C2 PH splines;
              and alternate algebraic formulations for PH space  curves.  ***
