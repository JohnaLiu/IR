This is an award to support research on the thermal and
              photochemical induced reactions of iron in several oxidation states and
              chemical forms.  The photochemical processes of dissolved iron subject to being
              complexed by natural ligands will be studied with respect to reactivity and
              reaction products.  Thermal and photochemical reactions of iron in colloidal
              form and in nanoclusters will be investigated for its potential role in
              enhancement of reactivity attributable to the relatively large  surface area of
              iron in those forms.  

The proposal leading to this award was submitted in
              response to the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program that
              emphasizes combining discovery of new knowledge with inspired teaching and
              enthusiastic learning.  The research component is expected to lead to more
              efficient and versatile treatment processes as well as better understanding
              than now exists of the dynamic behavior of microbial nutrients.  The
              educational component of this project will relate the underlying science
              associated with corrosion of iron to experiences students have had personally
              and indirectly as exemplified by observations of  transformations of the iron
              hull of the Titanic during its 80 years of exposure to sea water.
