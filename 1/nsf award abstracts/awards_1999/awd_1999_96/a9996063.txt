              ATM 95-28201  ABSTRACT  ALAN ROBOCK  UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND  TITLE:  "CLIMATE
              EFFECTS OF VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS"    This is a three year grant to investigate the
              global climate effects of volcanic eruptions with the help of the best data
              that are available and state of the art modeling.  Some of the tasks to be
              accomplished are         1)  Building the data base using direct observations
              of recent eruptions and indirect observations like ice core records of the past
              eruptions, 2)  simulation of climate effects with state of the art models.   
              Volcanic effects are important forcings of global climate change.  This project
              strives to give quantitative estimate of the volcanic eruptions effect.
