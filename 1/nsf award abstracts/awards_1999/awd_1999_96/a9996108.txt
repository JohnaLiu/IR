              ability is dependent on the pattern of connections  among nerve cells and the
              ability to transmit information  between cells. Learning involves the
              adjustment of this  transmission as a result of experience. There are a variety
               of mechanisms that could potentially alter the communication  between cells in
              the brain. This project examines one of  those mechanism, the ability of cells
              to adjust their  release of the chemical substances important in transmitting 
              information from one cell to another, in an important part  of the brain called
              the hippocampus. Behavioral experiments  dissociate the different aspects of
              experience that are  critical for the modification of transmission between
              cells  in the brain, while physiological experiments at the  cellular level
              test hypotheses about the mechanism by which  the communication between these
              cells is altered to reflect  this experience. Examination of the role of
              different  aspects of experience in driving the changes in cell  function
              provides important information about learning.  Combining this with studies of
              the cellular processes  underlying these changes provides important information
               necessary to understand fundamental mechanisms by which the  brain learns and
              adapts to novel environments, as well as  processes important in development,
              aging, and recovery from  injury.
