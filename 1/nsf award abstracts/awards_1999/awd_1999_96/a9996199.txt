                9726511   BOHS    Molecular Phylogenetic Studies in the genus Solanum
              (Solanaceae) Lynn A. Bohs    The tomato family (Solanaceae) is one of world's
              most economically important plant groups, and many of these species have been
              introduced throughout the world from the Americas.  Familiar members of the
              family include the tomato, potato, and eggplant, as well as other minor food
              crops and tobacco.   Certain species are sources of foods, ornamental plants,
              and medicinally valuable or poisonous alkaloids.  Solanum, one of the largest
              genera of any plant family, has about 1500 species throughout the world, but
              species are most numerous in the New World tropics.  Solanum exhibits a
              remarkable diversity in morphology, biochemistry, reproductive systems, and
              dispersal patterns that make it ideal group for evolutionary studies.  Because
              the understanding of the classification and evolution of Solanum is very
              limited, the ability of agriculturists and scientists to utilize species of
              economic and scientific interest is hindered.  Dr. Bohs will use two molecular
              data sets, one from the chloroplast genome and one from the nuclear ribosomal
              DNA, to examine evolutionary relationships across the taxonomic spectrum of the
              entire genus.  This study will arrive at a classification framework that can be
              used to guide more detailed studies at lower taxonomic levels. Questions
              concerning biogeographic patterns, breeding system evolution, and fruit
              morphology and dispersal will be examined in a phylogenetic context.  A field
              trip to Bolivia is planned to collect unusual and poorly known representatives
              of Solanum that will enhance our knowledge of morphological evolution and
              species diversity in this large and important genus.
