Abstract    :
              9706143  Heaney  This project will investigate the isotopic structure of
              carbonado, a variety of polycrystalline diamond. It is hypothesized that
              carbonado did not form in the upper mantle, but crystallized from preexisting
              organic carbon. The PI's will examine carbonado samples from Brazil and the
              Central African Republic. They will address the following questions: (1) what
              is the source of the carbon? (2) What is the microstructural evidence for
              meteoritic shock? (3) Did the REE-phosphates form by fissiogenic processes? (4)
              Did these carbonados crystallize as part of a single event or process? A
              variety of microanalytical techniques will be used. Electron microprobe and TEM
              will be used to investigate shock textures.  SIMS  will be used to determine C
              isotopes and REE ratios.
