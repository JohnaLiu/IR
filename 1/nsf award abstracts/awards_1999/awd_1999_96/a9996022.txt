Abstract    :
              9629716  Wade    Speciation, the splitting of one species into two, is a basic
              process in biology.  It occurs when two populations become genetically
              different enough that they cannot produce fertile offspring.  This project
              studies the genetic basis for this reproductive isolation in two species of
              flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum and T. freemani, which produce sterile
              offspring when crossed.  In crosses among different strains of these species,
              there is variation in the proportion of offspring that are female and the
              frequency of deformed males.  Genetic crosses and selection experiments will be
              used to investigate the genetic basis for these differences.    These
              experiments address how selective forces and genetic variation within a species
              result in enough divergence for reproductive isolation and speciation. 
              Studying the genetic basis for speciation is fundamental for understanding the
              generation of species biodiversity.
