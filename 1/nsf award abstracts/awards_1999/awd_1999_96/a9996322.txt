Abstract    :
              Within the next several years, worldwide information systems will deal with the
              collection interpretation of several gigabytes of data generated daily at
              thousands of individual sites.  Locating data in such a heterogeneous
              distributed-database system, is tantamount to funding the proverbial needle in
              a worldwide haystack.  To accomplish this endeavor, an appropriate data model
              based on an understanding of the type and magnitude of the data collected and
              on the type and relative frequency of the queries to be performed on the data
              are being developed.  Algorithms for conducting parallel searches, indexing,
              and compression of the multi-faceted data are required.  Also necessary are the
              protocols for communicating among the many nodes that constitute the entire
              search space.  These protocols must allow for efficient, reliable, and secure
              distribution of queries and results among a variety of platforms. 
              Multicomputer search engines at each data storage site are developed.  A set of
              collaborators employs the prototype for evaluation and their feedback will be
              incorporated into the final implementation.  The results obtained in this
              research may serve as a guideline for the development of worldwide both rigidly
              and loosely structured databases.
