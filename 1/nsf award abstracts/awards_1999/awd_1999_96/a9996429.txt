Abstract    :
              Three research issues in high-performance VLSI system design are  being
              addressed:  (1) how to relate the system performance  function, characterized
              by electrical parameters, to the  geometrical parameters of the VLSI physical
              design; (2) how to  model performance driven VLSI physical designs based on
              given  technology and computational capability; and (3) how to  characterize
              the fundamental computational aspects of modeled  problems and develop
              effective algorithms for solving them.           A distributed RLC circuit
              model for interconnects is being  designed.  It considers: non-monotone circuit
              response, coupling  effect among the signal lines, and low energy consumption. 
               Efficient computation methods that solve time-varying Maxwell  equations using
              the adaptive wavelet collocation method (AWCM) are  being devised.  The
              algorithms and methods are being included in a  CAD system.
