Abstract    :
              The investigator monitors thermospheric atomic oxygen concentration in the
              thermosphere using ground-based incoherent scatter radar data.  As the primary
              neutral species, atomic oxygen is a fundamental parameter for understanding
              thermospheric and ionospheric processes.  However, no in situ measurements of
              absolute density have been made for 15 years, and current state-of-the-art
              understanding of this parameters stems from empirical models incorporating
              oxygen densities measured by satellites prior to 1982.  It is quite possible
              that empirical models based on this old satellite data do not properly predict
              the current state of the thermosphere.  This database provides the necessary
              check on the models, and information on whether their predictions are accurate
              into solar cycles beyond where the data is contained.  The ongoing monitoring
              of thermospheric density has many applications to space weather prediction.
