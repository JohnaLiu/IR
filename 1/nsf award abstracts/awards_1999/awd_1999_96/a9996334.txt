Abstract    :
              9457960  Pugh  Research is proposed for the synthesis of novel materials using  
              i) organized solutions to thread macrocycles with polymer to form 
              polyrotaxanes, ii) chain extension reactions to form polyrotaxane  networks,
              and iii) intramolecular Claisen rearrangements to form  ladder polymers.  This
              will result in both new topologies and new  routes to important molecular
              architectures.  %%%  ***
