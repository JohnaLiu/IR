Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Wedgewood  University of Washington  CTS-9510398      This work
              explores a novel formulation for constitutive relations for viscoelastic
              fluids.  I is well-known that such equations much be frame indifferent and this
              stipulation has resulted in the elimination of the vorticity among the
              dependent variables, since vorticity is not frame indifferent.  In this work,
              the decomposition of the vorticity into two parts is considered.  The
              deformational vorticity is frame invariant and can be used in constitutive
              formulations whereas the rigid vorticity is not frame invariant.  These new
              kinematic variables permit the introduction of long range interactions to be
              modeled. The specific work under the SGER will consist of microscale modeling
              of constitutive behavior and the interpretation of the results through the new
              model.  Also, experiments will be undertaken to highlight effects which would
              be predicted by this mode.
