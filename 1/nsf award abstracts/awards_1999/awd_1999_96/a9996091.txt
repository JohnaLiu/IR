Abstract    :
              9554610  Dow           Central to Buffalo's Local Systemic Change Through
              Teacher  Education project TEAM 2000 (Teacher Education at the Museum) is a 
              plan to implement a constructivist teaching and learning science  program in
              all of Buffalo's sixty-one elementary schools by the  year 2000.  The project
              is an outgrowth of a long-standing  partnership between the Buffalo Public
              Schools and the Buffalo  Museum of Science.  A previous NSF funded project of
              this  collaboration resulted in the development of 150 teacher leaders of 
              hands-on science.  These teachers, the TEAM staff, and scientists  from the
              informal sector will form the core of the instructional  staff for the current
              project.  Together they will provide  professional development for all 1400 K-8
              teachers in the city's 61  elementary schools.  The program will also provide
              opportunities  for TEAM mentors to pursue their own continuing professional 
              development, a process that is essential for the long term  implementation and
              well-being of Buffalo's Elementary and Middle  Level Science Program.  In
              addition, TEAM 2000 will create a  Science Materials Center that will provide
              for the continuous  design, delivery, and reconditioning of instructional kits
              and  materials to facilitate the on-going growth and development of the 
              District's science program.    The cost sharing for the project will be 46% of
              the NSF award.
