Abstract    :
              9753064  Souvaine, Diane L.  Rutgers University    POWRE: Geometric Computation
              and Applications    Computational geometry deals with algorithmic aspects of
              geometric   problems. The problems studied have often been abstracted from real
              life   applications, but these abstractions are frequently so far removed from
              the   original problem that the solutions cannot possibly impact real-life
              calculations.  Furthermore, the original problems may be so complicated that
              the state-of-the-art techniques in theoretical computational geometry are
              insufficient to provide major breakthroughs in the application area.   Finally,
              collaborations between theoretical computational geometers and   researchers
              with geometric applications are impeded by differences in training and in
              vocabulary.  While devoting again full energies to research after several years
              of academic administration, the PI proposes exploratory work in how to conduct
              research in theoretical computational geometry, to be valued by that community,
              while maintaining real collaborations with applied scientists and demonstrably
              impacting the applied field as well. The particular application areas selected
              are wireless communications and cartography.
