Abstract    :
              Much of the research on workflow management has assumed a centrally-controlled
              work environment where common definitions for tasks and information are known
              and respected by all workgroups using the system. Autonomous groups, however,
              may be free to redefine or eliminate individual activities or sequences, making
              predefined coordination with others highly problematic. While the general
              problem of unconstrained workflow coordination is difficult, some classes of
              inter-operating workflows are constrained enough to be manageable and
              studyable---for example, repetitive, operations-level workflows that constitute
              the much of the work performed in many organizations. This project aims to
              produce a conceptual and formal model of coordinating interoperating workflow
              management systems (WFMSs) that allows compensations for task redefinitions to
              be fully or partially automated. The model will be partially validated by
              constructing an executable version of the model, and exercising the model with
              a set of test cases. An approach of progressive model refinement will be used
              to gain the ability to "grow" the model, using the executable model as a
              simulator and incorporating simulation findings back into the model. The
              transparent, well-articulated architecture of the model will improve
              understanding of dynamic task coordination and will enable improved
              functionality of interoperating WFMS in dynamic environments.
