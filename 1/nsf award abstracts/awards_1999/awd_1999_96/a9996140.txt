Abstract    :
              This research focuses on developing an integrated multimedia information
              retrieval and database management infrastructure that provides support for
              multimedia information as first-class objects capable of being stored and
              retrieved based on their rich internal content. Specifically, techniques are
              being explored to (1) extract and represent multimedia content at multiple
              semantic levels useful for retrieval; (2) generalize text-based information
              retrieval approaches for content-based multimedia retrieval; (3) map high-level
              queries to lower-level representations supported by the database; (4) perform
              feature indexing that overcomes the high-dimensionality and non-euclidean
              nature of multimedia feature spaces; (5) integrate feature indexing mechanisms
              as access paths in database management systems; and (6) support ranked
              retrieval in database management systems. Based on the research, a prototype
              system, entitled Multimedia Analysis and Retrieval System (MARS), that
              seamlessly integrates multimedia data with structured information traditionally
              stored in databases is being designed. On the educational front, the existing
              database curriculum is being modified to incorporate evolving research and
              development in multimedia information systems. Also, the MARS prototype system
              is being made available as a teaching, education, and research tool to study
              human factors issues in supporting content-based retrieval. This research not
              only has the potential to impact the design of future multimedia information
              systems but will also prove beneficial to other areas including geographical
              information retrieval, planning and reasoning applications over database
              systems.    http://www-mars.cs.uiuc.edu
