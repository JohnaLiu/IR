Abstract    :
              A method is proposed for the decoupling of design and manufacturing of micro- 
              electromechanical systems (MEMS) and devices.  A design infrastructure is to be
               developed that will allow non-experts to quickly design and simulate MEMS
              devices  and systems.  The philosophy follows the VLSI paradigm, where there is
              a clear  separation between the wafer fabrication and the design effort that
              creates the  pattern which is to be implemented.    MEMS software tools, device
              models, and educational materials will be made  available on the Internet. 
              These tools will include schematic editing, layout  synthesis, parameter
              extraction and simulation.    The proposal also contains a strong education
              plan extending the PI's successes  in recruiting undergraduates, including
              women and under-represented minorities,  to become research students.
