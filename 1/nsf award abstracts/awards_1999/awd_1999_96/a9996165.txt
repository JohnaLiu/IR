Abstract    :
                   This project involves the development and improvement  of a new
              conformational search strategy based on a convex  global underestimator (CGU). 
              The CGU search strategy has  already been successfully tested on the Sun model
              for  protein folding.  This project will (1) speed up the CGU  method for fast
              conformational searches and (2) improve the  potential energy function by
              parameter estimation.  Several  enhancements will be used to speed up the
              method, including  (a) using a core-directed chain growth method as a front 
              end, (b) using the Han and Baker secondary structure rules,  where applicable,
              to reduce the number of degrees of  freedom, and (c) using Appel's method to
              reduce the number  of required energy evaluations.       To improve the search
              method so that it will work with  better energy functions, this project will
              systematically  move away from the Sun model toward more realistic protein 
              potential functions and models.  To do this, a new  computational parameter
              estimation method that can  simultaneously adjust all the energy function
              parameters  will be developed, so as to reduce the difference between  the
              global minimum conformation in the model and known  native conformation for all
              members of a selected set of  proteins.
