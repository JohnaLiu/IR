This award supports collaborative research between Prof.
              Daryl Moorhead, Department of Biological Sciences, Texas Tech University, and
              New Zealand collaborators Drs. Ian Hawkes and Clive Howard-Williams of the
              National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research.  Support is also provided
              to involve a U.S. graduate student in the on-site research in New Zealand.  The
              goals are to refine conceptual models; to expand the scope of existing
              simulation models of Antarctic ecosystems by incorporating data collected by NZ
              scientists in experiments that focus on fine-scale measurements of structural
              and environmental attributes of microbial mats in dry valley lakes and streams;
              and to define areas of future research.
