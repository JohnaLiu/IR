Abstract    :
              Sperry  9723464    The goal of the project is to obtain a better understanding
              of  the mechanisms of drought tolerance in plants. The hypothesis is  that the
              ability of a plant to maintain open stomata and survive  under drought
              conditions will correspond to its ability to  extract and transport soil water
              to the foliage. The plant's  potential for water extraction is determined by
              three variables:  1) its susceptibility to xylem cavitation which eliminates
              plant  water transport, 2) its rooting density and distribution, 3) the  soil
              type. Experimental and theoretical analysis of these  variables will determine
              the range of drought stress over which  water transport is possible. The
              "hydraulic potential" of the  plant will be compared with its actual water use
              to evaluate the  hypothesis. The research will be conducted on native shrubs of
               the Great Basin valleys in west-central Utah. These plants  experience a
              relatively wet spring followed by a predictable and  usually extreme summer
              drought. The nine study species represent  a spectrum of drought tolerance,
              differing widely in their  seasonal pattern of stomata! opening, vegetative
              phonology, and  rooting distribution.
