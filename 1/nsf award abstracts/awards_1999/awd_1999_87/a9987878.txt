Abstract    :
              The 7th International Symposium on Particles, Strings, and Cosmology (PASCOS 99)
              will be held in Granlibakken, Tahoe City, California, December 10-16, 1999. 
              This symposium will bring together experimentalists and theorists in elementary
              particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology to engage in the lively exchange
              of ideas which is so important to progress in the field.  The opportunity for
              researchers in astrophysics and cosmology to learn from scientists in particle
              physics, and vice versa, will be particularly valuable.
