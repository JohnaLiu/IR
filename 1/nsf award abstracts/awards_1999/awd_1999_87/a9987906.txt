Abstract    :
              The Department of Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
              provides a ten-week summer program to introduce undergraduate students to
              experimental, theoretical, and computational projects in cutting edge
              contemporary physics research.  The primary goals of the Illinois program are
              to provide students with a meaningful experience in a first-class research
              environment, to enable them to work closely and directly with practicing
              researchers, and to develop their own "research literacy" skills.  In addition
              to the primary focus on hands-on research, students participate in a variety of
              programmatic activities to foster a sense of community, promote student-faculty
              interactions, stimulate self-development, and experience a broad range of
              physics subdisciplines, from condensed matter experiment to astrophysics
              theory.
