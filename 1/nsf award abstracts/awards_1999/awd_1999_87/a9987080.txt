Abstract    :
              This project has formed the Technology Leaders Scholarship Program at Youngstown
              State University. The program is making available $2,500 per year over a
              two-year period for up to 40 undergraduate and graduate students. The relative
              number of scholarships to be distributed at each degree level is approximately
              25% A.S., 60% B.S., and 15% M.S, although flexibility is built into the program
              with a minimum recruitment goal in each area. The scholarships is disbursed to
              students majoring in computer science, mathematics, and engineering, with the
              ratio of disbursement reflecting the relative population of students currently
              in those disciplines. Entering students are required to have a minimum ACT
              score of 23 or be in the top 20% of their academic class. Continuing students
              are required to maintain at least a 3.2/4.0 GPA. Recruitment efforts are
              focused on the local service area of YSU, with particular emphasis placed on
              recruitment of minority populations and women. Retention of students through
              completion of their degree is achieved through careful selection of candidates,
              student/student and student/faculty mentoring, tracking, career guidance, and
              selecting programming aimed at keeping each student focused and maintaining
              their interest.
