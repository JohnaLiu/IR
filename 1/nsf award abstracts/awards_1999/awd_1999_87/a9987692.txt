Game theory plays a significant role in much of the
              contemporary research in economic theory and is accordingly a frequent theme in
              organized activities at outstanding research centers throughout the world. 
              This grant supports the annual summer programs in 2000-2002 of the Center for
              Game Theory in Economics, at the State University of New York at Stony Brook
              (USB).  The USB's summer program is unique in its explicit focus on game
              theory, both theoretical and applied.  Each summer research-oriented
              conferences and workshops and an intensive course of instruction on a topic of
              major significance, complemented by a further period of informal research
              activities are made available.  A large international group of researchers ---
              a mix of established scholars, junior faculty, and graduate students --- whose
              interests represent a diverse array of theoretical and applied aspects of game
              theory are brought together.  The programs for 2000-2002 are a continuation of
              the series of summer activities held at Stony Brook from 1990 to 1999, each of
              which attracted more than 150 participants.   Formal activities normally
              include a five-day conference with plenary and parallel sessions, and invited
              and contributed papers; two weeks of workshops on selected themes; and quite
              often one to two weeks of intensive instruction on selected topics. The value
              of this format and approach is evidenced by the success of the previous
              programs.
While the summer program's primary objective is to stimulate and
              disseminate new advances in both theory and applications, it also serves to
              make conceptual and methodological developments in game theory available to an
              expanding group of scholars in economics and other disciplines. At the same
              time the summer program provides a venue for these scholars to present their
              ideas and concerns to game-theorists, enabling both to explore fruitful new
              areas of collaboration. This interaction is an integral, and very valued, part
              of the activities.
