This award supports collaboration between a team of US
              mathematicians from Northwestern University,  the University of Chicago, the
              University of California at Berkeley, and a group of Chinese mathematicians
              from Fudan University in Shanghai, Shantou University in Guangdong, and the
              Institute of Mathematics in Beijing. The research is on nonlinear partial
              differential equations in fluid motion and related nonlinear problems. The
              underlying mathematical theme is that of nonlinear partial differential
              equations; the unifying physical theme is that of fluid motion.

   This
              collaboration has the potential to make significant contributions in the area
              of 
   fundamental understanding of fluid dynamics. The problems of fluid
              motion being studied arise 
in many areas including gas dynamics, elasticity,
              multiphase flow, biophysics, environment and global           change.
