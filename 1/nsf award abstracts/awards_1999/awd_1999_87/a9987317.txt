Understanding chaotic phenomena and controlling chaos to our
              advantage requires a combined effort of researchers from the fields of
              mathematics, physics, engineering and biomedical science. New tools for guiding
              or ordering chaos will be extremely useful for many important application
              problems arising from the power industry, chemical reactions, electrical and
              electronic engineering, biological systems (for example, controlling chaos in
              the human brain and heart, and perceptual processes).  Our experience in
              control theory and applications will be valuable for realising the objectives
              of this project on chaos synchronization and nonlinear observer design.  Both
              sides will work closely on many topics of common concern and develop systematic
              methods of chaos prediction and synchronization.  We will validate our results
              via practical applications to secure communication problems.  The Australian
              counterpart is Iven Mareels, Professor and Head of the Department of Electrical
              and Electronic Engineering, Melbourne University.
