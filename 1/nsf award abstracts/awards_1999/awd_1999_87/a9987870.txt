Abstract    :
              This project focuses on an experimental investigation of the pairwise correlated
              motion of electrons in atoms through measurement of electron-pair momentum
              densities.  The experiment is based on electron-impact double ionization, in
              which a projectile electron is used to knock two electrons out of the target
              atom simultaneously;  all three electrons are then detected in a triple
              coincidence measurement.  Within the limits of three-body mechanics, the
              results can be used to determine the relative motion of the two target
              electrons.  The experiments will concentrate on using the magnesium atom as a
              target, and a new apparatus will allow for an increase in the coincidence data
              rate that will make it possible to reach the precision necessary to obtain
              meaningful electron-pair-momentum densities for comparison with theoretical
              results.
