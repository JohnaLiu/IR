Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the theoretical and computational treatment of
              dissociative attachment and dissociative recombination in molecules.  The
              research combines the quantal treatment of the electron dynamics via the
              Complex Kohn Method, with time-dependent wave-packet propagation for the heavy
              particle degrees of freedom.
