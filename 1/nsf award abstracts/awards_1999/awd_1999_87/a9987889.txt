Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Drs. Lowell Kispert,
              John B. Vincent and other members of the Chemistry Department at the University
              of Alabama Tuscaloosa in re-establishing a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002 39 
              undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each conducting projects which are
              often interdisciplinary in nature under the direct supervision of Chemistry
              faculty with extensive experience in directing undergraduate research. 
              Participants will be involved in research projects in environmental chemistry,
              chemistry of materials or biological chemistry. Technical training gained by
              project participants will foster responsibility, independence, maturity and
              confidence and create researchers who are able to search out new avenues of
              investigation, are competent communicators and independent thinkers.

A
              weekly student/faculty panel will be held to investigate ethical issues that
              are pertinent to researchers in chemistry. The Ethics and Values Studies
              program will support development of an ethics and values curriculum using case
              studies to identify and analyze ethical dilemmas and foster ethical behavior.
