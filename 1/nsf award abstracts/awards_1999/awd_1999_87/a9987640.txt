This award establishes a Summer School in Condensed Matter
              and Materials Physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  The school is
              for advanced graduate students and postdoctoral associates in condensed matter
              physics, materials science and related fields.  There is presently no
              comparable school in the United States.  The objective of the school is, within
              the context of a well defined subject, to expose students to a range of
              concepts, techniques, and applications which is much broader than any one
              graduate department can provide. The vitality of this branch of science was
              recently emphasized in the decadal study by the National Research Council
              entitled Condensed-Matter and Materials Physics: Basic Research for Tomorrow's
              Technology (National Academy Press, 1999).  Each year the school will focus on
              a different area of current interest chosen for its scientific importance and
              interdisciplinary character by an advisory board of leading scientists.  This
              will help prepare the students to work independently at the forefront of
              science.  In particular, many of the most important and exciting scientific and
              technological advances have come from bringing concepts and techniques from one
              area to bear on issues arising in another.  The summer school will put students
              in a better position to make these connections.  The school will run for
              approximately four weeks and would be comprised of about fifty students,
              fifteen lecturers and two-three scientifc organizers.
