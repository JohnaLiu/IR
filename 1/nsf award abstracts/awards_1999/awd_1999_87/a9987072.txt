Abstract    :
              In recent years, NSF has recognized the key role that community colleges now
              play in the nation's system of higher education. The college involved in this
              project is an established leader in associate degree level science education
              and has been offering quality programs in Computer Science, Engineering and
              Mathematics. Annual surveys of CSEM graduates from 1994-97 with very high
              response rates indicate that over 95% were employed, enrolled in 4-year IHEs,
              or both.

The goal of the project is to increase the number of academically
              talented but financially disadvantaged persons, particularly Blacks, Latinos
              and women, enrolling full-time in CSEM Associate degree programs and completing
              their degrees as preparation for CSEM careers and further higher education. The
              project uses a combination of expanded scholarship opportunities, a special
              recruitment effort, and a support network delivering assistive services to 1)
              cut the three-year success rate gap between minorities and majority CSEM
              students in stages by two-thirds and 2) increase the three-year graduation rate
              for women CSEM majors in stages by 25% from the 1991-95 IPEDS averages, plus 3)
              increase the number of racial/ethnic minorities and women enrolling as first
              time full-time CSEM students in stages by 25% from the the 1994-98 IPEDS
              averages for each group.

A distinctive feature of this "Start Right" Program
              is the partner community agencies serving as "linking pins" to the cluster
              communities of Blacks and Latinos in nearby towns, providing assistance in
              recruiting and serving as neighborhood-based support sites. Project directors
              envision a mentoring continuum linking the college's current efforts to
              programs run by these agencies, with e-mail being a key tool to increase
              contact between mentors and CSEM students. They hope to establish Online
              Outposts at these agencies to host workshops for parents and other events and
              also to serve as mentoring, peer tutoring and carpool sites.
