Abstract    :
              The project will develop, implement and assess a scholarship program, July 1,
              2000 - June 30, 2002. The mission of the Program is to provide opportunities to
              40 low-income, academically talented students that promote full-time enrollment
              and degree achievement in the targeted disciplines. Applying an existing
              infrastructure to the Program is envisioned to generate higher retention rates
              of students most at-risk not completing their degree program. 

A unique
              collaboration is proposed between the School of Engineering, the Departments of
              Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science, and the Office of Minority Student
              Affairs to identify and select 40 participants, provide sufficient support
              services to graduate 95% of the participants, provide faculty mentors for the
              participants, and implement a series of workshops to engage participants in
              research and community service activities relevant to their degree program. A
              tracking system will be designed to address issues that emerge during the life
              of the project, follow-up to determine postgraduate plans and activities, and
              on-going academic performance to meet scholarship requirements. 

The
              proposed Program will be an opportunity to research and address issues that
              affect retention and graduation of continuing students. Generally, continuing
              students are assumed to have acquired the resources and skills necessary to
              succeed on their own, however it is our experience that this may not be the
              case. Instead, students facing persistent financial challenges are less likely
              to complete their degree in a timely manner, require some intervention to
              maintain their focus, and guidance into the next phase of their academic and
              professional journey. The Program is designed to enable at-risk students to
              remain in a position to succeed academically, graduate and enter a professional
              field.
