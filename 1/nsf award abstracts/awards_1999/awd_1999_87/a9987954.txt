Abstract    :
              This combined experimental and theoretical project focuses on the study of
              collisions of electrons with excited Rydberg atoms in the energy range around
              one electron volt.  This work marks a redirection of earlier NSF-supported
              efforts in this area toward the goal of addressing a significant gap in the
              knowledge of cool plasmas in the interstellar medium.  The investigations will
              focus on near-elastic state-changing collisions and electron impact ionization
              of selected Rydberg states n=20 to 40.  Experimentally, a new trochoidal
              electron monochromator will be used to access the energy range desired. 
              Theoretically, newly developed techniques, including hidden crossing and
              Sturmian methods to study Coulomb breakup close to threshold, will be applied
              to the electron-Rydberg system.  In addition to the in-house faculty and
              students, faculty co-investigators and students from two neighboring
              undergraduate institutions are involved as participants in the research.
