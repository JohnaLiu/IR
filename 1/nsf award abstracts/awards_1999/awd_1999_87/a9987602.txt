Abstract    :
              The main premise behind the project is that variation at the microeconomic level
              is important for understanding variation at the macroeconomic level. Our
              research agenda involves the development and evaluation of heterogeneous agent,
              general equilibrium life-cycle models which are amenable to quantitative
              analysis and which provide for an effective interaction with panel data on
              income, earnings, consumption and wealth. The economic questions to which we
              apply this methodology include: the implications of time variation in measures
              of inequality for understanding stock market behavior; the importance of the
              intergenerational risk sharing role played by social security and the welfare
              implications of various reforms; and the importance of imperfect risk sharing
              for understanding inequality in income, wealth and consumption. Future work
              will include optimal portfolio choice over the life cycle, the implications of
              changes in demographic structure for financial markets, questions related to
              housing and portfolio choice, and the extent to which extreme events at the
              microeconomic level have important consequences for aggregate prices and
              quantities.
The outcome of the project should be a deeper understanding of the
              implications of cross-sectional variation for aggregate outcomes, financial
              markets and asset prices. The long- term goal is to contribute to the
              development of a class of macroeconomic and financial models in which
              cross-sectional distributions play a fundamental role.
