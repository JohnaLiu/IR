This award supports collaboration between the Virginia
              Institute of Marine Science, and the National Institute of Water and
              Atmospheric Research, New Zealand, on the role of spatially complex shoreface
              roughness in sediment transport and deposition.  The proposal requests funds to
              determine if spatially variable bed roughness causes a corresponding pattern in
              sediment flux divergence through the effect of roughness on boundary layer and
              sediment dynamics. The support provided will allow VIMS to participate in a
              field and modeling research program being undertaken in New Zealand. 
              Participation in the program will provide an exciting opportunity to collect a
              significant data set that allows sediment resuspension and transport to be
              studied in a complex environment. The collaboration builds on existing research
              in both institutions, and provides several US students the opportunity to
              participate in field research in New Zealand. Additional data collected through
              major field research efforts in NZ will complement data collected with VIMS
              instruments as well as provide a critical mass of researchers addressing this
              complex problem.

This collaborative effort with New Zealand has the
              potential to make progress toward developing a predictive general model for
              nearshore environments, an important goal for both the US and for New Zealand,
              given the value to both countries of understanding coastal environments.
