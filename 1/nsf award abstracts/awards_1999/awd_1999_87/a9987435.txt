Abstract    :
              Programs written in non-object-oriented languages often include conceptual
              objects.  Making the objects explicit makes the program easier to understand
              and to maintain, and increases opportunities for code reuse.  However, manually
              transforming a non-objected -oriented program into an object-oriented one is a
              difficult and time-consuming task.  

The goal of this project is the design
              and implementation of a software-reengineering tool that will improve legacy
              code by making it more object-oriented.  In particular, given a set of
              variables that are to become the fields of a class, the tool will identify code
              segments that should be "extracted out" to become methods of the class.  This
              process will be guided by a set of heuristics for identifying candidate code
              segments, a set of correctness criteria for determining which candidates are
              feasible (i.e., can be extracted into methods while preserving program
              semantics), and a set of evaluation criteria for choosing the best
              candidates.
