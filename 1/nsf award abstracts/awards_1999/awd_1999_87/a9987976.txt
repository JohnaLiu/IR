Abstract    :
              The goal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in the
              Physics and Astronomy Department of Iowa State University is to encourage more
              students to continue their science education in upper-division courses and
              graduate programs, and to help them realize their full potential. Each summer,
              undergraduate students will spend 10 weeks actively engaged in basic research
              projects under the direction of faculty members. Students will be integrated
              into the research groups of their mentors, providing a first-hand view of
              research in an academic setting. Projects will be selected from the following
              areas: condensed matter physics, high energy physics, nuclear physics and
              astronomy and astrophysics. At the end of the summer, students will present
              their research accomplishments in a departmental symposium as well as submit a
              written report. In addition to work in their host research groups, students
              will participate in a collective program that includes weekly lectures,
              tutorials and social activities.
