Abstract    :
              (99), (31), (21), (59) The college is establishing a scholarship program for 40
              of its students per semester majoring in the computer science, engineering,
              engineering technology, and mathematics fields.  The program consists of three
              major components:
1.	Recruitment with an emphasis on those populations
              typically underrepresented in CSEM career fields. Current pre-college programs
              in the college's service area have already identified a significant number of
              potential students from these underrepresented groups.
2.	Academic support to
              provide program participants the tools necessary to succeed at the college as
              well as those tools necessary to seek, obtain, and retain a career in a
              computer science, engineering and mathematics field.
3.    A retention program
              which relies heavily on the positive impact mentors have.
     Students
              desiring entrance in the CSEM Scholarship program must demonstrate that they
              are financially disadvantaged, but academically prepared for the rigorous
              curriculums in the CSEM area.  Upon graduation, the employment status of each
              individual in the CSEM program is monitored for at least six months to
              determine the numbers and percentages of CSEM students who find employment in
              their career field or who transfer on to a four year college or university.
