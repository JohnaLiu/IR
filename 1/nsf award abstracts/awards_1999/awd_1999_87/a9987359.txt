Abstract    :
              Kenneth Hedberg of Oregon State University is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to investigate the structures and
              internal motions of gaseous molecules using electron diffraction.  Such studies
              lead to the determination of bond distances and identify the nature of the
              interatomic forces, of equilibrium constants and thermodynamic properties, of
              vibrational force fields and of rotational torsional potentials and barrier
              heights.  Specific molecules to be studied are (1) fluorinated fullerenes, (2)
              systems effected by internal hydrogen bonding (such as 2-fluoroethylamine,
              2-aminoethanol, 2-chloroethanethiol and 2-nitroethanol), (3) systems with syn-
              and anti- conformations (2,3-diflurobutadiene and 2-dihalopropenoyl halides)
              and (4) chalcogentrihalides of Nb and Ta and Group 13 halides.

These studies
              will provide information on the sizes and structures of molecules with
              different types of bonding and on the vibrational and rotational motions within
              the molecules.  This  will give a deeper understanding of how the bonding
              determines the structure and influences the motions.  This information, and
              data obtained on internal energies and bond strengths, are important to the
              chemical vapor deposition of semi-conductors, treatment of gas effluent
              discharges and volatilization of inorganic melts.
