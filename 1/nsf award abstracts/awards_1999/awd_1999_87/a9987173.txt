Abstract    :
              This proposal to the National Science Foundation requests a grant to administer
              The Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) Program
              at Brevard Community College (BCC).  This program supports scholarships for
              talented, low-income students seeking A.S. degrees in computer science at BCC. 
              The CSEMS Program addresses the needs of the whole student at BCC by providing
              the student with financial, academic, and social support to encourage
              achievement and completion of the degree. 

The program's three objectives
              for each year of the two-year continuing grant are: 

1) To increase by 20%
              completion of the A.S. degree in CISA and CPRA programs by low-income students,
              through providing 66 awards of 32 credits tuition waiver to eligible students.
              

2) To increase by 10% transfer rate to higher education by low-income CISA
              and CPRA students, through providing a professional tutor to assist CSEMS
              Program students year-round.

3) To obtain 100% CSEMS student satisfaction
              with academic support, through establishment of a CSEM Scholarship Club.

The
              program will increase the success of low-income students in a field where they
              are traditionally underrepresented.  The program will also create strengthened
              partnerships between the College and the computer science industry.

Mr.
              Steve B. Johnson, Department Chair of the Computer Science Department at
              Brevard Community College Palm Bay Campus, is the Principal
              Investigator/Scholarship Coordinator for the CSEMS Program.  Mr. Johnson will
              ensure that program objectives are met and progress reports are submitted on a
              timely basis to the National Science Foundation.

The proposal requests a
              total of $218, 380 (or $109,190 each year).  90% of that amount will go for
              scholarships; 10% is for administrative and student support infrastructure
              costs.
