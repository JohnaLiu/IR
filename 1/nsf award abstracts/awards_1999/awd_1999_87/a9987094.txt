Abstract    :
              The Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) program
              at Wright State University (WSU) provides student scholarships to motivate and
              enable the completion of higher education degrees in science, engineering or
              technology fields by scholarly but financially disadvantaged students. The
              program is in accord with the American Competitiveness and Workforce
              Improvement Act of 1998 which addresses the national workforce need to increase
              the number of graduates in CSEMS fields. 

A three-pronged effort was
              designed to provide engineering education opportunities for engineering
              parallel students from Ohio Community Colleges, recipients of NSF-CSEMS
              scholarships from internal/external WSU market sources, graduate CSEMS fellows
              from major Ohio urban cities and Wright STEPP Minority Engineering Program
              (MEP) alum. 

The outcomes of the CSEMS program at WSU are improved education
              for students, increased retention to degree completion, improved professional
              development/employment, increased graduate fellows from underrepresented
              groups, and partnerships between WSU and local corporate entities. The primary
              objective is accomplished by project management leadership in quality sciences,
              cognitive/non- cognitive selection methods, operations research, active
              learning, and technical instruction (assessment, planning, teaching and
              evaluation) supported by existing Wright State University student-support
              infrastructure. The use of Adaptive Branching Techniques was also researched as
              a method of skill assessment to eliminate test bias for underrepresented group
              candidates, improve placement in math courses, and shorten the time to
              graduation using Pareto, Gap and Value analysis.
