The PI
              and co-PI's will execute a theoretical and experimental study of the dynamics
              of gas and vapor bubbles in confined liquid-filled spaces such as small
              channels, semi-enclosed chambers, and others.  The motivation for the work
              consists in the possible application of bubbles in microfluidic systems such as
              pumps, valves, actuators and others.  The strong potential of bubbles for these
              applications consists in their intrinsic simplicity, short time scale, and high
              power density.  Among others, they offer the advantage of actuation without
              mechanical moving parts and the ability to convert acoustic into mechanical
              energy.  Several experiments designed to highlight the fundamental properties
              of such systems will be conducted and mathematical/numerical models for their
              simulation will be developed.

The proposed investigation is considered to be
              a prime example of transferring somewhat classical understanding and approaches
              to a new environment where the reduced length scales will be expressed in new
              behaviors.
