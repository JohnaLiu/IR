Abstract    :
              Wesleyan University is a small liberal arts institution with modest graduate
              programs in the sciences.  The primary purpose of this is to expose our
              undergraduates to a faculty and research environment engaged in competitive
              scholarly research. The eight site stipends provided by this award will help us
              maintain a tradition of undergraduate participation within this research
              environment in a unique way: four of the stipends will be offered to women
              selected from outside of Wesleyan, and four will be offered to our own
              students, women or men.  This accomplishes three things.  First, it will open
              up at least four physics research positions in the northeast area targeted
              exclusively for women.  Second, the internal stipends will provide a
              stabilizing resource for our own summer research undergraduates, and finally,
              the emphasis on women will insure a continued visibility to our efforts to
              recruit women into the physics major.
