Develop a multi-mode spectrograph for the
              Lowell 1.8 meter telescope by modifying the existing grism imaging instrument
              and install a new optics, mechanisms, cryo/refrigerator and focal plans.  This
              modification will enable a field-of-view increase by a factor of 6 to 5
              arc-minutes and enable 0.6 arc-second pixels for JHK (1.0 to 2.5 micrometers). 
              This modification enables the long wavelength cut-off to extend from 2.5 to 5
              microns.  This new high-through put system will enable 20,000 hours of sky
              time.  Astronomical research enabled by this modification include answers to
              questions such as 1) why do most stars form in binaries and clusters?, 2) what
              are the galactic environmental effects on star formation?, 3) what is the
              composition of the lava from IO's volcanoes?, and others.
