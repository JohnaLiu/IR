Abstract    :
              Project Summary
The Texas Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation
              (TCETP) is a Texas A&M University System partnership committed to statewide
              reform of science and mathematics teacher preparation. The 10 TCETP
              universities graduate 25% of teachers certified K-8 and 9-12 in mathematics and
              science in Texas (3,700 teachers/year). TCETP has four connected goals: (1)
              course reform (integrating content, pedagogy, and classroom management); (2)
              recruitment to teaching; (3) support for pre-service and novice teachers
              (integrating early field experiences, student teaching, credentialing,
              induction/novice teacher support, math and science technical internships, and
              informal science experiences); and (4) strengthening systemic connections
              (Texas RSI, Texas SSI, Texas AMP). These goals are grounded on the
              accomplishments of development grant funding that
established the System-wide
              infrastructure for reform and model course reform components requisite for
              systemic change in teacher preparation. The teaching of 
mathematics and
              science K-12 in Texas is significantly affected by the demographics of the
              state (55% of school age children are now either African American or Hispanic)
              unfolding within the context of national standards-based mathematics and
              science reform efforts statewide, including: (1) statewide adoption (1998) of
              the national mathematics and science standards (Texas Essential Knowledge and
              Skills, TEKS) developed under NSF support; (2) alignment of the annual student
              assessment instrument (Texas Assessment of Academic Skills) in mathematics and
              science with the TEKS; and (3) state alignment
(Texas State Board for Educator
              Certification) of the proficiencies required of teachers for state
              certification with the TEKS through the Examination for Certification of
              Educators in Texas (ExCET). TCETP was configured to address the critical issues
              of demographics, diversity, and integration within the statewide systemic
              reform environment.
