Abstract    :
              This research project focuses on the study, both experimentally and
              theoretically, of quantum transport of ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices, in
              particular, in mixed phase space, in billiards, and in quasi-periodic lattices,
              as well as the effects of many body interactions and decoherence.  Some of the
              projects include probing:  1) quantum chaos in time-dependent potentials in a
              regime of mixed phase space, 2) quantum chaos in the quantum billiard, 3)
              transport in quasi-periodic lattices in one and two dimensions, 4) breakdown of
              adiabaticity in the region of strong interactions, and 5) the sensitivity to
              noise and dissipation for local structures in classical phase space.
