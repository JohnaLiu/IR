AMAST Anniversary Meeting, May
              23-27, 2000 in Iowa City, Iowa

ABSTRACT:

The 10th anniversary meeting of
              AMAST is in Iowa City from May 23 to 27, 2000, bringing together researchers
              who previously agreed to cooperate to create the mathematical framework for the
              development of software technology. The AMAST goal is the creation of a
              mathematical methodology for the development of software technology.  It is
              unique among organizations pursuing computing research by the vision of the
              field it can offer and by the balance it can provide to trends in the field. 
              The meeting celebrates past achievements, looks at current trends in using
              formal methods for software development, and adapts AMAST goals to the new
              problems raised by current developments.  This project would provide partial
              support for members of the steering committee, invited speakers, and student
              attendees.
