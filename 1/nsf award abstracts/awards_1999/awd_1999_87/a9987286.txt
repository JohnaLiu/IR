Braun, Douglas
"Acoustic Holography of the Solar Convection Zone
              with GONG Data"
AST-9987286

In this research the principles of seismic
              holography are being used to develop a method of characterizing and imaging the
              acoustic properties of solar active regions.  Using observations collected by
              the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) a broad seismic survey of the Sun
              will be conducted in order to catalog phase-contrast images of sunspots,
              plages, large active region complexes and pores.  From this a general model of
              so-called 'acoustic moats' will be devised in order to determine their thermal
              and convective properties, and the role such phenomena play in the transport of
              heat in and around sunspots.  Using the long-wavelength modes of oscillation,
              the method will be further applied to deep imaging of the solar interior. 
              Extension of this technique to imaging the solar farside surface may provide
              the basis for an important new 'space weather' early warning system.  Large
              solar outbursts, or flares, may cause serious damage to spacecraft,
              communications systems and electric power grids on Earth.  Far side images of
              the Sun may identify potentially dangerous conditions a week or more in
              advance.
