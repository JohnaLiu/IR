Abstract    :
              Internet applications are being rapidly developed and adopted for use in the US
              agricultural system. Yet, to date, there has been little research or
              theoretical development concerning the impacts of Internet technology on the
              structure of value chains in agriculture. The primary goal of this SGER project
              is to inductively construct theoretical models of agricultural value chains and
              to show the impacts of Internet development on them. This goal will be
              accomplished through two complementary activities. First, a literature review
              will be done to understand the adoption and subsequent impacts of two other
              major network technologies - electrification and telephony -- in rural areas.
              This review will provide insight into agricultural value chains, how previous
              technologies have impacted them and the types of impacts that could be expected
              from the adoption of the Internet. The second activity will be to: 1)
              understand how firms producing agricultural inputs, marketing agricultural
              commodities, or processing food products use the Internet to provide
              information, goods, and services to farmers and ranchers; and 2) analyze the
              impacts of the Internet on value chains within the US agricultural system.
