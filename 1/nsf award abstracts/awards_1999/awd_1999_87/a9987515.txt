Abstract    :
              This project will complete data entry from the approximately 220,000 Mexican
              vascular plant research specimens housed in the Plant Resources Center at the
              University of Texas, which comprise the University of Texas Herbarium and the
              Lundell Herbarium.  This database will be a collaborative project among the
              University of Texas, the National University of Mexico, Campus Iztacala
              Herbarium (Mexico), and the Commission for the Understanding and Use of
              Biodiversity of Mexico (CONABIO).  The database will be available on the web,
              and will foster research on the Mexican flora by facilitating data retrieval,
              floristic checklists and floras, and the identification of areas high in
              endemism for their potential conservation.
