Abstract    :
              This award, supports the work of Drs. Jon F. Parcher and Kwang S. Yun at the
              University of Mississippi, is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program. The research continues Dr. Parcher's use of two complimentary
              chromatographic techniques, tracer pulse chromatography and molecular probe
              chromatography, to study the interaction of supercritical fluids with polymers.
               Fundamental investigations include further development and expansion of the
              Sanchez-Lacombe lattice fluid model to interpret experimental chromatographic
              data for single-component, binary, ternary and quaternary systems. In the
              course of the investigations, adsorption isotherms for carbon dioxide in
              polymeric stationary phases will be determined over a range of temperatures and
              pressures for a series of polymers commonly used as SFC stationary phases.
              Adsorption isotherms for binary mixtures of carbon dioxide and various SFC
              modifiers will also be measured over a range of temperatures and pressures to
              provide a three-dimensional array of temperature, pressure and
              composition.

This research develops chromatographic procedures and
              thermodynamic data that are of interest to a variety of researchers interested
              in new and innovative means to investigate complex multicomponent, multiphase
              systems. The results are also  likely to be used in industries where there is
              interest in transport properties, manufacturing, or design of new polymeric
              materials.
