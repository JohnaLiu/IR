Abstract    :
              This project in ultralow-temperature atomic physics is based on the exploitation
              of the phenomenon of Bose Einstein Condensation (BEC).   Bose Einstein
              condensates realize a new class of gaseous quantum fluid, and one goal of the
              research is to study the properties of this new fluid.  These properties
              include collective excitations with special emphasis on the hydrodynamic
              regime, coherence properties, condensates in rotating frames, and the behavior
              of condensates near Feshbach resonances.  The scientific goals will be
              accompanied by advances in manipulating condensates.   A flexible optical setup
              using beam scanning techniques will allow the realization of a great variety of
              trapping potentials.  Finally, the research exploits the properties of
              condensates for application to atom optics.
