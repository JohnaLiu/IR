Abstract    :
              The Stony Brook Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Physics brings 13
              students to the Stony Brook campus each summer for participation in an 8-week
              program of forefront research in the laboratories of Stony Brook Physics and
              Astronomy faculty members. The aim of the program is to encourage interest in
              careers in physics by the actual doing of research in a collegial setting at
              facilities at Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory, by weekly
              seminars on current topics in physics, and finally by oral presentations of
              student research results in a formal symposium and written reports at the
              conclusion of the program. Outstanding projects are submitted for presentation
              at national student research symposia. The program offers research in the areas
              of astronomy, atmospheric physics, high-energy particles, instructional
              laboratory instrumentation, lasers and optics, nuclear physics and condensed
              matter physics. Recruiting efforts concentrate on sophomore and junior level
              physics majors of high academic standing and promise, many from colleges in
              which research opportunities are limited. Particular efforts are made to
              attract women and under-represented minority students.
