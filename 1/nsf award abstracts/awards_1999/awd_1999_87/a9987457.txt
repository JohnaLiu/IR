Abstract    :
              The planned work has the following objectives: 
(1) to understand the processes
              that are most important in determining the future growth of atmospheric CO2 for
              a given anthropogenic CO2 emission scenario, and
(2) to understand how
              atmospheric CO2 growth rate and climate change may co-evolve in future.
The
              principal tool of the investigation will be Community Climate System Model
              (CCSM). The PI proposes to develop and evaluate an interactive carbon module in
              the CSM. Instead of forcing the CSM with specified rates of CO2 growth, they
              will specify fossil fuel CO2 source and allow the model to interactively
              predict the atmospheric CO2 burden, radiative forcing and subsequent climate
              change. Their immediate goal is to examine future rates of atmospheric CO2
              growth and climate change  as a result of climate feedbacks on the carbon
              cycle. The work is important because it will increase our understanding and
              ability to model the carbon cycle in a coupled model framework.
