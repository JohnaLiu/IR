Abstract    :
              This project requests funds for individuals at U.S. institutions to meet the
              costs of participating in the 8th Congress of the International Society of
              Developmental and Comparative Immunology (ISDCI), scheduled for 3-7 July, 2000
              in Cairns, Australia. The ISDCI major objective is to foster and maintain
              international scientific cooperation as well as communication between
              individual scientists, regional groups, and National Societies interested in
              developmental and comparative immunology. This objective is achieved by
              organizing an International Congress every three years. The Congress provides a
              variety of formats for the presentation of results and scientific discussions
              and an excellent forum in which younger Society members are encouraged to
              present their own results and to interact with senior Society members. 
              Participants of the Congress will cover recent advances in the field: advances
              in the evolution of the immune systems at the cellular, molecular and genetic
              levels as well as advances in the adaptation of the immune defense system of
              various organisms in different environments.
