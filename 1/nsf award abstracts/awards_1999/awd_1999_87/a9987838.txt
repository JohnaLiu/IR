Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Dr. Karin
              Ruhlandt-Senge and other members of the Chemistry Department at Syracuse
              University in establishing and conducting a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002 36
              undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each conducting summer research
              under the supervision of Chemistry faculty. The theme of the project will be
              Molecular and Biomolecular Electronics, in which most Syracuse chemistry
              faculty will participate, and will encompass projects in organic, inorganic and
              physical as well as biological chemistry.  In addition to individual research
              projects students will attend faculty seminars reviewing frontier research in
              the theme area, weekly faculty tutorials on the participant's research project,
              weekly student presentations, workshops on specialized research techniques,
              weekly research group meetings and mini courses on topics of interest in
              chemical research such as the use of X-ray crystallography and construction of
              glass apparatus. Each student will present a poster and prepare a paper for
              submission to the Journal of Student Research on her/his project.
