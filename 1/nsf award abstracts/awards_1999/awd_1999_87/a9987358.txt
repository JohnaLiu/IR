Abstract

A very innovative approach to sense an
              atmospheric wavefront distortion with Rayleigh beacons is being developed.  A
              near diffraction-limited laser emitting ultra-violet pulses of < 100
              nanoseconds will project columns of light whose instantaneous volume is a near
              cylindrical shape < 30 meters long by < 10 centimeters wide within the optical
              wavefront-phase perturbing atmospheric medium.  A  portion of the turbulent
              atmosphere is frozen in time by the <100 nanosecond pulse. Radiation will
              Rayleigh backscatter optical phase information characteristic of that volume
              into the telescope.  This scene information will be used to create a real-time
              volumetric tomographic map of the 3-D character of the turbulence.  Signals
              from this volume phase map will drive a multiple-plane Adaptive-Optics system
              to correct for atmospheric turbulence over a wide isoplanatic patch. Systems
              design and limited hardware prototypes will be designed built and tested to
              verify theory.  An important aspect of this innovative idea is how well do the
              theoretical expectations for wavefront accuracy and resolution can be realized
              on an astronomical telescope such as the 6.5-meter MMT.
