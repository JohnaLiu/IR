Abstract    :
              This project is the third phase of improvements to the vertebrate paleontology
              collection at the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, University of Oklahoma,
              specifically to computerize and verify data for the collection.  The collection
              comprises 57,000 specimens, and is a national resource particularly strong in
              Permian vertebrates, Jurassic dinosaurs, Cretaceous microvertebrates, and
              Miocene mammals.  The proposed collection computerization program will improve
              accuracy of records and efficiency in collection management and will facilitate
              handling of specific information requests.  In addition, because the OMNH
              collection is geographically isolated and its contents are not widely known,
              the investigators expect that accessibility of the data will result in greatly
              increased specimen usage (via visitation or transactions).  Availability of the
              data on the web in fully searchable databases will allow researchers worldwide
              to access these otherwise unaccessible and invaluable specimens.
