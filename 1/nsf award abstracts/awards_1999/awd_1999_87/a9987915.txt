The National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN) is a
              national partnership of user research facilities providing unparalled
              opportunities for researchers from many disciplines and organizations.  The
              facilities are used to fabricate structures based on advanced nano- and
              micro-fabrication technology.  Initiated by NSF in 1994 NNUN serves as a useful
              model for linking expensive facilities to gain synergy and minimize
              duplication.  Approximately 1000 active users take advantage of one of the five
              NNUN facilities each year.  NNUN established a network-wide REU site in 1997,
              involving 42 students per summer for 10 weeks at 5 campuses:  Cornell, Howard
              University, Penn State, Stanford, and University of California-Berkeley.  The
              intent of this REU program is to capitalize on the extensive interrelated
              infrastructure of NNUN to provide a much broader and richer REU experience than
              any one site could provide.  Students have access to state-of-the-art
              instrumentation and expertise in nanofabrication.  A large pool of faculty,
              collectively from all 5 campuses, is available to advise the students.  The REU
              program is individual project-based, with each student individually responsible
              for a research project.  An REU convocationis held at the end of each summer at
              one of the 5 campuses; all 42 students meet to present their results in a
              conference setting.  Other features of this REU include multi-site
              collaborative opportunities by delivery of training through streaming video and
              by expanded cooperative projects involving students at multiple sites working
              on similar or related projects.
