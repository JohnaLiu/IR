Abstract    :
              This project has as its goal the determination of an electric dipole moment
              (EDM) for the electron.  Should a non-zero value for this parameter exist, this
              would provide definitive evidence for phenomena beyond the Standard Model of
              particle physics.  The experiment will search for the EDM through the
              metastable excited a(1) state of PbO.  The sensitivity of the experiment should
              reach an improvement over the current limit to which the EDM is known by four
              orders of magnitude and should be able to access EDM values much smaller than
              those predicted by theories beyond the Standard Model.  Part of the work will
              be conducted in collaboration with faculty and students from Amherst College.
