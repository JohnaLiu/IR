Abstract    :
              The Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University houses one of the
              premier collections of invertebrate fossils in the US.  Since its founding by
              Louis Agassiz in the 1850s, the collection has served as an important resource
              for researchers from the US and abroad, housing over 10,000 types and more than
              a million specimens.  However, while the collection has not been neglected,
              neither has it been much improved over the course of the last century.  It now
              falls below the standards that one might expect for a collection of its size
              and significance.  The primary goals for modernization of the invertebrate
              fossil collection are to assemble together in high security cases the types and
              other valuable specimens now scattered throughout the collection; to add,
              replace, and renovate the housing for the remainder of the collection,
              including installation of compactors; and to computerize the collection into a
              fully searchable web-based database.
