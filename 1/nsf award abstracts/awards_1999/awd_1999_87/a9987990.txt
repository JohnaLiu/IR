Abstract    :
              A theoretical and experimental investigation will be made of the propagation of
              intense
femtosecond laser pulses through transparent solids and gases under a
              wide variety of conditions.  These studies will characterize the temporal,
              spatial, and spectral dynamics for the case in which the input power is above
              the threshold power for catastrophic self-focusing collapse. Regimes of study
              include the case in which the plasma formation plays a dominant role, and the
              possibility will be explored that a three-dimensional soliton pulse localized
              in space and time can be produced. Nonlinear propagation dynamics of ultrashort
              pulses through hollow-core waveguides filled with a noble gas will also be
              investigated, and it is expected this system will offer novel dynamics that are
              not present in interactions with bulk media. The proposed research will have
              implications for various areas of ultrafast science including femtosecond laser
              damage, long-range pulse propagation in optical media, and parametric and
              harmonic generation in gases with ultrashort pulses.
