Dr. Ayres is
              investigating the atmospheres of solar-type stars using observational and
              theoretical data for carbon monoxide (CO).  The presence of relatively cool
              (T~3500K) CO molecules at high altitudes in the hot (T~7000K) solar atmosphere
              is a long-standing puzzle in solar physics, since in this region only hot
              chromospheric gas should exist and molecules are quite unexpected.  In the Sun
              CO is found in the middle of the transition region that separates the
              kinetically controlled plasma of the photosphere and the magnetically
              controlled gas of the corona.  This region is expected to provide important
              diagnostic clues to Solar activity levels and, indirectly, to the Sun-Earth
              interactions during the solar activity cycle.  Dr. Ayres is extending this
              research to other solar-type stars using observations at the 5 micron infrared
              region where CO transitions are detectable to probe the cool side of this
              magnetic transition zone.  This complements the visible and ultraviolet
              observations that probe the hotter regime.  The primary objectives of this work
              are to: (1) use CO observations to investigate solar active regions;  (2)
              investigate the low chromospheric structure at the solar limb;  (3) survey the
              CO spectra of solar type stars; and (4) construct two-dimensional static models
              of the solar and stellar atmospheres that incorporate dynamic CO formation and
              destruction processes.
