Abstract    :
              The University of Southern Mississippi is supporting scholarships for students
              in nine programs through the Computer Science, Mathematics, and Engineering
              Scholarship (CSEMS) program. Low income, academically bright undergraduate
              students are being selected from computer science, mathematics, and seven
              engineering technology programs. Graduate students are being chosen from
              master's level programs in engineering technology, computer science and
              mathematics.

The program is partnering with three existing programs, the
              Alliance for Minority Participation, sponsored by the National Science
              Foundation, and TRIO and Ronald McNair Programs sponsored by the U.S.
              Department of Education. The existing programs have many of the same objectives
              as the CSEMS Program, providing academic and financial support for different
              student populations. Still, there are many students who meet CSEMS Program
              criteria who are not eligible to participate. This program is enabling the
              university to include all undergraduate students in engineering technology,
              mathematics, and computer science who meet CSEMS criteria.

The objectives of
              the proposed program are directly related to the CSEMS Program purpose of
              enabling low income students to complete baccalaureate and graduate degrees in
              academic areas of high priority. CSEMS Scholarship recipients are sharing
              facilities and participating in academic enrichment activities already in place
              to support the three ongoing programs.
