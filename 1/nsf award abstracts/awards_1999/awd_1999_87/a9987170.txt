Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31), Engineering - Other (59), Mathematical Sciences (21) The
              NSF/CCNY CSEM Scholars Program, aims to educate and support talented,
              financially disadvantaged students leading them to earn either a baccalaureate
              or a master's degree, and preparing them to assume leadership positions in the
              fields of computer science, engineering, or mathematical sciences. Besides
              financial assistance through scholarships, the program adds critical supports
              for student learning, growth of self-confidence, career motivation, and
              long-term success. Four objectives guide this project: (1) enable all NSF/CSEM
              Scholars to enroll as fulltime, rather than part-time students; (2) improve the
              quality of the Scholars' education through participation in out-of-class
              enrichment activities.; (3) enhance overall retention and graduation rates so
              that all NSF/CSEM Scholars maintain continuing enrollment and achieve their
              degrees within the two-year project period; and (4) motivate all NSF/CSEM
              Scholars for graduate study with a minimum of 60% of the undergraduate Scholars
              enrolling in graduate programs. Because of the character of the City College
              student population, the project is also serving to increase the number of
              minorities who are trained in these technical fields and prepared to fill key
              management positions. The project is supporting forty scholars per year for the
              two-year project period, at $2500/each. Thirty of the scholarship recipients
              are undergraduates and ten are master's students.
