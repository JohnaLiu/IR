Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Dr. Joanne L. Stewart
              and other members of the Chemistry Department at Hope College in continuing a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period
              2000-2002 24 undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each conducting summer
              research under the supervision of Chemistry faculty. Participants will work in
              close professional partnership with faculty research mentors in the laboratory.
              The mentor will guide the student in all facets of professional development
              including literature search, design and conduct of experiments and interpreting
              and documenting results for presentation and/or publication. In addition to
              laboratory research each student will present a departmental seminar, prepare a
              research report and present a poster at the research symposium at the end of
              the summer.
