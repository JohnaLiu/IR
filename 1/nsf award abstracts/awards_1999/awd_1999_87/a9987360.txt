This award supports a feasibility study of a Bolometric
              Array Receiver for Measurements of Polarization of the Cosmic Microwave
              Background Radiation.  This instrument would search for polarization at
              millimeter wavelengths using a bolometer array that will simultaneously observe
              40 pixels on the sky in two orthogonal directions of linear polarization.  The
              receiver would be mounted on a 1.5m telescope sited at Mauna Kea, Hawaii, a
              location that combines superb observing conditions with a cheap, convenient
              location that has good existing support facilities.  The instrument would be
              optimized to observe at frequencies of 100 to 220 GHz to allow the tiny
              polarized signal to be distinguished from astrophysical foregrounds.  This
              instrument would allow a precise measurement of the power spectrum of
              polarization modes over an l-range of 50 to 1000.
