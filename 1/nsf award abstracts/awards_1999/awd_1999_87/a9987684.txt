This is a proposal to study middle atmosphere
              electrodynamics and coupling between the atmosphere and ionosphere.  From
              November 1992 through April 1993 one of the most extensive data sets on
              atmospheric electrodynamics was collected using superpressure balloons in the
              stratosphere.  The experiment, called ELBBO: Extended Life Balloon Borne
              Observatories, included vector electric field and related electrodynamic
              measurements, and was sponsored jointly by the National Science Foundation
              (grant ATM 8920428) and by NASA.  Overall the ELBBO experiment was very
              successful and collected high quality data from five payloads, and included
              record breaking flight duration at this altitude (26 km).  The first of four
              related research goals of this proposed new effort has to do with a detailed
              analysis of the new source of horizontal electric fields: evidence of this new
              source has now been found in the ELBBO data set.  Additional goals have to do
              with other middle atmosphere electrodynamics questions relating to ways in
              which local variability can effect global circuit dynamics.  In addition,
              coupling to the neutral atmosphere and the influence of magnetic storms on
              middle atmospheric electrodynamics will be investigated.
