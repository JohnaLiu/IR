This project will explore the mathematical depth of the
              abstract notion of computation, as well as explore its connections to other
              sciences.  The cross-fertilization between theoretical computer science and the
              other sciences and the education of scientists prepared for the science of the
              future will be major goals of a new program of the School of mathematics at the
              Institute for Advanced Study.  The grant mainly supports postdoctoral
              visitors.
Postdoctoral education at the Institute for Advanced Study is unique
              in that the Institute's small size, coupled with the extraordinary dedication
              of the permanent Faculty to their roles as mentors of young scientists, creates
              an unusually productive atmosphere for interaction.  The research environment
              at the Institute is intellectually challenging because it is both deep and
              sustained.  The intense and extended process that occurs at the Institute
              cannot happen in the course of a short-term exposure of computer scientists to
              mathematicians and to other scientists in other situations.  What happens at
              the Institute is extended immersion, and we feel that there is no institution
              where this challenging and unusual educational process can occur as well as at
              the Institute.
