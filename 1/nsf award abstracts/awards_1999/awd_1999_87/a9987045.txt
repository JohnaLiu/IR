Partial funding is sought to design and
              build a Multi-Object Double Spectrograph (MODS) for the Large Binocular
              Telescope (LBT).  The instrument will have a range of intermediate spectral
              resolutions (103 to 106) for a 0.6 arc-second wide slit.  It will deliver high
              throughout from 320 to 1000 Nanometers wavelengths through the use of two
              separate optical channels, one optimized for the blue, the other for the red. 
              The spectrograph will use an open architecture, modular design approach with a
              minimum number of optical elements.  The design is innovative as demonstrated
              by its capability to accept a forecasted Adaptive Optics (A/O)
              unit.

Research activities include the formation and evolution of galaxies
              and the origin of structure in the universe.
