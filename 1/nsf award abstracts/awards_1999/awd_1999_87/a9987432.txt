Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              supports research by Gerard F. R. Parkin of the Department of Chemistry,
              Columbia University, on synthesis of novel main group compounds. The s- and
              p-block compounds prepared will feature currently unknown functionalities, such
              as a terminal gallium nitride unit.  The syntheses of these complexes will rely
              upon the use of ligands constructed so as to stabilize the functionalities
              under investigation. These include various tris-(pyrazolyl)borate and bis- and
              tris-(mercaptoimidazolyl)hydroborate ligands, chiral-at-boron ligands, and
              ligands featuring monovalent gallium as the donor atom.

The main group
              elements have a variety of important applications in synthetic chemistry, 
              solid state materials, and catalytic reactions. This project aims at
              understanding some of the unusual bonding and structural properties of some of
              the heavier members of the s- and p-block of the periodic table. Understanding
              gallium-nitride bonding may provide some insight into gas phase routes to
              materials.  Graduate and postdoctoral students will learn rigorous synthetic
              methodologies and participate in group projects.
