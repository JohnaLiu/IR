Abstract    :
              The project is designed to increase the number of students, especially women and
              minorities, who successfully graduate from engineering or computer technology
              associate degree programs at these two partnering institutions. The two
              colleges are partnering to provide scholarship assistance and other support
              services to students who have the academic and professional abilities to
              successfully complete an associate degree program, but who lack the financial
              resources to enroll full time. This project addresses the local and state-wise
              need for more engineering and computer technology graduates to support
              manufacturing industries in remaining competitive in the global marketplace.
              The primary target audience of the Scholars' Initiative is the pool of
              Pell-eligible students who are currently enrolled part time in degree programs
              but who lack the financial resources to enroll full time. A marketing campaign
              will also promote the scholarship program to local industries and to all
              incoming students at the partner colleges. An interview component of the
              evaluation process will provide important information regarding the
              effectiveness of scholarship programs in increasing retention and degree
              completion rates among low-income students.
