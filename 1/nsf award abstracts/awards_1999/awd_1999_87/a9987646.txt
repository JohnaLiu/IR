Abstract    :
              This project, which is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program
              conducts fundamental studies on the effects of analyte molecules on current
              flow through membranes.  Conducted by Dr. Charles Martin and his group at the
              University of Florida, the research uses a membrane containing gold nanotubes
              to detect analyte concentrations by measuring  enhanced resistance as an
              analyte molecule passes through the membrane.  The tubes are of molecular
              dimensions (< 1 nm) and extraordinarily low detection limits are possible.  The
              project addresses four main areas; 1) the mechanism by which the analyte is
              transferred from the bulk solution to the mouths of the nanotubes, 2) the
              nature of the partitioning of the analyte into the nanotubes, 3) the role of
              hindered diffusion of the analyte within the nanotubes on the response
              mechanism, and 4) the fundamental detection limits achievable by this device.
              

This research develops basic information on how membranes containing gold
              nanotubes can be used to analyze extremely low levels of organic species. 
              Information from this research  will be useful to determine the size and number
              of extremely small (eg virus) particles.
