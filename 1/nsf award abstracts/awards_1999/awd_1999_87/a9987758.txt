Abstract    :
              This project is a continuation of a study of Rydberg wave packets in
              two-electron systems.  Experiments that will be undertaken include an
              investigation of double Rydberg wave packets, a study of inner electron
              multi-photon ionization of atoms with one electron in a wave packet state, a
              study of quantum beats of a two-electron wave packet, and the use of a short
              pulse laser in laser-induced stabilization of an autoionizing state.  Systems
              will be studied in which spectroscopic investigation of the energy eigenstates
              provides an incomplete physical understanding of the system, and temporal
              studies will provide additional and complementary information.
