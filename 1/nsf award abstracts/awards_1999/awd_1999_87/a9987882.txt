Abstract    :
              This project capitalizes on the recent achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation
              in atomic hydrogen to study the behavior of the condensate as a quantum gas. 
              Problems that will be addressed include investigations of the anomalous
              behavior observed in the 1S-2S two-photon spectrum in the normal gas near the
              transition, the dynamics of formation and evolution of the condensate, the
              density distribution beyond the Thomas-Fermi approximation, interactions of a
              condensate with a surface, and dynamical effects predicted for the condensate.
