Award is for a multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection
              survey of three well-developed structural exposures of deep-crustal plutonic
              and upper-mantle ultramafic rock that occur on the flanks of the Mid-Atlantic
              Ridge.  These smoothly-domed, "turtleback" shaped exposures, termed
              megamullions, apparently represent detachment fault surfaces associated with
              extensional processes at the nearby spreading ridge, and are characterized by
              extensive and prominent corrugations (mullion structures).  These MCS surveys
              should establish the upper seismic velocity structure of these megamullions
              both laterally and vertically, and will give insight both into the deep nature
              of the oceanic crust and upper mantle now exposed in these megamullions as well
              as give a better understanding of how and why megamullions form. This survey
              would also serve as a foundational site survey to Ocean Drilling Program (ODP)
              proposals 512-Full and 532-Full and addresses several crustal objectives of the
              ODP Long Range Plan.
