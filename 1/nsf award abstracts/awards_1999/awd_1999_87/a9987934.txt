Oklahoma State University continues operation of a Research
              Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The theme of the REU Site is Optical
              Materials and Lasers.  The REU Site is hosted by the Department of Physics and
              the Center for Laser and Phonics Research at the University.  Ten undergraduate
              students are recruited every year for an eight-week summer research experience.
               Student research projects address laser-host, electro-optic, photorefractive,
              biological and colloidal materials with present or potential applications in
              optical systems.  In addition, students participate in weekly research seminars
              and in field trips to nearby industrial research facilities.

This project
              addresses a scientific and engineering area of significant economic importance.
               The REU Site at Oklahoma State introduces young scientists to this important
              field at a formative stage in their careers.
