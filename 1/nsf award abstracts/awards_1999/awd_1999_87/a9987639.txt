This award supports 17 participants (seven US and ten
              African) in the US-West Africa Workshop on Global and Regional Models for West
              African Climate Systems, to be held in Washington, DC, in May 2000.  Additional
              participants include representatives from IGBP/START and GEF (Global
              Environmental Fund), as well as climatologists and modelers from local
              universities and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The
              co-organizers are Dr. Gregory S. Jenkins, of the Department of Meteorology at
              Pennsylvania State University, and Dr. Adamou Garba, of the Laboratory for
              Atmospheric Physics at Cheik Anta Diop University in Senegal.

During the
              past several decades West Africa has experienced extreme variability in its
              precipitation amounts.  It has been observed that this variability is
              inextricably related to land-use change, especially vegetation-climate
              interactions, but little is known about the cause and effect mechanisms of such
              interactions.  Modeling techniques that have been adapted to use West African
              climate data should lead to a better understanding of such interactions.  The
              participants will assess the current status of global modeling efforts that are
              focused on the relationships among West African rainfall and global sea surface
              temperatures, land-use changes, and elevated greenhouse gases.  New areas of
              research and new modeling techniques will be explored to determine the
              anticipated benefits they can provide to future studies on climate variability
              in West Africa.

The workshop will foster interactions among and between US
              and West African scientists and modelers.  The resultant projects will help
              increase the current knowledge about climate variability in West Africa,
              especially as it is related to land-use changes.  This grant will support the
              participation of four junior researchers from the United States and two junior
              researchers from West Africa.  This project is being jointly funded by the
              Division of International Programs and the Division of Atmospheric Sciences.
