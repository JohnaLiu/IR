Abstract    :
              Recent theoretical work in quantum optics has revealed deep connections between
              measurement and decoherence, which may be understood as dynamical counterparts
              of the connection between information and entropy.  This progress has largely
              been enabled by quantum trajectory theory, which we seek to verify
              experimentally.  To do so we will first implement and test quantitatively two
              advanced methods for real-time quantum measurement (adaptive homodyne detection
              and quantum Kalman filtering), which have
been derived on the basis of quantum
              trajectory theory.  We will then utilize these techniques in experiments on
              hypersensitivity to perturbations, quantifying the amount of information that
              must continuously be gathered about environmental perturbations to keep the
              entropy of a system below a fixed value.  Quantum trajectory theory provides a
              basis for predicting how this quantity should vary with the complexity of the
              observed system's dynamics.
