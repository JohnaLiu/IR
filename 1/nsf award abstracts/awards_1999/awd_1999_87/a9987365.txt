The Summer FASEB Research Conference
              on Virus Assembly is a biennial conference dealing with the structure and
              assembly of viruses, and brings together investigators working in diverse virus
              systems including those present in bacteria, archea, plants and animals. 
              Information will be integrated from studies using a wide variety of technical
              approaches, including biophysical techniques including X-ray crystallography,
              electron microscopy, spectroscopy, biochemical and molecular biology
              investigations and molecular genetic analyses.  The meeting should generate new
              ways of looking at virus assembly mechanisms and interpretation of virus
              structures.  A high priority will be given to the inclusion of young
              investigators, investigators from underrepresented ethnic groups and those from
              financially disadvantaged countries.
