              ABSTRACT

Bieging, John
"Mass Loss & Dust Formation in AGB & post-AGB
              Stars"
AST-9987408

This investigation addresses several problems associated
              with the mass loss processes in intermediate mass stars during the late stages
              of their evolution.  The work will proceed along three main avenues: (1) a
              study of molecular line emission as a probe of pulsationally driven shocks in
              outflowing material; (2) high resolution imaging in the millimeter wavelength
              region to map the initial stages of mass loss via the distribution of gas near
              evolving stars; and (3) a spectrophotometric study of the composition and
              distribution of dust that forms during the outflow process.  
Funding for this
              project was provided by the NSF program for Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics
              (AST/SAA).
