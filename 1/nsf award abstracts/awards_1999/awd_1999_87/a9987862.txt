Abstract    :
              This project investigates a novel problem in inverse scattering, the
              determination of the shape and refractive index of a transparent object from
              the position of the rainbow caustics of light scattered by it.   The work will
              examine experimentally the rainbow position of light scattered from a
              transparent cylinder with a non-circular cross section as a function of the
              angle of rotation.   Preliminary results indicate that the cross sectional
              shape is encoded into the coefficients of the Fourier series expansion of the
              deviation of the primary and secondary rainbow angles.  An accompanying model
              is used to explain the data.
