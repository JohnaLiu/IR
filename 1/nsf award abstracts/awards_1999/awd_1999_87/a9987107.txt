Abstract    :
              WThis scholarship program is providing support to 25 undergraduate students
              enrolled in the fields of Computer Science, Mathematics and Management and
              Information Systems. In addition to the scholarships, the institution is
              providing tutoring, mentoring and counseling to the participants in order to
              strengthen student retention and to ensure graduation within the program's time
              constraints. Students are selected for the program based on their financial
              status, their current grade point average and their leadership abilities. Since
              nearly 25 percent of the institution's enrollment is American Indian the
              scholarship program is also helping to address the underrepresentation of
              minority populations in science and engineering fields. Recruitment takes place
              through advertisements in local and area newspapers and radio and cable
              television stations, brochures and announcements at local and area junior
              colleges and in tribal newspapers and events. Students are required to have
              completed a minimum of fifty hours of undergraduate credit and to have gained
              acceptance into the Mathematics, Computer Science or Management and Information
              Systems programs.
