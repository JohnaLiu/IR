Dr. Smith proposes to investigate the reasons why the
              chemical abundances of stars vary within a given population such as a globular
              cluster, dwarf spheroidal galaxy or the Magellanic Clouds.  The chemical
              abundances of a wide range of elements will be determined in a large sample of
              stars found in such diverse systems.  The analysis utilizes the latest stellar
              model atmospheres and atomic/molecular data.  The particular elements and
              stellar systems chosen permit an examination of how chemical evolution depends
              upon stellar masses and lifetimes and in principle .  The spectroscopic
              observations essential to the project will be obtained with the Hobby-Eberly
              Telescope, Kitt Peak National Observatory and Cerro Tololo Inter-American
              Observatory.     
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for
              Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
