Abstract    :
              (99), (59), (58), (31), (35), (21) The CSEMS project is designed to closely
              blend the university's faculty and staff, the local business community, and 40
              talented but financially disadvantaged students enrolled in computer science,
              computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics
              baccalaureate programs. The project is designed to offer the 40 prospective
              scholars a $2500 per year CSEM Scholarship for two years (based on need and
              eligibility) and an opportunity for involvement in a business/laboratory
              setting with a mentor from the community in the student's major field of study.
              The project, in addition to addressing the scholars' academic and curricular
              needs, provides the students with a support system of career counseling,
              faculty and local business mentors, special programs, and other
              institutionalized services.  The intent is to increase the number of women and
              minorities in the fields of computer science, computer technology, engineering,
              engineering technology, or mathematics.  Emphasis is placed on locating
              qualified students in the CSEM areas for the project. By providing educational
              opportunities to low-income, academically talented students through
              scholarships that promote full-time enrollment and degree achievement in higher
              education, the university expects improved education for students in computer
              science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, or
              mathematics; increased retention of students to degree achievement; improved
              professional development and employment/further higher education placement of
              participating students; and strengthened partnerships between the university
              and CSEM related employment sectors.
