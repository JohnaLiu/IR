Abstract    :
              The Department of Entomology at the American Museum of Natural History houses
              13,500 specimens of fossil insects, including 624 types.  The main strengths
              are fossils in amber, Cretaceous fossils, and sizeable historical collection of
              insects in Oligocene shales from Florissant, Colorado, that has received
              virtually no curation for 80 years.  This proposal seeks to complete
              preparation and cataloguing of several thousand amber and compression fossil
              specimens; to identify approximately 2000 specimens; to house the compression
              fossils in new drawers; to prepare all types and other important amber
              specimens for long-term conservation; and to create high-resolution Computed
              Tomography images of selected specimens.  In addition, the project will
              investigate new technology such as High-Resolution Soft-Xray imaging as a means
              to generate data from damaged and degraded amber sources.
