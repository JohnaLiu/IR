Abstract    :
              This group effort focuses on a broad research project combining ultracold
              science and high-resolution laser spectroscopy.  The project consolidates the
              efforts of three investigators, who already have a history of working on
              collaborative projects, in order to enhance the interactions among the
              investigators and their students and accelerate progress in the rapidly
              developing field of ultracold atomic and molecular science.  The group will
              address, in a broad fashion, various issues in the production and utilization
              of ultracold atoms and, especially, ultracold molecules.   Various directions
              will be explored, including multiple-resonance spectroscopy of high-lying
              states of molecules, the behavior of highly-excited Rydberg atoms and ultracold
              plasmas, and high-resolution precision measurements.  The project is jointly
              supported by the Atomic, Molecular, Optical, and Plasma Physics program and the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry program.
