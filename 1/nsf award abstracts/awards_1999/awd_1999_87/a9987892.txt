This program will build upon substantial investments by the
              W. M. Keck Foundation and NSF to continue the highly successful Keck Geology
              Consortium undergraduate research program.  A primary goal is to maintain the
              synergy created by the existing collaborative program while including more
              students and faculty from other institutions.  Twenty-seven students and nine
              faculty drawn from institutions nationwide will participate in three
              collaborative research projects.  The projects will begin in the spring when
              students will investigate the literature and become familiar with their
              research area.  Each research group will work together for approximately four
              weeks in the summer.  During this time each student will define an individual
              project that contributes to the research group's broader goals and will begin
              collecting data.  The research will continue through the academic year under
              the guidance of an on-compus sponsor.  Funds will be available for six sponsors
              to visit their students during the summer to increase the quality of advising. 
              The student work will culminate in the preparation of a paper evaluated for
              credit at their home institution, a presentation at an annual consortium
              research symposium, and a four-page contribution to the symposium proceedings. 
              Students are also encouraged to present their results at professional society
              meetings and to work with faculty on joint publications.
