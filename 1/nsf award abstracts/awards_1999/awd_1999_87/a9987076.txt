Abstract    :
              Higher education faces the challenge of expanding the educational opportunities
              in computer science, engineering and mathematics to traditionally
              underrepresented groups. Meeting this challenge is essential for the United
              States to be able to maintain its technological leadership and to continue to
              improve the standard of living for all its citizens. The University of North
              Texas is uniquely positioned to increase access to higher education for
              low-income academically talented students in the rapidly growing Dallas-Fort
              Worth metropolitan area. The overall objective of the proposed program is to
              utilize the NSF Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarship
              Program to expand the opportunities of economically disadvantaged students in
              the Dallas-Fort Worth region and to provide an enhanced educational experience
              through a comprehensive program of instruction, student research and work
              experience.
