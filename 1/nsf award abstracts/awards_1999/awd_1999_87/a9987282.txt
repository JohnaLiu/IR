Abstract    :
              The California Community College Transfer Scholarship Consortium is a statewide
              effort to develop better prepared transfer students from under-represented and
              disadvantaged background seeking entry into university level engineering,
              computer science and math based majors. The NSF scholarships possess the common
              thread to draw together four statewide academically based support environments
              serving 90% of the states under-represented technical students. The joining of
              MESA Engineering Program (MEP), California Community College Program (CCCP),
              California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) and Alliance for Minority
              Participation (AMP) provides a diverse pool of transfer-ready students who are
              extremely competent and well prepared to major in math, engineering and science
              based fields. The resources give community college transfer students the
              opportunity to demonstrate full-time commitment towards university transition
              and continuous academic enrollment. 

The statewide collaboration currently
              serves over 14,500 students pursuing engineering and science degrees in
              California institutions of higher learning. All of the participating students
              come from disadvantaged backgrounds and represent segments of our society which
              are historically underrepresented in the technical field. Approximately 90
              percent of these transfers will remain in the math-based majors. CCCTC provides
              a rigorous program of academic excellence and academic support for
              educationally disadvantaged students, especially those from groups historically
              underrepresented in math-based fields.
