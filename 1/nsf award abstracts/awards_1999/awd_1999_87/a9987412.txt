Abstract    :
              Based on the concept of Hocoka-the center of camp life, this project will
              develop a pilot-scale multimedia information database designed for distribution
              over Internet 2 formats.  Illuminating a wide array of cultural convergence on
              the Northern Plains, the pilot project will develop a database featuring five
              demonstration entries: 1) American Indian Art of Oscar Howe; 2) The Wounded
              Knee Occupation (1973); 3) Pioneer Missionaries; 4) The Impact of Mining in
              Dakota land, and 5) Sacred Practices.  Each of these entries is based upon
              visual images of museum artifacts, audio recordings from an extensive oral
              history collection, and textual material from special library collections. 
              Participating in this project are several unique cultural resources that reside
              at the University of South Dakota:  the Institute of American Indian Studies
              which houses the Oral History Center containing over 1,900 interviews of
              American Indians; the Oscar Howe Art Collection and Archives; the W. H. Over
              Museum; and the Herman P. Chilson Collection of Western Americana.  Technical
              resources brought to bear on the project include the University of South Dakota
              Internet 2 project and the Center for Instructional Design and Delivery.
