The Physics Department at The College of Wooster continues
              operating a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site
              offers student research projects in areas of current interest in experimental
              and theoretical physics.  Eight undergraduate students are recruited every year
              for a ten-week summer research experience, with a recruitment focus on students
              from predominantly undergraduate institutions.  The REU Site offers
              undergraduate students from the College of Wooster and from other institutions
              the opportunity to be involved in frontier research at an early stage of their
              scientific careers.
