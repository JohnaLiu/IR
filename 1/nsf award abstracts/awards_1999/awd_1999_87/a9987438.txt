              Applications"

Dr. Filippenko will continue a very successful
              program that discovers, performs follow-up observations with a robotic
              telescope (KAIT), and ultimately incorporates the resulting data on stellar
              supernova events into appropriate cosmological models.  Multi-color, long-term
              light curves of all sufficiently bright supernovae are being obtained.  Special
              emphasis will be placed on catching the generally neglected earliest stages of
              supernova outbursts.  The primary goal of the proposed research is to improve
              understanding of the progenitor stars, explosion mechanisms, and
              nucleosynthetic products of supernovae.  This work has contributed directly and
              measurably to the recent discovery of the accelerating universe.
