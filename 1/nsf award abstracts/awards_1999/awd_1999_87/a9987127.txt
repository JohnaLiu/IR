Abstract    :
              This project is directed at improving and enhancing the ornithological
              collections at the Burke Museum (University of Washington).  Metal cases will
              replace the last few wooden cases and drawers, archival unit trays will be used
              for small bird skins, and plastic and archival paper liners will be used to
              separate larger specimens from direct contact with wooden drawers.  The project
              will also utilize undergraduate and graduate support for all collection-based
              activities, and provide focused instruction on curatorial and conservation
              techniques.
