The PI plans to develop a flexible design and
              optimization strategy for pressure swing adsorption (PSA) systems for air
              separations.  The approach incorporates realistic, detailed process models of
              partial differential equations (PDEs) and rigorous solution procedures and
              leads to a flexible and reliable optimization environment.  The resulting
              strategy will allow for the addition and modification of adsorption isotherms
              and PDE solvers, application of new optimization algorithms, flexible
              configurations of different PSA systems, and extension to discrete and
              continuous variable optimization.  

The approach the PI plans to use will
              integrate sophisticated and efficient optimization tools based on large-scale 
              Successive Quadratic Programming (SQP)-based optimization strategies.  The work
              to be done includes:
a) model formulation of cyclic steady state processes
              that include conservation methods to track wave fronts
b) efficient
              computation of sensitivity information from the PSA model through the
              exploration of both direct and adjoint methods
c) application and refinement
              of leading edge nonlinear programming algorithms for the reliable and efficient
              optimization of large-scale systems.
The project is GOALI cooperative effort
              with Air Products and Chemicals.
