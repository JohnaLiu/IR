Abstract    :
              Using NSF funds and its own matching funds, DePaul University's School of
              Computer Science, Telecommunications and Information Systems (CTI) will create
              a new program which will increase the numbers of low income undergraduate
              students in the study of computer science. This program will award scholarships
              to students recruited through innovative outreach efforts based on
              collaboration with Information Technology industry participants. The program
              will also involve internships with Information Technology companies and
              mentoring by professionals, which along with solid curricula and financial
              support will provide a foundation for students' academic and professional
              success.
