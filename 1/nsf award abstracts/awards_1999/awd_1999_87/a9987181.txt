Abstract    :
              The Computer Science and Mathematics Scholarships (CSMS) Program at Westminster
              College improves the retention of low-income, high-achieving students seeking
              degrees in computer science and mathematics, while improving these students'
              professional development and employment opportunities. A clear benefit is
              stronger relationships between the college and corporations which employ
              graduates with computer science and mathematics degrees.

The CSMS program
              facilitates a collaboration between the College's Mathematics and Computer
              Science faculty and its Office of Financial Aid, as well as its Career Resource
              Center and advising and academic support center. The result is a team effort to
              identify, encourage, and support eligible students, provide them with academic
              and career development support to completion of baccalaureate degrees, leading
              to their placement in graduate school and/or employment. Selected students are
              full time students who expect to complete their mathematics or computer science
              degrees within the two-year program duration. They are eligible to receive a
              Pell Grant and must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher (3.2 in major
              courses).

CSMS program success will be evaluated using a number of
              parameters including pertcentage of students retained through the baccalaureate
              degree and successfully entered in graduate programs and discipline-related
              employment.
