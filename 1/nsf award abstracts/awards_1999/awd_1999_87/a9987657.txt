This grant provides funding for a series of workshops to be
              hosted jointly by the University of Minnesota and the Federal Reserve Bank of
              Minneapolis during the summers of 2000, 2001 and 2002. Each workshop will be
              one week long, concentrating on theoretical issues in macroeconomics and
              dynamic economic modeling.  These workshops continue the workshop series held
              from 1987 to 1999 at Northwestern University. Except for the change in
              location, this series is very similar to the previous one.  The topics for the
              three years vary. Areas that look promising for the 2000 workshop include:
              theoretical and computational methods for analyzing government policy in the
              absence of commitment; macroeconomic consequences of contracting frictions; and
              searching and matching models of labor market dynamics.  The topics for the
              second and third years of the workshop series will be decided at a later date.
              Areas likely to be included are: the role of financial constraints in affecting
              the entry, growth, and exit of firms; theoretical and computational methods for
              analyzing models with heterogeneous agent; political economy issues in the
              choice of aggregate policy; and the role of financial markets in business cycle
              fluctuations.
