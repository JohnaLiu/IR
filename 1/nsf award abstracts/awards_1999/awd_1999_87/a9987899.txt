Abstract    :
              This award, by the Chemistry Division, supports Dr. William T. Pennington and
              other members of the Department of Chemistry at Clemson University in
              continuing a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry.
              For the period 2000 - 2002 30 undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each
              performing original research under the supervision and guidance of Clemson
              Chemistry faculty each summer.  An eminent chemist will be invited to give the
              opening lecture for the student research symposium. Other activities in the
              program include: training in presentation of research results, training in lab
              safety, seminars, field trips and workshops on specialized topics relevant to
              the research experience. Students will be counseled on post graduate chemical
              education and their career progress will be tracked after their participation
              in the program. In the selection process preference will be given to students
              from less research-intensive institutions in the ten-state region surrounding
              Clemson and special emphasis will be placed on recruitment of students from
              groups presently underrepresented among those holding degrees in chemistry.
              Each summer program will culminate in a symposium in which students will
              present their summer's work in a poster format.
