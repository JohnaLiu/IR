Little, Richard
The Commission of engineering and Technical
              Systems (CETS), a major  unit of the National Research Council, created the
              Board on  Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment (BICE) in 1994. 
              

The BICE brings together in an independent forum expertise from a  wide
              range of scientific, engineering, and social science  disciplines to address
              problems and issues in the areas of  technology, science, and public policy
              applied to urban systems;  public facilities; infrastructure systems and
              services; above  ground and underground construction; the relationship  between
              the  constructed and natural environments and their interaction with  human
              activities; the effects of natural hazards on constructed  facilities; and
              related issues of planning, design, construction,  management, surety, and use
              of the built environment.  The BICE  provides a unique structure to respond to
              specific requests from  government, or to act on its own initiative with public
              or private  sector support.  In pursuit of its goals, BICE plans to conduct
              on-going strategic planning and oversee committee activities involving 
              studies, workshop, symposia, and a variety of information  dissemination
              activities.
