AST 9987319

A common user 1.5 THz heterodyne
              receiver system named TREND (Terahertz Receiver with Niobium Nitride Device)
              will be built and inserted into an existing dual frequency system now in use on
              AST/RO at the South Pole station.  TREND uses a hot electron bolometric (HEB)
              mixer to achieve 500K DSB low noise performance between 1,300 and 1,600
              GHz.

The detection and spatial distribution of emission from atomic and
              molecular species such as N II, H2D+ and CO will provide a new perspective on
              stellar, chemical and galactic evolution.

This will be the first
              astronomical receiver for frequencies above 1THz and will be the test bed for
              future applications of low-noise THz receivers in both airborne and space borne
              recievers.
