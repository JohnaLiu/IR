Abstract    :
              The triple photoionization of Li is studied experimentally using monochromatic
              synchrotron radiation.  The major physics to be explored concerns the high
              energy limit of single to triple photoionization where accurate theoretical
              calculations exist.  In addition, the energy sharing between three photoejected
              electrons will be explored for the first time.
