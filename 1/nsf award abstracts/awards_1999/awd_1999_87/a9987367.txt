An intensive survey effort will be undertaken to find
              and study the young low mass stars in the Orion OB1 star-forming region.  The
              survey will provide a unique foundation for several major investigations:  (1)
              timescales for star formation and cloud dispersal; (2) likelihood of triggered
              star formation by searching for sequential age groups; (3) cluster dynamics;
              and (4) identification of a statistically significant sample of stars from
              which stellar disk evolution can be studied.  The survey effort will be
              conducted at the 1-m telescope at the National Observatory in Venezuela. 
              Follow-up high-resolution spectroscopy will be performed at the 6.5-m MMT
              telescope at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona.  It is anticipated that ~40,000 variable
              stars will be identified and that a database of ~35,000 stellar spectra will be
              compiled and classified during the course of the project.
Funding for this
              project was provided by the NSF program for Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics
              (AST/SAA).
