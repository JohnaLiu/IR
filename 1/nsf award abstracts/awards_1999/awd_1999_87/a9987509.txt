Abstract    :
              This project will relocate the Museum of Southwestern Biology (University of New
              Mexico) Division of Fishes to a new facility, reorganize the collection and
              verify specimen records, check and replenish alcohol concentration, transfer
              collections from isopropanol to ethanol, and complete curation and
              computerization of the collection.  The collection comprises 2 million larval
              and adult fishes, representing the imperiled ichthyofauna of the southwestern
              US.  Collections encompass a 60 year history and provide a detailed account of
              natural and anthropogenic disturbances on fish communities on the Rio Grande
              and Colorado rivers.  Collection improvements will enhance research access to
              data, information, and collection records, and stabilize the collection in a
              larger and better storage space.
