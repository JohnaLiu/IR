              Nucleosynthesis"

Dr. Sneden is conducting a high-resolution
              spectroscopic study of selected globular cluster and field stars in the
              Galactic halo.  The primary goal is to piece together the history of early
              Galactic nucleosynthesis.  At the present time there are many models for this
              early history, and much conflicting data.  Dr. Sneden coordinates a diverse
              group of researchers working on several of the most vexing problems in stellar
              abundance analysis, such as envelope mixing, the so-called 'second parameter'
              problem for highly evolved stars on the horizontal branch, and abundance
              anomalies of lithium, thorium and iron peak elements in red giant
              stars.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Stellar
              Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
