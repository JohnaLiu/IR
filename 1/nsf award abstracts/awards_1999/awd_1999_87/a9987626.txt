              Trapido-Rosenthal/99-87626
This award provides renewed funding for a summer
              internship program at the Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR). This
              program has been active since 1991. The program brings eight undergraduate
              students to BBSR to conduct independent research projects within the framework
              of global change research. It is one of the few OCE-funded REU sites that is
              conducted during the regular academic year, bring students to BBSR for three
              months in the Fall. The students also participate in a series of lectures,
              formal and informal seminars, fieldtrips, and an oceanographic cruise. The site
              strongly recruits women and minorities.
