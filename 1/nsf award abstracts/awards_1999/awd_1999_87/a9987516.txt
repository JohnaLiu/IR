Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT
To overcome the limitations of current design verification methods for
              computer interconnect busses, this project explores application-specific
              heuristics that can significantly reduce the amount of fresh intellectual
              effort needed in verification. These heuristics are supported by a suitable
              integration of deductive and algorithmic methods. Separate application of
              deductive and algorithmic methods to verification results in either inordinate
              human effort or inadequate coverage due to ad hoc abstractions. This project
              addresses coverage by formally verifying the adequacy of abstractions using a
              deductive theorem prover. It reduces proof effort by carrying out much of the
              reasoning using automated finite-state model-checking. These ideas are explored
              in the context of bus-bridge connected I/O systems and distributed shared
              memory systems, with verified properties including transaction orderings and
              formal memory models, and with case studies drawn from commercial I/O bus
              standards and commercial shared memory systems.
