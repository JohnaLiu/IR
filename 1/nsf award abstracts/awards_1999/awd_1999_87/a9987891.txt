Abstract    :
              This project, which is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program
              uses Frontal Analysis Continuous Capillary Chromatography (FACCE) to
              characterize the binding of proteins to polyelectrolytes.  Conducted by Dr.
              Paul L. Dubin and his group at Indiana University-Purdue University at
              Indianapolis, the project extends the range of FACCE to include proteins at or
              below their pIs. The range is extended by modifying the capillary used in FACCE
              via physisorption of cationic-nonionic block copolymers on the capillary walls.
               Binding isotherms and hence binding constants (Kb) are obtained for
              polyanion-protein pairs of biological interest.  Particular emphasis is placed
              on glycosaminoglycans, especially hyaluronic acid and heparin.  FACCE studies
              will also be carried out with couples such as heparin and serum albumin to
              elucidate the role of overall macromolecular structural parameters such as
              polymer charge density and chain stiffness.  Computational modeling of protein
              electrostatics helps rationalize the effects of key variables such as ionic
              strength and pH on Kb values obtained via FACCE.

This research uses Frontal
              Analysis Continuous Capillary Chromatography (FACCE) and protein electrostatics
              to characterize the binding of proteins to polyelectrolytes. The information
              developed will increase the understanding of the role of such binding in
              intercellular signaling and cell development in living organisms.
