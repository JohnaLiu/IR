Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports continuation of a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates site at the University of Rochester. The project is being
              directed by Drs. Thomas Krugh and William Jones and over the period 2000 - 2002
              will support 30 undergraduate students and 15 high school teachers in 8 - 10
              weeks each of full time research as a member of an established research team.
              Each participant will be assigned a specific research problem and a graduate
              student or postdoctoral mentor to provide day-to-day advice. Participants will
              meet weekly with colleagues to discuss their research and to analyze ethical
              issues in science. Mini courses on contemporary research in chemistry and its
              applications, careers in science and post-graduate science education will
              complement the research program. Participants will be required to present their
              results orally and in writing to develop their communications skills.
