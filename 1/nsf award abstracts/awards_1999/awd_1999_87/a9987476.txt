Abstract    :
              Giacinto Scoles of Princeton University is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study chemical dynamics in isolated
              molecules and clusters.  These are to be performed using his recently
              developed: (1) Helium Nano Droplet Isolation (HENDI) Spectrometer with infrared
              (IR) molecular excitation and relaxation as well as microwave (MW) and MW-MW
              double resonance spectroscopy and (2) IR-IR double resonance spectrometer. 
              Specifically, these devices will be used to (1) obtain the microwave spectra of
              the molecular pairs (hydrogenated and deuterated monofluoromethane, hydrogen
              chloride and hydrogen bromide), (2) study the spectroscopy of the
              molecule/radical complexes (acetylene and oxygen molecules with oxygen atoms,
              oxygen molecules with the cyanide radical and detailed studies of the cyanide
              radical itself)  and (3) study the dynamics of isolated molecules involving
              intramolecular vibrational relaxation (initially in diacetylene and
              cyanoacetylene), and  isomerization between methyl cyanide and isocyanide and
              between cyclopropane and propene.

This study uses new experimental
              techniques to probe energy transfer processes and reactions of molecules and
              molecular clusters in both isolated molecules and molecules embedded in liquid
              helium nanoparticles.  It has enabled high resolution infrared and microwave
              spectra to be obtained in the liquid phase to uncover the fundamental
              mechanisms of these energy transfer and reactive processes.
