Abstract    :
              This project will provide forty $2,500 scholarships for students majoring in
              Computer Science, Information Science, and Engineering Technology. The emphasis
              in this initiative will be to recruit transfer students from the community
              colleges in Arkansas who have completed an associate's degree or who are very
              near completion. 

A new College of Information Science and Systems
              Engineering, recently established, will provide a strong recruiting and student
              support structure. Recruiting activities will be coordinated by the Assistant
              Dean for Recruitment and Minority Affairs and will include visiting the
              community colleges, developing print materials concerning the program and
              advertising in the school papers. 

The project will develop a strong support
              structure for these students that will include faculty and industry mentoring,
              orientation, a "Learning Community" using linked courses, and other activities
              aimed at retention and graduation. 

There is a great deal of support from
              industry and from the community colleges for this program as indicated by the
              support letters in the appendix.
