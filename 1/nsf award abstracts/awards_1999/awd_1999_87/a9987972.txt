Abstract    :
              This work considers a hybrid motion planning/control problem termed controlled
              and constrained coverage -- i.e. the precise regulation of a mechanism's work
              space effects through planning, sensor observations, and long-term process
              monitoring to achieve the controlled execution of area-covering tasks.  Typical
              work space effects include the sensitivity pattern of a detector used for
              search tasks, the reach of a lawn mower's cutting tool, but paint application
              in the automotive industry motivates this effort. The two basic intellectual
              foci of this work are understanding how coverage tasks can be accomplished
              while ensuring the precise control of process variables and the development of
              coverage path planning tools which will make it possible to adjust process
              variables necessitating complete replanning.  These results will enable paint
              application
specialists (or anyone involved in surface coating/inspection
              tasks) to efficiently program trajectories that satisfy performance constraints
              while reducing cycle time, and improving efficiency. The Principle
              Investigators will be working closely with researchers within Ford, including
              members of Ford's Scientific Research Labs, their Advanced Manufacturing
              Technology division, and Global Paint Engineering, to ensure practical utility
              and applicability of the research.
