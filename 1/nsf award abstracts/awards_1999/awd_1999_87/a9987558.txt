This project will supply shipboard scientific
              support equipment for the research vessel Longhorn operated by the University
              of Texas Austin and dedicated to use in support of ocean science research.  The
              Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship
              equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science
              research. This Program provides support for such items as deck equipment
              including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
              instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
              satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
              equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
              scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
              for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.  The Project
              Director, Anthony Amos is fully qualified to direct this project having had
              considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
              shipboard equipment.  This project will allow the institution to acquire a
              Weather Fax Receiver and a Differential GPS.
