Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Drs. Barbara Schowen,
              Cynthia Larive and other members of the Chemistry Department at the University
              of Kansas in continuing a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in
              chemistry. For the period 2000-2002 30 undergraduate students will spend ten
              weeks each conducting summer research under the supervision of Chemistry
              faculty. Participants will choose among projects in analytical,  inorganic,
              organic, physical, theoretical and biochemical areas. Faculty and graduate
              student mentors will help undergraduate participants develop as mature and
              confident researchers. In addition to laboratory research there will be short
              tutorials, weekly seminars and presentations of interim and final project
              results both orally and in poster format. There will be extensive tracking and
              follow-up of participants.
