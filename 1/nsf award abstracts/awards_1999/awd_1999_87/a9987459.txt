Abstract    :
              	The 1992-96 election cycle saw several remarkable developments:  in 1992, Ross
              Perot received the second largest third-party vote since the Civil War; in
              1994, the Republicans won majorities of the House and Senate for the first time
              in forty years; and in 1996, the Reform Party emerged as the institutional
              extension of the Perot movement.  In his second run, Perot's vote declined to
              just over eight percent, but he still managed to become the first third-party
              candidate to win more than five percent in two successive presidential
              elections since the formation of the Republican Party.
	Based on work
              completed from our research on these elections, we conclude that these
              remarkable events are closely related.  Perot's 1992 constituency presented the
              major parties with a nearly irresistible target of opportunity, which the
              Republicans were able to capitalize on much more successfully than were the
              Decemorats, especially in 1994.  By articulating and testing a theory of
              third-party support and linking it to major-party change, we have developed
              micro-behavioral evidence to explain how a third-party movement, such as that
              of Perot, can bring about major-party change.
	Briefly, the theory posits a
              positive, or "pull," component that results from attraction to the third-party
              candidate, and a negative, or "push," component that reacts against the
              major-party alternatives to explain third-party activist support.  In a variety
              of tests, we find strong evidence that potential activists were motivated by
              both push and pull factors in 1992 and 1996.  For example, on the issues, Perot
              attracted support because of issue proximity to him, and from activists who
              felt that the Reform Party shared their most important policy priorities.  At
              the same time, supporters were activated for Perot by their conviction that the
              best major-party alternative was remote from their interests, by the lack of
              choice between the Democratic and Republican candidates on the issues, and by
              the perception that the major parties did not share their issue
              priorities.
	This model of support serves as a basis for understanding the
              decline in support for Perot between 1992 and 1996.  In addition, we draw on
              our work on nomination candidacies in the major parties to show that carryover
              and spillover effects linked to mobilization by Perot in 1992 can help to
              explain movement by supporters into the Republican Party in 1994 and 1996.
	We
              seek support to continue our work on the Reform Party through the 2000
              election.  The design calls for continuing our 1992-94-96 panel of potential
              Perot activists through the 2000 election.  We also have two fresh Reform
              samples that began in 1996 and that we use as the basis of a new panel in 2000:
               a national sample of Reform contributors, and a national sample of
              participants in the Perot-Lamm "primary by mail" conducted by the Party in
              August, 1996.  In 1996, we also conducted surveys of DNC and RNC contributors
              that give us directly comparable national samples to the Reform contributor
              survey.  We panel back to both of the Reform samples and the two major-party
              samples immediately after the 2000 election.
	These data collections give us
              unprecedented access to an historic third-party movement at a critical point
              when it faces the first election following Perot's hegemony over the Party.  By
              extending the study, we are able to examine the development and
              institutionalization of the Reform Party, or its decline and demise.  In any
              event, we can study the involvement of 1996 Reform supporters in subsequent
              major-party campaigns, and the effect of the Reform Party on the two major
              parties.
