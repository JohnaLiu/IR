Abstract    :
              The Computer Science and Engineering Students Ahead Initiative, a partnership
              between the Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute (TVI), New Mexico's
              largest community college, and New Mexico Tech, a state-supported research
              institution in Socorro, New Mexico, will increase the number of New Mexicans
              entering engineering and computer science-related careers with associate and
              bachelor degrees. The Initiative will award scholarships to twenty low-income
              TVI students to complete two-year degrees and ten transfer scholarships to NM
              Tech. The Initiative provides financial support, enrichment activities, and
              peer tutors -- all proven retention and success strategies, particularly for
              minority students. Last year, 100% of TVI's graduates in computing and
              engineering technology were placed in employment or a four-year university.
              TVI, a Hispanic-Serving Institution, ranks nationally as a community college
              leader in graduating Hispanics; and, with 950 Native American students, it is
              larger than many Indian colleges. NM Tech, a state-supported research
              institution in science and engineering, has 1,400 students and is located 75
              miles from Albuquerque. The CSE Students Ahead project will stimulate students
              to transfer to NM Tech for the high-quality research experience while retaining
              the intimacy of a small college and proximity to home and will place others in
              jobs. The project's two paths- associate and bachelor degree/employment and
              transfer-will move New Mexico's low-income students ahead.
