This award to University of Delaware will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Cape Henlopen, a
              research vessel operated by the university as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes an undulating, towed sensor package for physical, chemical
              and biological studies, which will replace a similar system lost in 1999; in
              addition, they will acquire a system for monitoring cable out and tension on
              four winches, as well as a counterbalanced block to assist over-side
              deployments and a video distribution system for shipboard data.  The shared-use
              instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies,
              particularly in  the western North Atlantic Ocean, during 2000 and future
              years.
