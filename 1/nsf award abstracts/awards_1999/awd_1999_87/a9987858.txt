Abstract    :
              Information-based complexity (IBC) studies the complexity of solving problems
              for which only partial information is available.  Many problems that IBC has
              successfully handled have been linear, i.e., the solution depends linearly on
              the input.  However, many seemingly-linear problems have hidden nonlinearities.
               The Investigator proposes to study two such problems.  The first is
              integration, which has several important nonlinear variants (such as Stieltjes
              and surface integrals); moreover, the integral depends nonlinearly on the
              domain of integration.  The second is linear elliptic partial differential
              equations, for which there is a nonlinear dependence on the domain of
              definition and on the coefficients of the linear partial differential operator.
               Our goals include: determining the problem complexity, finding (nearly-)
              optimal algorithms), and determining whether adaptive information is better
              than nonadaptive information.
