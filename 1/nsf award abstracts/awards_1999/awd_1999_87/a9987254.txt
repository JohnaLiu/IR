Abstract    :
              Pasadena City College (PCC) is establishing a Computer Science, Engineering, and
              Mathematics (CSEM) Scholarship Program. Forty talented and economically
              disadvantaged students are chosen as scholars each year. Individual counseling,
              career guidance and faculty mentoring are provided to the scholars. Scholars
              also experience activities such as field trips to nearby colleges and research
              institutes like Caltech and JPL, seminar talks by professionals in CSEMS
              fields, and workshops on topics relevant to college life and the transfer
              process.
