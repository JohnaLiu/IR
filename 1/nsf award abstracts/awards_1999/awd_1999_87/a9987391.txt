Dappen, Werner
The PI proposes to develop a unified equation of
              state for stellar interior computations.  Such models are the foundation of
              stellar astronomy, and they provide the basis for understanding the structure
              of normal stars, as well as models for later stages of stellar evolution.  The
              main goal of the project is to reconcile inconsistencies that currently exist
              between two competing approaches to determining the interior structure of the
              Sun.  The PIs will use direct comparisons between the their interior models and
              GONG solar oscillation data.  This should provide firm tests of the derived the
              equation of state, at least in low density regions.  The results may help
              improve the determination of the Sun's helium abundance, a value that has
              substantial impact on stellar models in general and on the cosmological origins
              of helium.  They also have the potential to improve model calculations for
              other stellar evolutionary stages, such as low density giant stars to high
              density white dwarf stars.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF
              program for Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
