"Spectroscopic Analysis of Objects with
              non-Spherical Envelopes"
AST-9987390

In this project a non-equilibrium
              multi-dimensional program will be created to model the spectra of astrophysical
              objects with non-spherical geometry, such as Be stars, T Tauri stars,
              Wolf-Rayet stars, binary stars, novae, supernovae and quasars.  The code
              developed in this project will provide an important diagnostic tool to analyze
              the data collected with ground- and space-based telescopes at non-optical
              wavelengths.  Such multi-wavelength observations are essential to sample
              different physical regions of stellar envelopes from which the geometry and
              structure can be reconstructed.  Initial work will concentrate on the
              development of general models with axial symmetry, outflow and rotation of
              circumstellar material.  The effects of polarization and more complicated
              geometry will be incorporated in the later stages of the project.
