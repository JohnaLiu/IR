This is a summer program, which will allow undergraduates
              the opportunity to participate in the excitement of working in a premier
              high-pressure mineral physics laboratory.  The goal of the program is to
              recruit students from the physical sciences with the hope that they will be
              stimulated to the point of pursuing a research career in the Earth Sciences. 
              Students in this program will work with faculty members of the Mineral Physics
              Institute on projects, which probe the physical and chemical properties of
              materials with a particular emphasis on the use of high pressure.  Working
              closely with members of the MPI, students will pursue their own projects and
              discuss their progress during weekly seminar sessions.  During the program,
              students will visit other laboratories and institutions affiliated with the
              Mineral Physics Institute.
