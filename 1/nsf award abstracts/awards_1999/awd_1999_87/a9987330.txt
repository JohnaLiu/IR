Niobium based superconducting receivers offer the
              highest sensitivity for millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.  The
              development of high quality, low noise mixer elements for these superconducting
              receivers is essential.  The general radio astronomy community and the Atacama
              Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) directly benefit from this work.

The work is
              divided into 2 parts: SIS mixers and HEB mixers.

For the SIS mixers will be
              investigated in 4 stages: 1) a prototype 50ohm/square (4.2 degrees Kelvin) NbOx
              resister technology for image rejection mixers will be further developed using
              a new deposition system.  2) on-waver modules to control junction specific
              capacitance, dielectric constant and penetration depth 3) smaller junction
              areas for higher frequencies, 4) post wafer processing including whole wafer
              thinning (<2mil).

HEB (super conducting hot electron bolometer) mixers
              research will be continued investigating: high bandwidth performance,
              applications of focussed ion beam to the fabrication of novel diffusion cooled
              hot electron bolometric mixers and other innovative Nb mixer fabrication
              processes.
