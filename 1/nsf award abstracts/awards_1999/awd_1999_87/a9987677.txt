The understanding of the response of geomaterials such as
              soils and rocks is crucial in addressing a variety of problems in geotechnical
              engineering, environmental engineering, transportation, building and
              construction technology.  Attempts to describe the response of such materials
              are adaptations of classical plasticity and mixture theory.  Recently, a
              general framework has been developed to study a diverse class of dissipative
              processes such as slip, twinning, phase transition, and damage in polymer
              networks.  The objective of this award is to generalize the theory further to
              include the dissipative response of geomaterials.

The main features of the
              theory are: it takes into account the fact that many materials can exist in
              more than one natural configuration and that, at a given instant, the response
              is determined by the deformation gradient from all these configurations, giving
              the material its mixture-like characteristics; when these materials undergo
              dissipative processes, the underlying natural configurations invariably change;
              the evolution of the natural configurations is determined in general by a
              thermodynamic criterion; the material has various means of storing energy;
              different types of response can be activated if certain thermodynamic criteria
              are met; and once a particular mechanism is activated, it might be necessary to
              prescribe the evolution for the mechanism.
