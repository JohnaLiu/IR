Abstract    :
              This award by the Chemistry Division supports Dr. Judith Eglin and other members
              of the Chemistry Department at Mississippi State University in continuing a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period
              2000-2002 30 undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each conducting summer
              research under the supervision of Chemistry faculty. These students will have
              the opportunity of working with state of the art equipment in newly renovated
              laboratories. At least eight of the participants will be from smaller schools
              without access to such facilities. Recruitment will focus on schools in
              Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana and on attracting women
              and minorities as participants. Each student will present a seminar on her/his
              summer project, learn how to create a scientific poster paper and write a
              research report on the project. Dr. Eglin and Dr. Keith Mead, also of the
              Mississippi State Chemistry Department will meet weekly with all participating
              students to discuss their experiences as well as topics of special importance
              in scientific training such as ethics and opportunities and application for
              postgraduate degree study in chemistry.
