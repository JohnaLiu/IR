Abstract    :
              This project will convert the University of Minnesota Herbarium to a
              movable-aisle storage system.  The herbarium is over a century old, and is one
              of the larger herbaria in the country, ranking 13th nationally and 6th among
              university herbaria.  Accessions number over 800,000 specimens and represent
              most familial groups and much of the earth's biomes.  The project will focus on
              the cryptogamic and non-seed plants (about 1/3 of the total collection), and
              will provide a movable-aisle compactor system to generate additional floor
              space, replacement cabinets for current oversized ones, and additional cabinets
              to alleviate overcrowding and accommodate growth for the next 20 years.  The
              improved collections will make it easier for researchers to access the
              collection, and receive loans of materials.
