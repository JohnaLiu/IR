Abstract    :
              This project in laser-molecule interactions utilizes a femtosecond laser system
              to probe the behavior of molecules in strong laser fields.  The work will
              attempt to disentangle various effects that influence this behavior, such as
              bond softening, light-induced bound states, enhanced ionization by electron
              localization, charge-asymmetric dissociation, and rescattering.  Measurements
              will employ a new technique called correlated ion spectroscopy.
