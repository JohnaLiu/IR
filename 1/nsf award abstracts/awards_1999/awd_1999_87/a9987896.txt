A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site
              will be established at the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy.    
              The students selected for the program will work closely with a faculty mentor
              on cutting-edge projects in such fields as solar physics, planetary astronomy,
              stellar astrophysics, the interstellar medium and star formation, normal and
              active galaxies, cosmology, and instrumentation development.  Each student will
              participate in at least one observing run related to his or her project. The
              program will be student-centered and will have many supplemental activities
              such as seminars, journal clubs, and discussion groups. These activities will
              be designed to allow students to learn about front-line research from the
              scientists that are doing it, and to develop their skills in discussing their
              research projects with their peers. At the end of the summer program,
              participants will create poster and verbal presentations describing their
              research projects. Each year the two students whose projects are judged to be
              best by a panel of faculty will receive support to attend a national scientific
              meeting to present their results.  The students will meet biweekly with the
              principal and co-principal investigators to review the progress on the
              projects.  An external evaluator will work with the project team in assessing
              the impact of the program. The evaluator will meet with the students over a
              period of 3 days, both at the beginning and end of the summer. Post-program
              tracking of the participants will be undertaken to assess the long-term impact
              of the summer research experience on the participants' scientific
              careers.

This project is funded by the Division of Astronomical
              Science.
