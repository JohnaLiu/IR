              ABSTRACT

OCE-9987501

While it has been shown that the addition of Fe can
              stimulate phytoplankton growth and alter upper ocean biogeochemistry, little is
              know about the net effect of Fe availability on sinking particle fluxes.  If Fe
              played an important role in past variations in CO2 or if there will be long
              term effects of Fe on CO2 due to deliberate manipulation of ocean ecosystems,
              then it becomes essential to quantify the net change in export fluxes of carbon
              and associated elements in response to Fe loading.  For this reason, the PI
              will quantify changes in particulate organic carbon and particulate organic
              nitrogen export during the Southern Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX) using the
              naturally occurring radionuclide thorium-234.  Using time-series profiles of
              234Th obtained both inside and outside of the SOFeX study area, the PI will be
              able to study the export response to changes in Fe loading and community
              structure, as well as assist in the calculation of the carbon and nutrient
              fluxes in response to the Fe additions.   Information on the export response of
              the upper ocean to Fe enrichment will be used to understand past oceanic
              responses to Fe/dust inputs and assess future impacts of deliberate Fe
              fertilization proposed to offset carbon dioxide emissions.
