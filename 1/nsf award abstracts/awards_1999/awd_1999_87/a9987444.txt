Abstract    :
              This project is a partnership of the Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance
              (MMSA) and the three largest campuses in the University of Maine System: the
              Univ. of Maine - Orono, the Univ. of Maine - Farmington, and the Univ. of
              Southern Maine, which collectively produce over 80% of the certified teachers
              in the State each year. These partners are collaborating to increase the number
              of qualified mathematics and science teachers graduating from the different
              campuses; to increase the retention of teachers in their first three years by
              building "cross-tier" support groups of university faculty, practicing
              teachers, and students; and to improve the quality of mathematics and science
              education for prospective teachers at the three campuses through active
              interactions among faculty from Arts and Sciences, faculty from Education, and
              grade K-12 teachers. The project is motivated by the need: 1) to reverse the
              decline in numbers of qualified K-12 mathematics and science teachers that is
              currently projected to occur over the next decade in Maine, and 2) to address
              the fact that one third of Maine's current mathematics and science teachers
              teach "out of area".
