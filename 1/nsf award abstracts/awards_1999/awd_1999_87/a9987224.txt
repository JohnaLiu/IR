Abstract    :
              A CSEMS scholarship program is established for the purpose of improving the
              education of students in Mathematics and Computer Science and a dual-degree
              engineering program, improve their retention, improve professional development,
              and strengthen partnerships with the employment sector. The goals are
              accomplished by establishing a mentor program and by allowing students to
              devote more time to their educational pursuits in a well - structured program
              as opposed to working on non-discipline jobs to support their educational
              expenses. Students participate in a mentoring program, field trips, tutoring,
              research, and other project activities specifically designed to increase their
              productivity. Expected outcomes are improved retention, increased GPA's for
              participants, and better preparedness for the job market or graduate school.
