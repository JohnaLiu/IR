Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31), Mathematical Sciences (21), Computer Engineering (32),
              Engineering Technology (58) This Computer Science, Engineering, and
              Mathematics, Scholarship (CSEMS) Program is providing scholarships and an
              infrastructure that will enable academically talented, financially
              disadvantaged students to maintain full-time enrollment and achieve degree
              completion in the fields of engineering, engineering technology, mathematics,
              computer science, and computer technology. As the project administrator, the
              university's existing SUMS Institute is coordinating efforts between the
              Department of Mathematics and the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences
              to: 1) recruit and select program students; 2) provide activities designed to
              support the students through degree achievement; and 3) prepare the students
              for future employment and/or higher education. The project expects to increase
              the enrollment and the graduation of students in science, engineering,
              mathematics, and other technical fields from groups that have traditionally
              been underrepresented. The CSEMS Program is expanding and enhancing the
              continuum of services available to students of diverse gender, ethnic, social,
              and economic backgrounds, and is evidence of the university's commitment to
              providing a high quality education for all students.
