Abstract    :
              This project will computerize the holdings of the Angelo State Natural History
              Collections and the dissemination of that catalog information on the web.  A
              computerized database of catalog records for the herbarium (40,000 specimens),
              mammal collection (10,500) specimens), amphibian and reptile collection (13,000
              specimens), and the bird collection (2,000 specimens) will be created in a
              fully-searchable database.  The main emphasis of these collections are the most
              complete systematic collections of vascular plants and terrestrial vertebrates
              of West-Central Texas.
