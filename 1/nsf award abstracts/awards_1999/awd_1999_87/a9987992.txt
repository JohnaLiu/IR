The Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site at the
              Center for Ultrafast Optical Science (CUOS) involves 6 students for a 10-week
              summer program each year.  The students are recruited from all over the country
              to conduct reserch with faculty and research scientists at the Center.  The
              research projects involve applying the unique capabilities of intense,
              ultrashort laser pulses to problems in engineering, physics, chemistry,
              materials science, biology, and medicine.  The students receive initial
              training in laser safety and machine shop techniques.  They meet regularly with
              their research mentors and the PI to discuss research porgress and such matters
              as ethics and the process of applying to graduate school.  A number of social
              activities are planned, which include picnics and a trip to the Greenfield
              village Museum in Dearborn.  At the end of the program the students present
              their research results in a seminar as well as in a written report.  The REU
              scholars are paid a stipend of $3300 and are provided a housing allowance as
              well as a reasonable amount for travel expenses.
