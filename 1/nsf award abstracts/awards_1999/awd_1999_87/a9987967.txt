Abstract    :
              This is an award for a REU Site.  Ten to twelve undergraduate students are
              competitively selected to spend three summer months at the Space Physics
              Research Laboratory, University of Michigan, where each works with one of the
              about 30 faculty members doing research in Airglow and Atmospheric Science
              Space Plasma Physics, Cometary Studies, Planetary Atmospheres, Air Pollution
              Transport, and Lidars.  In this research the students have opportunities to
              interact with their mentors, other undergraduate students in the program,
              graduate students at the university and other faculty members.  They are able
              to have hands on experience working with instrumentation which has or will fly
              in space, is making remote sensing measurements of the atmosphere, and
              fabricate and calibrate components of these state of the art systems.  They are
              also able to choose to construct and work with software packages which solve
              analytical expressions, present space flight data in image forms, and
              manipulate large data bases.  A portion of their experience involves attending
              weekly seminars given by the SPRL faculty staff, writing up their work in a
              report for their mentor (which may be publishable), and presenting their report
              orally to the students and staff.
