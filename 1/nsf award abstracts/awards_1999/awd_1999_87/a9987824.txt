Abstract    :
              This award, by the Chemistry Division, supports Dr. Rebecca Braslau and other
              members of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California Santa
              Cruz in continuing a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in
              chemistry. For the period 2000 - 2002, 36 undergraduate students will spend ten
              weeks each performing original research under the supervision and guidance of
              Chemistry faculty each summer. The program will introduce student participants
              to the use of the library in addition to laboratory research and will train
              them in both written and oral communication of research results. The program
              will be integrated with the University's ACCESS program which brings 18 local
              underrepresented minority college students to campus for a summer research
              experience. Participants in the two programs will attend joint evening research
              seminars and workshops on graduate school selection and application.  The long
              range impact of the program will be to provide the participants with a
              realistic understanding of scientific research that will be crucial to their
              post graduate professional success.
