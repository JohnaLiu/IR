Abstract    :
              This award in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program provides
              continued support for a site at the University of Miami (Ohio).  The site will
              be directed by Drs. Michael W. Crowder and Christopher A. Makaroff.  Research
              opportunities will be provided for 10 students each summer in areas of
              analytical and organic chemistry and biochemistry.  All of the students will be
              from institutions other than Miami University.  The core of the experience will
              be an independent research project and will begin with a presentation by each
              student of the plans for the summer's work developed through consultation with
              a faculty member.  Stress will be placed on experimental design and
              inquiry-based thinking.  Close student-mentor interactions and weekly group and
              discussion meetings will guide student progress.  In addition to the 10-week
              research experience, programs in career counseling, ethics, a weekly research
              meeting, and oral and written communication will be offered.  Students will
              present their work in a research symposium.  Effort will be made to include
              students from groups that are underrepresented in chemistry.
