Abstract    :
              POSAKONY
The availability of complete genomic sequence data for many organisms
              will greatly accelerate unraveling the transcriptional regulatory network
              underlying their development.  However, this effort, what might be termed
              "developmental genomics", is currently seriously hampered by the lack of
              systematic determinations of the DNA-binding specificities of most
              transcription factors.  The project seeks to address this deficiency, and will
              consist of three principal phases:

(1) Express in, and purify from, bacteria
              a selected set of transcription factor fusion proteins.
(2) Determine the
              DNA-binding specificity of each protein by an affinity chromatography random
              oligonucleotide selection method.
(3) Analyze and post binding site data on
              suitable Web sites (e.g., TRANSFAC) in the form of position weight matrices;
              make fusion protein plasmids freely available.

Only part of the scientific
              and public benefit of having complete DNA sequences for various organisms,
              including both humans and animal models such as mice and fruit flies, will
              derive from knowing all of the proteins these species can make.  It will also
              be extremely valuable to identify and study the regulatory sequences associated
              with each gene that control the times and tissues in which each protein is
              produced.  This research will contribute strongly to this effort, by
              determining the specific DNA sites at which key regulatory proteins interact
              with the genes they control.
