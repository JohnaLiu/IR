Abstract    :
              The goals of this proposed study are to:
- Increase the understanding of the
              role of evaluation in SI
- Examine the feasibility of using existing data sets
              to draw conclusions about SI effectiveness
- Develop and test an impact model
              that can be used to assess the efficacy of systemic initiatives
- Devise
              recommendations to help guide NSF and others on data collection and analysis to
              assess the impact of educational reforms on student achievement.

Through
              this study,  a greater understanding to educators, policymakers, and
              researchers will be provided about the impact of systemic initiatives on
              student achievement, how they have been evaluated in the past, and how they
              might be evaluated in the future.
