This award to University of California Santa Barbara will
              support the development and fabrication of a new surface buoy to support the
              Bermuda Testbed Mooring, a deep ocean facility open to academic researchers
              throughout the US for testing oceanographic instrumentation and maintaining
              time-series measurements of physical, chemical and biological properties in the
              Sargasso Sea region near Bermuda.  The new design will improve handling and
              safety in deployment and recovery of the mooring, as well as expand
              capabilities for instrument deployments.  It is anticipated that the new design
              will be applicable for use on similar moorings in other environments, and that
              the design development here will help improve capabilities for other research
              moorings in the future.
