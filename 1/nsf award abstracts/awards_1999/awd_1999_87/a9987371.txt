Abstract    :
              The fungi from the Tulane University herbarium were donated to the New York
              Botanical Garden in June, 1999, and comprised approximately 10,000 specimens. 
              This fungal collection has een consulted by most of the specialists in
              aphyllophoroid fungi who have worked during the past 40 years.  The specimens
              are well-preserved and free of insect or other damage.  This collection is not
              duplicated elsewhere, and is unique.  Funds will be used to incorporate and
              integrate them into the NYBG fungus herbarium by interfiling them with existing
              collections, which will necessitate  repairing specimens, updating
              nomenclature, and databasing all specimens into the institutional database.
