Abstract    :
              In the proposed initiative, the university will recruit Millennium Scholars, and
              retain them through to the degree through mentoring, academic support, and
              industry internships, and will assist them with employment placement through
              new and established links to the corporate sector. The pool of students to be
              selected for this program is identified as economically disadvantaged students
              with an emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities [African American,
              Hispanic, Native American]. The students will be drawn from the upper division
              [junior and senior classes], and possibly MS candidates in the target areas:
              Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical
              Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Civil Engineering.
