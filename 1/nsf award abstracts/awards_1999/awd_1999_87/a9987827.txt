Abstract    :
              This award partially supports the acquisition of a basic instrumentation package
              and other essential equipment for the University of California San Diego (UCSD)
              geotechnical centrifuge.  In order to accommodate the research and educational
              capabilities of this centrifuge, the Geomechanics Laboratory at UCSD is being
              renovated.  Upon completion of the proposed work, the centrifuge will be
              capable of conducting instrumented experiments for both educational and 
              research purposes.  Educational applications will receive major attention with
              intended far-reaching accessibility via the Internet.  Undergraduate and
              graduate UCSD students are already participating in this development phase
              (http://webshaker.ucsd.edu ).  Near-term research objectives include use of an
              electric-motor actuator system to conduct above-ground cyclic loading tests on
              shallow and deep foundations.  This system will be the backbone of seismic
              performance-based design research in the broad area of soil-structure
              interaction.  Additional long-term plans include the development of robotics
              capabilities in order to broaden the variety of educational and research
              applications.  Such robotics applications include in-flight simulation of
              Cast-In-Drilled-Hole (CIDH) pile construction, as well as other
              ground/foundation modification/retrofitting techniques
