	Large-Scale Nonlinear Programming
	
Large nonlinear optimization problems
              arise in many important
areas of application such as climate modeling, weather
              forecasting,
network design, and finance. An important open problem is how
              to
solve these problems reliably and quickly. The proposal describes a
              
variety of new algorithms, based on barrier techniques, that promise
to be
              effective on problems of unprecedented size and complexity.
To ensure that the
              new methods are robust even in the case of high
ill-conditioning, novel
              regularization techniques are proposed. An
Internet-based solver implementing
              the new algorithms will be
developed as part of this project. It will allow
              the engineering
and scientific communities to solve large optimization
              problems
automatically using a web-based interface.
