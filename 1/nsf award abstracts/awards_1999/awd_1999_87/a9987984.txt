Abstract    :
              This project consists of several experiments designed to measure atomic
              transition matrix elements important to the interpretation of atomic parity
              non-conservation (PNC) experiments.  This interpretation requires accurate
              knowledge of atomic structure and places stringent requirements on the accuracy
              of atomic structure calculations.  These new experiments, which will measure
              absolute transition strengths to high precision, should be able to determine
              the value of transition matrix elements accurate to 0.3%, thereby testing
              theoretical calculations below the current known level of 1%.  While the
              present measurements will focus on cesium, the techniques can be extended to
              other atoms of interest for testing the standard model and atomic theory.
