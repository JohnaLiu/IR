Abstract    :
              The Herbarium at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) serves as an
              important source of plant information for the regional community.  It is
              engaged in numerous research projects, including institutional, governmental,
              and outside private work.  Though the collection is rapidly growing, its full
              potential as a biological information source is not being realized because of
              the incompleteness of its collection database system as well as the
              collection's late beginnings and lack of community awareness.  The goals of the
              project are entry of all specimen data, opening access by a fully-searchable
              web-accessible database, and expansion of the data exchange capacity with
              researchers.  Support will enable staff and material resources to achieve these
              objectives.
