Abstract    :
              The project is to rehouse the University Museum, University of Arkansas,
              zoological fluid specimens in closed cabinets in the new University of Arkansas
              Colletions Facility.  The colletions are currently housed on open shelving in
              the University's former library building.  The collections represent the
              second-largest fluid specimen collection of fishes, reptiles, and amphibians in
              the state of Arkansas.  The collection is significant for the numbers of
              endemic species representative of the unique montane topography of Arkansas. 
              The collection is used by researchers, government scientists, and as exhibits
              for specialized instruction.  The collection record data is computerized and in
              conjunction with the improved storage conditions, it should continue to
              represent an important regional resource for freshwater organisms.
