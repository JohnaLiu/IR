Abstract    :
              The Paleobotany collection of the Peabody Museum of Natural History (Yale
              University) is one of the largest and most historically important in the United
              States. WIth over 150,000 specimens, it comprises four separate units: the
              original Yale Collection, the New York Botanical Garden Collection, the
              Princeton Colletion, and the more recent field collections of Peabody curators
              and students.  This project will focus efforts on the reorganization,
              compactorization, and completion of the electronic cataloguing of the
              Paleobotany Collection in Yale University's new Environmental Science Facility,
              currently under construction.  Purchase of a compactor system and of a standard
              size of cabinetry, both conforming to the collections equipment standard of the
              ESF, will optimize space, and the move will allow a unique opportunity to
              reorganize and integrate the four collection units.  Specimen data that have
              not yet been electronically catalogued will be entered into the Peabody's
              museum-wide relational database system, Argus, and will be available over the
              Peabody Museum website.
