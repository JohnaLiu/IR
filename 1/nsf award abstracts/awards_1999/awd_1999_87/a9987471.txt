Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              continues support for research on the synthesis of complex metal oxides by Dr.
              Jon Zubieta of the Chemistry Department, Syracuse  University. Organic ligands
              introduced during hydrothermal preparations to form unusual solids of three
              general types: microporous solids with zeolite scale cavities; two dimensional
              networks linked by organic tethers, and V/O or Mo/O inorganic skeletons
              incorporating secondary coordination complexes. These open-framework and
              layered structures will be prepared by low-temperature methods that will permit
              the isolation of kinetically stable phases. The long-term goal of this research
              is the 'design' of one, two, and three dimensional coordination complexes that
              will provide a scaffold to entrain oxide substructures. 

Metal oxide based
              solid phase compounds are important in catalysis, sorption, molecular
              electronics, energy storage, optical materials, and ceramics. Variations in
              chemical composition and structure effect a wide  range of properties. New
              synthetic approaches to introducing organic groups are expected to result in
              compounds with an expanded range of properties by compensating charge,
              directing structural growth, or connecting functional groups.
