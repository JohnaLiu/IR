Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this project is to enhance the existing research and
              educational infrastructure to prepare academically talented students from
              low-income and disadvantaged families for degree achievement in higher
              education. A well-structured, proactive, and collaborative infrastructure with
              committed partnerships from industry, government, and academic institutions is
              now supporting the faculty development, curricular enhancements, and research
              experiences that promote creativity and innovation from undergraduate students
              in Computer Science and Mathematics programs. Scholarship support will be
              provided to eligible students who have committed to pursue graduate level
              degree programs in Computer Science, Mathematics, or Engineering. 

This
              project includes nurturing and mentoring processes that will create a culture
              and mindset that are necessary to pursue graduate level courses. Tutorial
              programs, curricular enhancements, co-op and internship programs at major
              corporations and national laboratories, and a strong interaction with peers
              from other academic institutions and industry experts provide the required
              depth in the content area and improved professional development to all
              scholarship recipients. The knowledge and skills attained through these
              designed activities will enable graduates to further their education in
              Computer Science, Mathematics, and Engineering and successfully complete
              graduate degrees.
