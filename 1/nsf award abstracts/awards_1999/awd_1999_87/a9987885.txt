Abstract    :
              With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program of the
              Division of Chemistry and the Japan Program of the Division of International
              Programs support the Symposium on Molecular Oxygen and Organic Peroxides in
              Chemistry and Biology.  The symposium will bring together junior and senior
              chemists interested in the broad area of molecular oxidations and organic
              peroxides at the 2000 International Chemical Conference of Pacific Basin
              Societies which will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii during December 14-19, 2000. 
              Session topics include Synthesis and Reactivity of Organic Peroxides, Reactive
              Intermediates in Chemical and Biological Oxidations, Theoretical and
              Experimental Studies of Dioxygen and Molecular Oxidations, and a Poster
              Session.
