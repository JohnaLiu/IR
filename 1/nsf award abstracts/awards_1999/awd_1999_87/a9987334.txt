              ABSTRACT

Thorstensen, John
"Fundamental Astronomy of Cataclysmic
              Binaries"
AST-9987334

This project investigates the photometric and
              spectroscopic properties of cataclysmic variable star systems.  Three major
              efforts are being pursued: (1) continuation of a long-term program of orbital
              period determinations through radial velocity measurements, with special
              emphasis on systems which exhibit the 'superhump' phenomenon;  (2) initiation
              of an infrared photometry program for the determination of photometric
              parallaxes for the cool main sequence companion stars;  (3) initiation of a new
              imaging program for astrometry of selected systems that are believed to be
              nearest the Sun.  The observational effort for this project will be conducted
              with dedicated facilities at the MDM Observatory at Kitt Peak,
              Arizona.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Stellar
              Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
