Hammond, Kimberly A.

This project is to support a colony of
              deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) that are derived from a high altitude
              population in the White Mountains of California.  This species is unique
              because it carries a hemoglobin polymorphism that may confer an advantage for
              living at high altitudes under reduced oxygen and cold conditions.  Thus, the
              species is an ideal model for the initiation of a large-scale study of
              adaptation to high altitude or other hypoxic conditions in warm-blooded
              animals.  This colony is also Hanta virus (Sin Nombre strain) free so it is a
              valuable resource for Hanta virus research and represents no health or safety
              risks.  Finally, the colony is outbred and has been maintained to preserve
              maximum heterozygosity.

The colony will represent an excellent, Hanta virus
              free stock that will be of use to other researchers for the study of Hanta
              virus and its associated physiology in small mammals.  In addition, the colony
              will be an excellent resource for the study of the ecology an evolutionary
              biology of altitudinal acclimation and adaptation in small mammals.  The funds
              will support building of a breeding colony that will be deposited in the
              Peromyscus Stock Center at the University of South Carolina when they can be
              maintained and made widely available to other researchers.
