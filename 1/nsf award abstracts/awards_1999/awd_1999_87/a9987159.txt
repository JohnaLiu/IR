Abstract    :
              This grant will establish a scholarship fund to enable talented, low-income
              undergraduates to pursue baccalaureate degrees at the University of Washington
              in the College of Engineering, departments of Computer Science and Mathematics,
              and the Applied and Computational Mathematical Science (ACMS) program. This
              scholarship fund will significantly expand the amount of financial assistance
              available to these students, thereby increasing their retention, as well as
              their competitiveness for permanent job placement or enrollment in graduate
              degree programs. Scholarship recipients will be linked with an existing
              integrated network of successful student support programs where they will
              receive advising, mentoring, and professional development and leadership
              training. Another benefit, that cannot be underestimated, is that it will
              maximize the existing integration between the College of Engineering, Computer
              Science, Mathematics, and ACMS, as well as the University of Washington's (UW)
              student support structure.
