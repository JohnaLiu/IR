Abstract    :
              The United Nations Environment Program has convened representatives of national
              governments, inter-governmental bodies, and non-governmental
              organizations(NGOs), to reach a binding international agreement over a class of
              chemicals, 'persistent organic pollutants'(POPs). This controversy raises
              crucial issues about the relation between science, politics, and society.
              Following the methods introduced by Bruno Latour and his colleagues, this
              dissertation research project investigates the scientific commitments of NGOs
              from each of the four following discursive communities: the chlorine industry,
              international environmental groups, public health organizations, and indigenous
              peoples' organizations. The aim of this project is 1) for each discursive
              community to understand its particular perspective on the science of toxic
              chemicals, 2) for each of these scientific perspectives, to describe the
              network that gives it authority and stability, and 3) for each of these
              networks, to detail the social relations inherent in it (e.g.,unequal power
              relations, the dampening of certain voices and amplification of others). This
              study employs ethnographic methods, including observation of the conferences,
              interviews with participants, and textual analysis of the publications of the
              four subject NGOs. This analysis will contribute to a better understanding of
              the various, fundamentally different scientific perspectives that are engaged
              within the international debate on POPs, and of the distinct views of nature
              each contains.
