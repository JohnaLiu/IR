              ABSTRACT


This award is for partial support of the Midwestern Several
              Complex Variables Meeting to be held at Ann Arbor, MI on December 3-5, 1999.
              The regional Several Complex Variables Conferences play a crucial role for a
              large number of the research groups at Midwestern universities. This conference
              focuses on Pluripotential Theory - one of the central topics in modern complex
              function theory in several variables. The conference features several
              internationally known leaders in the field and accordingly will attract a large
              number of graduate students and young researchers from the American
              universities.  Most of the requested support will enable them to attend the
              conference. The event should be of significant benefit to a broader
              mathematical community.
