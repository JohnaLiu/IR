Abstract    :
              This project provides academically and financially qualified students majoring
              in mathematics or computer science with the financial assistance to complete
              their studies in a timely manner. The project has three objectives: to provide
              financial opportunities to enable qualified students to pursue a baccalaureate
              degree in computer science or mathematics to complete their education in a
              timely manner; to increase the number of graduates who find immediate
              employment in their field of study; and to increase the number of students who,
              upon graduation, seek a higher degree in mathematics and computer science.
              Junior, senior, and graduate students who meet the criteria both academically
              and financially have the opportunity to apply for the scholarships. The
              selected students are assured of cooperative positions during the school year
              and summer employment at companies with which the department has collaborative
              agreements. Upon graduation, scholarship recipients are expected to be employed
              in positions in their majors or to be admitted into a graduate program.
