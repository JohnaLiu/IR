Abstract    :
              This award will fund the development of a Standing Wave Total Internal
              Reflection Microscopy (SW-TIRM).  This microscope has the potential to provide
              lateral resolution better than one twelfth of the excitation wavelength. This
              technique is based on the formation of high frequency standing wave excitation
              in a total internal reflection geometry. Using a simple algorithm,
              high-resolution images can be re-constructed from a series of images at
              different phases of the standing wave. Of particular promise is the ability to
              perform non-contact imaging of biological specimens at a resolution that is
              comparable to or better than that of scanning probe microscopy. A preliminary
              SW-TIRM has been constructed to demonstrate the principle of this technique in
              1D.  With funding from this award, the capabilities of this current instrument
              will be extended from 1D to 2D and 3D, use scattered light instead of
              fluorescence, and incorporate digital deconvolution and two photon methods to
              image analysis.  Two graduate students will be directly involved in the
              development of this instrument.
