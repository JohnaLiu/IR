Abstract    :
              This project will utilize fast laser pulses to probe, alter, and control
              correlated electron dynamics in multi-electron atoms.  The experiments are
              expected to provide insight into a number of areas of current interest in
              fundamental atomic physics research, including intense field-atom 
              interactions, electron correlation in multi-electron systems, and the control
              of quantum dynamics.  Three sets of experiments are envisioned:  1) the study
              of double Rydberg wavepacket dynamics directly in the time domain; 2) the use
              of "half-cycle" pulses to investigate the modification of electron correlation
              by strong unipolar fields; and 3) the use of frequency-domain, scaled-energy
              spectroscopy to study the dynamics of two-electron atoms in the presence of
              strong static fields.
