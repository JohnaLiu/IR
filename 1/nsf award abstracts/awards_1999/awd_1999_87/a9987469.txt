Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT:  Several energy dissipation devices such as friction dampers, yielding
              metallic dampers, viscoelastic dampers, and viscous fluid dampers are now
              available as seismic protective systems for retrofitting existing structures or
              for the design of new structures.  Methods to design these systems such that
              they optimally achieve certain performance objectives are lagging far behind
              their hardware development. This research will develop a methodology for
              optimal placement and design of several commonly available energy dissipation
              systems to achieve certain structural performance objectives.  Since these
              devices have their own attributes and limitations, optimal combination of two
              or more different types of devices will be considered to extract the best
              performance from them.  For optimal search, the genetic algorithm-based
              procedures will be used.  The research will consider several basic, as well as
              more comprehensive, performance objectives.  The outcome of this research will
              be a practical methodology for optimal design of energy dissipating systems for
              building structures. It will facilitate and accelerate the use of these
              effective systems to design more safe and economical building structures.
