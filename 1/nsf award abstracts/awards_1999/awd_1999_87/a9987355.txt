              ABSTRACT

Bodenheimer, Peter
"Evolution of Protostellar
              Planets"
AST-9987417

Dr. Bodenheimer continues his investigation of the
              development and evolution of protostellar condensations and disks.  Particular
              emphasis will be placed on the development of protoplanets and their role in
              moderating the later stages of protostellar disks.  The results will directly
              contribute to a better understanding of how the solar system formed, and the
              most likely formation scenarios for the wide assortment of newly discovered
              extrasolar planets.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program
              for Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
