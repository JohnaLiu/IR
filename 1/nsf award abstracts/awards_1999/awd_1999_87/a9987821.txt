The Southern Regional Council on Statistics
              (SRCOS) and the American Statistical Association (ASA) are organizing a summer
              Research Conference in Statistics (SRCS) in June 2000 in Williamsburg,
              Virginia.  The objectives of the conference are to bring together senior
              researchers, young researchers, and advanced doctoral students to focus on
              several current research areas in Statistics, as well as to discuss some
              current and future issues in statistical education and training, in a relaxed
              and informal setting.  The conference is intended to be small, with
              approximately 50-60 participants mostly from the fourteen-state SRCOS region. 
              This size allows for maximum participant interactions for the 3 1/2 days
              duration.  Standard sessions consist of invited one hour talks with all
              speakers urged to give detailed background and review at the beginning of the
              talks, leading up to current results, problems, and issues on their topics. 
              This format provides an entry point into the research topic for participants
              interested in beginning to investigate new areas, especially young
              researchers.

The SRCS in year 2000 is a special conference with the emphasis
              on topics in "Industrial Statistics" in honor of the well-known statistician,
              Professor Stuart Hunter.  A poster session by advanced doctoral students and
              young researchers also reflect this theme.  A special four-hour session on day
              one will feature Dr. Hunter and four to five other well-known researchers and
              is designated as  "Stu Hunter Day."  The special emphasis provides the doctoral
              students and young researchers with a unique opportunity to become acquainted
              with, and interact with these senior researchers over the entire conference. 
              The students would most likely not have such an opportunity otherwise. and the
              NSF is funding support for eight doctoral students to participate.
