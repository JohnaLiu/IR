Abstract    :
              This project will combine and rehouse the collections of the Louisiana State
              University Herbaria.  New cabinets will be used to replace inadequate ones, to
              relieve overcrowding, and to provide for future expansion.  Collections of the
              LSU Herbaria consist of bryophytes, fungi, lichens, and vascular plants.  The
              vascular plant collection at LSU is one of the oldest in the Gulf South.  Among
              its holdings are important historical collections, numerous types, and an
              excellent taxonomic and geographic representation of plants from this region
              and of the New World.  The institution has provided new space for the
              herbarium, and these funds will be used to provide additional cabinets and a
              compactor storage system for greater efficiency and improvement of access for
              outside researchers.
