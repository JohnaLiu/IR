Abstract    :
              This project initiates the Academic Diversity in Computer Science Program at the
              University of Connecticut. The program provides financial and academic support
              to a group of talented low-income students working towards a bachelor's degree
              in Computer Science. The students in this program also gain a significant
              background in a secondary discipline, either as a major or minor concentration.
              The program is designed to appeal to students with broad interests and works
              with organizations on campus to help recruit students from populations
              generally under-represented in Computer Science. Students are in this program
              for the final three years as undergraduates, and receive this scholarship
              support for the first two years. The program admits twenty students per year
              who have access to additional academic support in the form of student tutors
              and participation in a mentoring relationship. The Teaching and Learning
              Institute on campus interacts with the project to examine pedagogical issues
              that may arise in having a more diverse student population in the Computer
              Science Department.
