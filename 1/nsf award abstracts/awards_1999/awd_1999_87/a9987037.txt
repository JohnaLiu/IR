Abstract    :
              The Colorado School of Mines (CSM) is dedicated to the belief that women and
              minorities can make unique and substantial contributions to science related
              fields. A broad range of programs, such as the Women in Science, Engineering
              and Mathematics program (WISEM) and the Minority Engineering program (MEP), are
              dedicated to improving the retention and advancement of women and minorities at
              CSM. This project provides financial assistance for economically burdened
              female and minority students who are attending the Colorado School of Mines. It
              is our belief that by combining the high quality programs that are already
              offered for the retention of women and minorities with appropriate financial
              support, the female and minority population at CSM will continue to increase.
              Additionally, the project contains a strong research and mentoring component.
              The mentoring component is designed to provide the scholarship recipients with
              the guidance and encouragement necessary to complete their degrees while the
              research component is designed to further excite the participants' interest in
              science related fields.
