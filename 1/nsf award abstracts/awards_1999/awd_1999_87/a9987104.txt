Fundamental and substantial improvements in the performance
              of millimeter and submillimeter-wave multipliers will produce more reliable
              varactor  multipliers with improved bandwidth and efficiency at terahertz
              frequencies which will enable high-sensitivity observations in the one of the
              least explored and most important regime of the electromagnetic
              spectrum.

This three-year program focuses on three phases of development. 
              I) development of diode-based submillimeter-wave integrated circuits MMIC's, 2)
              the integration of electromagnetic and device simulation tools for IC
              multiplier design at terahertz frequencies, and 3) a comprehensive
              investigation of integrated multiplier systems, including the dynamics of
              cascaded multiplier stages.

The development of submillimeter-wave MMIC's
              will also have significant impact on fields such as atmospheric remote sensing,
              chemical spectroscopy, high-resolution radar and will open the terahertz region
              of the spectrum for greater use and broader scientific investigation.
