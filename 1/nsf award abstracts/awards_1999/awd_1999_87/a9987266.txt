"The Origin of Binary Stars"
AST-9987266

Dr. Stahler is
              conducting an observational and theoretical investigation of the earliest
              stages of the binary star formation process.  He has selected a sample of
              mid-infrared (IR) sources that are likely to be the sites of early star
              formation.  The IRTF, CTIO and Keck telescopes will be used to image them at 5,
              10, and 20 micrometers.  Using this new data, along with published near-IR
              data, he will reconstruct each source's emitted spectral energy distribution
              and identify any pairs of condensation nuclei that may signal binary protostar
              formation.  In parallel with the observational work, Stahler will construct
              detailed numerical models of elongated magnetized cloud cores.  These models
              will be evolved through the point at which one or more condensation nuclei
              form.  The goal of this effort will be to reproduce in these models the
              luminosity and spatial separation of any primitive binary detected, and to
              identify the parameters which govern the formation of multiple
              systems.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Stellar
              Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
