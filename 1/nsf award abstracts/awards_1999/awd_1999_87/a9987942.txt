Abstract    :
              Four research questions will guide the project's work:

1 - What are the most
              effective ways the data sets submitted to NSF by systemic initiatives can be
              used for evaluating the success of systemic reform and understanding its
              dynamics, both winthin and across SIs?

2 - How is the precision of analysis
              required to answer research question #1 above dependent upon qualities of the
              student assessments and data, including reliability, validity, and
              comparability of the tests?

3 - What analytic statistical models best fit
              the data linking the systemic initiative to student achievement and how can
              these be demonstrated in a prototyype analyses?

4 - What lessons can be
              learned and communicated to the field from this project about the kind of
              database design and analysis that is more and less useful for evaluating and
              understanding systemic reform?
