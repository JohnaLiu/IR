              Abstract
9987791

A magnitude 7.4 earthquake occurred on August 17, 1999 in
              the area of Izmit, Turkey, 60 km to the east of Istanbul, resulting in
              extensive damage, injuries and loss of life.  This earthquake occurred along
              the North Anatolian fault, a strike slip fault that has many similarities to
              the San Andreas fault in California.

This action provides partial support
              for a 14-member reconnaissance team that was dispatched shortly after the
              earthquake to document the geotechnical, engineering geology/seismology, and
              tsunamigenic features of this earthquake in as much detail as possible.  This
              team coordinated with other reconnaissance teams from Turkey, Japan and the
              United States.

As with all post-earthquake reconnaissance investigations, it
              is expected that vital records and data will become available as a result of
              this earthquake in Turkey.  From a scientific viewpoint, these large
              earthquakes act as full scale experiments that cannot be duplicated via
              controlled experiments in the laboratory or in the field.  It is through quick
              response reconnaissance efforts that the mostly-ephemeral data from these
              events can be recovered and used to further advances in earthquake hazard
              mitigation.  The results from this investigation are expected to yield
              information and data that will help the profession to understand the effects of
              large-scale strike slip fault systems on urbanized and industrial
              areas.

This is a multi-institutional award involving the University of
              California at Berkeley and the University of Southern California.
