Unwanted radio signals block radio astronomers access to
              important scientific information about the universe.  Man's increasing desire
              to be connected for communication produces a proliferation of man made RF and
              microwave sources.  Prevention measurements through FCC regulation and ITU
              agreements are effective, but do not provide a viable final solution to an
              increasing problem.

This proposal is to develop adaptive algorithms for
              interference cancellation and to evaluate their ability to remove interference
              from radio telescopes.  In addition a hardware/software prototype system, built
              on the principles developed in the first part of the proposal will be applied
              to the real-world problem of removing interference caused by Russian Federation
              Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS).  This will be demonstrated
              without manual demonstration.
