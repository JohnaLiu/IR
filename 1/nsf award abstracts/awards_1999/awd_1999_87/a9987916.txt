Abstract    :
              This award supports an extensive research program in the area of strong field
              quantum control of atomic and molecular processes.  The research encompasses
              four areas:  1) studies of non-sequential strong-field photoionization, with a
              principal focus on the problem of multiple ionization in strong laser fields; 
              2) strong-field control of intra-molecular processes, using programmed rotating
              linearly polarized laser fields to produce rovibrational redistributions within
              the molecule; 3)  studies of sculpted wave packets, with a focus on the mutual
              entanglement of multiple Rydberg atoms; and 4) search for strong-field
              algorithms for bond-selective molecular excitation.
