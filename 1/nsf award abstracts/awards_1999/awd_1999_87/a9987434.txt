In this project the principal investigator
              proposes to use 
both algebraic and topological methods to study a number of
              
basic questions in transformation groups, group cohomology 
and related
              topics. In particular he proposes to study the 
phenomenon of periodicity in
              group cohomology via group actions; 
to analyze the cohomology of certain
              Galois groups arising 
from basic questions in field theory; to calculate the
              
cohomology of low rank sporadic simple groups; and to 
investigate a number
              of miscellaneous problems where a 
significant interplay of algebra and
              topology is apparent.

Topology measures intrinsic properties of mathematical
              objects 
which are invariant under deformations like twisting and pulling.
              
In particular symmetries can be fruitfully studied by using 
topological
              methods. Examples arise from physics as well as 
other natural sciences and
              obtaining precise mathematical methods 
for their study is a challenging
              topic. This project proposes 
to use recently developed mathematical
              techniques as well 
as computer assisted calculations to achieve this in
              a
number of different instances which are known to be of 
significant
              interest.
