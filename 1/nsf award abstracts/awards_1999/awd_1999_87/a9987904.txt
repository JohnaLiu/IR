Abstract    :
              The University of Pittsburgh Research Experiences for Undergraduates in
              Physics-Focus on Minorities is based at the University of Pittsburgh, but has a
              partnership with Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, with use of
              facilities at the University of Missouri at St. Louis. In summer 2000 we
              anticipate physics research opportunities with faculty in: astrophysics,
              elementary particle, nuclear, and condensed matter physics; molecular beam
              scattering and fast pulsed optics studies in physical chemistry; and materials
              science, and biomechanical and mechanical engineering.  Program participants
              are typically about 2/3 ethnic minority and over half female, with  about 10%
              of the participants  "traditional" physics students-white male.   Students
              typically spend 55 or more hours per week on program activities, including
              weekly "lecture lunches", informal academic work in support of their research
              or academic goals, and mentoring and tutoring of less advanced students.
