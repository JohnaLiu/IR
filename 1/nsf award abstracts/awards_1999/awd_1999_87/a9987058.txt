Abstract    :
              The Purdue University School of Science (Departments of Computer Science and
              Mathematics), School of Technology (Engineering Technology Departments and the
              Departments of Computer Technology and Computer Graphics Technology), and the
              professional Schools of Engineering (Aeronautics, Agricultural and Biological,
              Chemical, Civil, Construction and Management, Electrical and Computer,
              Industrial, Interdisciplinary, Materials, Mechanical, and Nuclear), are joining
              together to administer the Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics
              Scholarship Program.  This project is improving student access and retention by
              expanding and enhancing long-term, well developed, institutionalized programs
              at Purdue University aimed at broadening the opportunities and enabling the
              full-time enrollment and participation of a cross-section of our financially
              needy students in the sciences and engineering.  The project is increasing the
              total number of low-income, but academically talented, students who complete
              their degrees in a timely manner, and also increasing the number of women and
              underrepresented minority students receiving their bachelor degrees in CSEMS
              disciplines.

A careful nomination and selection procedure is being used to
              ensure program goals are met and 40 scholarship slots are filled each year
              (juniors and seniors).  In addition to support programs already in place on the
              campus of Purdue University, scholarship recipients are meeting weekly in small
              groups with engineering, science and technology faculty in order to discuss
              career options, choices and campus and societal issues.  The students are being
              afforded interdisciplinary research opportunities and are participating in
              poster displays and on-campus research gatherings during which their own
              research is being discussed with other students, faculty, and the general
              public.  Four graduate assistants are working closely with the PI.  They are
              participating in mentoring and tutorial activities and helping to ensure that
              the scholarship recipients 'stay on track', both academically and in a personal
              sense, for 'on time' graduations in CSEMS fields and successful transitions to
              the work force or to educational programs leading to advanced degrees.
