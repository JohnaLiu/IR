Abstract    :
              This award to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology will enable
              NMIMT to acquire low-latency, high bandwidth connectivity to either or both of
              the vBNS or Abilene networks via the New Mexico gigapop located at the
              University of New Mexico.  The connectivity allows NMIMT researchers to access
              important national computational resources and to conduct research in new voice
              and large format display technologies for distributed group interactions.  In
              addition, the connectivity includes support for access to radio telescopes (VLA
              and VLBA) managed by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), thus
              bringing these resources into the national research infrastructure for the
              benefit of the larger community.  This award is being jointly supported by
              CISE/ANIR, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the MPS Division
              of Astronomical Sciences.
