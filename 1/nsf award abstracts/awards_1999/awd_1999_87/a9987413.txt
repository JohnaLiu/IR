Abstract    :
              The University of Rochester's REU program in Physics enables sophomores and
              juniors nationwide to undertake summer research projects with members of the
              Department of Physics and Astronomy, and aims at 50% participation by women and
              underrepresented minorities. Students choose from the following experimental
              and theoretical research areas: particle and nuclear physics; quantum optics
              and lasers; astrophysics and infrared astronomy; condensed matter physics;
              biological and medical physics; plasma physics; and physics education.
              Students' research work is augmented by mini-courses in electronics and
              machining, weekly lunchtime discussions, excursions in the Rochester area, and
              opportunities to engage in the department's community outreach activities. 
              Students prepare abstracts and presentations of their results, and are
              encouraged (and provided financial support) to present their work at national
              conferences, such as NCUR, meetings of the American Physical Society, and the
              Rochester Symposium for Physics Students.
