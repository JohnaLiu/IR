Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Drs. Michael A.
              Nichols, David W. Ewing, David P. Mascotti and other members of the Chemistry
              Department at the John Carroll University in establishing and conducting a new
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period
              2000-2002 24  undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each conducting
              summer research under the supervision of Chemistry faculty.  Participants will
              be involved in research projects in experimental and theoretical physical
              chemistry, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, inorganic chemistry and
              biochemistry. Close interaction with faculty and their undergraduate research
              co-workers  will expose each student to a breadth of chemical research
              activities. In addition there will be field trips to local commercial and other
              research organizations.

 The Ethics and Values Studies program will support
              development of an ethics and values curriculum using case studies to identify
              and analyze ethical dilemmas and foster ethical behavior.
