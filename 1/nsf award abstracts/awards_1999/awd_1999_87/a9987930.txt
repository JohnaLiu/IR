Abstract    :
              This award provides renewed funding for an REU site at the Virginia Institute of
              Marine Science (VIMS), College of William and Mary. The award will support ten
              undergraduate students each year during a 10-week summer research internship.
              To date, the program has supported a total of 84 interns, of which 73 were from
              minority groups, and has supported 35 additional interns with funding from
              other sources. During the next three years, the program expects to have at
              least 12-15 interns per year supported with NSF and other funding. The
              internship program focuses on interdisciplinary coastal marine science,
              particularly processes operating in the local estuarine environment.
              Substantial cost-sharing will be provided by the University.
