Abstract    :
              This project will improve and enhance the lepidopteran collections at the
              Carnegie Museum of Natural History.  The entomological collections are
              scientific resources of international significance, containing 6.9 million
              prepared specimens with about 6 million unprepared.  Among New World
              collections, it has the second largest collections of Lepidoptera and the most
              diverse collection of Afrotropical insects.  More than 60% of the historical
              Lepidoptera collection remains in unaccptable, precarious housing, and is
              jeopardizing specimen integrity.  The two year project will rehouse those
              portions of the historical Lepidoptera collection by providing acceptable
              storage for more than half of the specimens, providing conservation of
              specimens of exceptional scientific calue or concern, and providing sorting and
              preliminary curation of Lepidoptera families represented by high numbers of
              prepared but unsorted specimens.
