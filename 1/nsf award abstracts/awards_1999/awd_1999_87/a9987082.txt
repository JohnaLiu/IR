Abstract    :
              The primary objective of the CTAS/CSEMS Program is to provide educational
              opportunities to low-income, academically talented students through
              scholarships that promote full-time enrollment and baccalaureate and master's
              degree achievement in computer technology and engineering technology. The ASU
              East College of Technology and Applied Sciences has established this
              scholarship program for 30 Bachelor of Science and 10 Master of Science in
              Technology students. Scholarship support is provided to students who meet the
              CTAS/CSEMS eligibility criteria and who compete successfully in a selection
              process administered by the CTAS/CSEMS Selection Committee. Selected students
              benefit from studying under the direction of faculty at a research university
              in a high-technology industrial environment. Knowledge and skills are developed
              with the aid of contextual laboratory experiences reinforced by opportunities
              to directly interact with world-class business and industry representatives,
              their facilities and operations. The program reflects the national workforce
              need to substantially increase the number of graduates of baccalaureate, and
              graduate degree programs in the fields of engineering technology, with special
              focus on computer engineering technology, electronics/semiconductor engineering
              technology, manufacturing engineering technology and aeronautical engineering
              technology.
