This award to University of Texas at Austin will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Longhorn, a research
              vessel operated by the university's Marine Science Institute as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              instrumentation to be acquired includes a debubbler system for analysis of
              surface seawater and a transmissometer for study of water clarity throughout
              the water column.  The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist
              marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in  the Gulf of Mexico, during
              2000 and future years.
