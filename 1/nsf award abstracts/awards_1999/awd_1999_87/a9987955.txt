Abstract    :
              The principle goal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Mathematics
              program at California State University San Bernardino is to provide promising
              undergraduate math majors with a meaningful, exciting and challenging
              experience in mathematical research.  Eight undergraduate mathematics students
              will be recruited from universities and colleges within the Southeren
              California region, with special emphasis on students from groups that are
              underrepresented in mathematics.  During the eight-week residential program
              students will carry out guided independent and collaborative research. 
              Participants will first study background material as a large group and then
              break into two groups of four, for further study in either combinatorics or not
              theory.  Each participant will choose, in consultation with one of the
              directors of the program, a problem withing their focus area to investigate. 
              At the end of the program, students will submit research papers based on their
              work, and will present their results at a program closing seminar.
