The REU Site involves a field, analytical, experimental,
              and theoretical study of geological fluids.  Research will range from surface
              and near-surface fluid systems to the mantle to the core.  Fourteen
              undergraduate students will be recruited nationally each year.  The students
              will investigate topics with the common theme of fluids in the Earth.  The
              interns will be involved in various research activities, including the impacts
              of human activities on groundwater quality primarily in karst and fractured
              rock aquifers, the role of fluids in crustal processes through basin-scale
              hydrogeologic modeling, limnogeology research on lakes to understand regional
              environmental dynamics, evaluation of the chemical and mechanical effects of
              fluids in metamorphic and igneous systems, the effect of melt on rheology of
              mantle rocks, and numerical hands-on experience with mantle convection and core
              dynamics using scientific visualization.  In addition, they will be exposed to
              disciplines outside their summer research by participating in field trips to
              mid-western sites (caves, glacial lake/river features, mid-continent rift
              lavas), by touring a wide range of laboratory facilities (rock magnetism,
              isotope geochemistry, rock mechanics, electron microscopy) at the University of
              Minnesota and vicinity, and by taking part in university summer internship
              programs in a wide range of fields (chemistry, biology, physics, interfacial
              engineering, environmental sciences).
