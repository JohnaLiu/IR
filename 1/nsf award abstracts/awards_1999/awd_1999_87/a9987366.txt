The Owens Valley Solar Array radio telescope will
              provide a unique set of multifrequency microwave imaging observations of flares
              and active regions during the upcoming solar maximum period.  The facility will
              be upgraded to accommodate additional baselines that will improve the spatial
              resolution of solar observations by up to a factor of three.  During the next
              solar maximum period two primary scientific goals will be pursued:  (1)
              development of three-dimensional imaging techniques to determine the emission
              source vs. height structure of transient structures in the solar atmosphere;
              and (2) a detailed investigation of the acceleration of high-energy particles
              due to magnetic field reconnection events.  The latter investigation will
              provide critical radio frequency ground-based support for the NASA High-Energy
              Solar Spectroscopic Imager (HESSI) X-ray observations of the active
              Sun.

Funding for this project was provided by the NSF programs for Stellar

              Research (ATM/STR).
