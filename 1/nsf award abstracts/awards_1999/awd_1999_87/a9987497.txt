This project provides partial support for the
              International Symposium on Quantum Fluids and Solids that will be held at the
              University of Minnesota, June 6-11, 2000. There will be approximately 225
              participants, mostly from the United States, but also from other nations, such
              as those represented in the European Community, as well as Japan and Russia.
              Both experimental and theoretical research areas will be covered. Topics
              include Two-Dimensional Quantum Fluids, Superfluidity, Bose-Einstein
              Condensates, Microgravity Physics, Phase Transitions, etc. The NSF support will
              provide meeting expenses for approximately 25 graduate students, post-doctoral
              associates or young faculty. The Symposium provides opportunities for graduate
              students to make presentations at both oral and poster sessions. Dissemination
              of scientific results on an international level is another positive feature of
              this project.

              research, applied research and instrument development will be included among
              the topics at the Symposium. The research is in the field of Low Temperature
              Physics, which focuses on phenomena occurring near 'absolute zero'. This
              includes superfluidity and superconductivity. The NSF support will provide
              meeting expenses for approximately 25 graduate students, post-doctoral
              associates or young faculty. The Symposium provides opportunities for graduate
