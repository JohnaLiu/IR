The investigators will
              work to understand the evolution in space and time of magnetic flux, intensity
              and free energy at scales below the resolution of observations. The main effort
              is to fit sophisticated mathematical spectral functions to the observations of
              the larger scales and then extrapolate to the small scales below the limit of
              observational resolution to see what can be learned about heating the solar
              corona. The corona that provides both the solar wind and the X-ray emission of
              the Sun and, so far, the energy input that maintains the temperature is not
              firmly established. Specifically, the investigators will separate the cellular
              and turbulent components of the motion in the photosphere, which is of prime
              interest in the basic problem of coronal heating. Occasional mysterious rapid
              motion of magnetic footpoints has to date received little attention, in spite
              of its potential contribution to coronal heating. The investigation is intended
              to quantify the energy contribution that the sudden motions make.
