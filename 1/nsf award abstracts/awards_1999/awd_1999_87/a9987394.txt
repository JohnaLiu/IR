The scientific research and educational system of the
              United States depends on the ready availability of information. Increasingly,
              this information is being made available for wide distribution via the
              Internet.There is currently very little content involving evolutionary and
              population biology available on the Internet, and that which is available is
              not well organized or easily found. This hinders communication between
              scientific researchers, as well as their access to important research resources
              such as data analysis software. More significantly, a lack of information
              limits the potential that the Internet has for greatly enhancing education in
              these areas of biology. This has an impact not only on students who might be
              using the Internet as a research tool, but also on teachers and professors who
              could enhance their courses with appropriate supporting materials and
              ideas.

This project addresses this deficiency by creating a website,
              EvoNet.org, focusing on the collection, organization, and distribution of
              research and educational information regarding evolutionary and population
              biology. Development of this site enhances and supports research and education
              in the biological sciences in general, and provides an important contribution
              to the informational infrastructure of science.
