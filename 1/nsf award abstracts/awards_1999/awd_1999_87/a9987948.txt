Abstract    :
              The objective of this research  is to explore experimentally the response of
              excited atoms to microwave fields at frequencies comparable to the natural
              frequencies of the atoms.  In principle, such a field converts a quantum
              mechanical atom to a nearly classical atom in which the atomic electron's
              motion is locked to the external field.  The extent to which the atom has
              become classical is probed using laser pulses to determine where the electron
              is at different phases of the microwave field.  Experiments to explore the
              feasibility of changing the quantum state of the atom by changing the microwave
              frequency are planned.  Overall, the program should enhance the understanding
              of the relation between quantum and classical systems and provide new insights
              into ways to control quantum systems.
