Abstract    :
              The goal of this Scholarship Program is: To encourage high achieving, low-income
              students, particularly of groups underrepresented in science, mathematics,
              engineering and technology, to pursue and attain degrees in Computer Science,
              Engineering, and Mathematics by providing sufficient scholarship funding to
              allow full-time enrollment in those disciplines. 

Although applications of
              all students who meet the guidelines of financial need and a strong interest in
              the eligible disciplines will be welcomed, aggressive efforts will be made to
              recruit minorities under represented in Mathematics, Science and Engineering,
              and females. The Division of Sciences and Engineering will lead the effort to
              recruit and retain the eligible students, with the assistance of the several
              offices within the Student Services area, including the Financial Aid Office,
              the Advising and Counseling, Peer Tutoring, and the Accessibility Offices.
              

The scholarship recipients will be encouraged to take of advantage of the
              institution's Cooperative Education Program to gain hands on experiences in
              their areas of interest. Each student will be assigned a mentor within their
              discipline and will meet with that mentor periodically for academic advice as
              well as those concerning transfer and employment possibilities. The final
              report of the project will evaluate its success by number of Associate of
              Science (traditional transfer curriculum), Associate of Applied Science
              (technical employment readiness) degrees, and successful transfer and/or
              employment.
