Abstract    :
              The project researches interconnect-dominated floorplanning. The floorplanning
              organizes the topology of wires and the assignment of buffers while placement
              and routing are structured as supporting tools to fulfill the design
              requirements. The project includes exploration of the following. Technology
              Floorplanning: Given a circuit design project, the technology floorplanning
              identifies the technology that provides the best interconnect capability in
              terms of cost and performance. Logic Floorplanning with a Hierarchical Design
              Framework: A logic floorplanning takes advantage of the design hierarchy and
              derives the effect of interconnect delay. Physical Layout Floorplanning:
              Physical layout floorplanning serves as a foundation to support the
              interconnect optimization operations.
