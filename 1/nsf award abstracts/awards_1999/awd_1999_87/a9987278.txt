A spectrum analyzer for radio astronomy
              observations of millisecond pulsars in globular clusters and in selected field
              regions will be designed and built.  This instrumentation will add to our
              understanding of stellar evolution.  Precision timing of millisecond pulsars
              will probe the long-wavelength end of the cosmic gravitational wave background.
               The coalescence of super massive black holes of varying masses may be detected
              by sensing the gravitationally induced radiation they emit.  The
              instrumentation will be a spectrum analyzer with 10 to 100 Mega Hertz bandwidth
              per card.  Five approaches will be considered and one selected for
              implementation.  The plan is to examine the technology and to use the most
              rapidly developing and popular architecture available in a commercial device
              that both has an extensive user base an da solid support framework.  The most
              likely approach is to use an array of commercially available digital signal
              processors for the spectrum analyzer.  High-speed processors in the range of 1
              giga floating point operations per second are being considered.
