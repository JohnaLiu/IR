Abstract    :
              This award provides for the continuation of a project to measure hyperfine
              spectra in sequences of vibrational and rotational states in small molecules,
              such as alkali halides or hydroxides, using a high-resolution molecular beam
              electric resonance spectrometer.  These spectra will provide improved values
              for hyperfine interaction constants, to be compared with those obtained from
              theoretical calculations of electron wave functions.  Systematic variations of
              the interactions with isotopic substitution and between the different alkali
              halide molecules will be examined.  Undergraduate physics majors will work with
              faculty as colleagues in all aspects of the work.
