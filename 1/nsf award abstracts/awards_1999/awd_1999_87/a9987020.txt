The Advanced Manufacturing Center (AMC) at Cleveland State
              University (CSU) is administering scholarship support to 40 engineering,
              engineering technology, and computer science students from CSU and three area
              community colleges. The AMC-NSF Career Scholarships in Engineering and Computer
              Science expects to graduate 15 community college students with an associate's
              degree and 25 CSU students with a bachelor's degree in engineering, engineering
              technology, or computer science. Recruitment efforts are particularly seeking
              to increase the numbers of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in
              the targeted majors above. All scholarship recipients participate in an
              application-oriented work experience at CSU's Advanced Manufacturing Center
              (AMC) for 20 hours a week during the academic year and 40 hours during the
              summer. One of the unique features of the AMC experience is the
              cross-disciplinary, full-cycle nature of the industrial projects it sponsors.
              Industrial companies come to the AMC with real problems and faculty, staff, and
              students work together to create solutions for those problems. Students learn
              manufacturing and technological engineering from conception of an idea to
              completion of a product or process. The quality of work produced by the AMC
              students leads to 100% of AMC students receiving job offers. Several features
              of this scholarship program stand out. First, by including area community
              colleges as partners, students who may stop at the associate degree level are
              encouraged to finish their studies at a four-year institution. Second, the
              part-time CSU students recruited gain the incentive to enroll full-time, thus
              improving retention and time-to-graduation rates. Third, the NSF grant of
              $2,500 results in a financial package of up to $15,400 for transfer students
              and part-time students with financial need; this is a very high rate of return
              on the federal investment. Finally, participation in an internship as a
              requirement of scholarship acceptance is a new practice at CSU, and has the
              potential to encompass other CSU scholarship programs.  Cleveland-area
              manufacturers are also gaining access to highly qualified graduates with
              technical and managerial skills learned through the Advanced Manufacturing
              Center internship.
