This award to University of Alaska Fairbanks will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Alpha Helix, a
              research vessel operated by the University's Institute of Marine Science as
              part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.
              Specific instrumentation to be acquired for shipboard use includes an optical
              plankton counter, CTD instrumentation, shipboard computers and software,
              sampling bottles, chlorophyll standards and a convection oven. The shared-use
              instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies,
              particularly along the coast of Alaska, in the Gulf of Alaska and in the Bering
              Sea, during 2000 and future years.
