Abstract    :
              This RUI project focuses on precision measurements of fundamental symmetries. 
              Three different measurements are to be undertaken:  1) the current Amherst edm
              measurement in Cs will be continued, with technical innovations to the
              experiment that should result in a value that is improved by a factor of 20
              over the current Cs limit;  2) measurements of the hyperfine splittings,
              isotope shifts, and g-factors for the a(1) state of PbO will be undertaken to
              provide essential support for the new edm measurement that is being initiated
              at Yale University; and 3) the search for a violation of local Lorentz
              invariance (LLI) and CPT, for which the existing Amherst value provides the
              best laboratory limits, will be renewed.  This renewed undertaking is prompted
              by recent theoretical results that provide a coherent theory that allows for
              both LLI and CPT nonconservation.
