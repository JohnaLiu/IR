Abstract    :
              Undergraduate students work with a Santa Fe Institute faculty mentor on an
              individual project focusing on some aspect of the computational properties of
              complex systems. SFI's broad program of research is aimed at understanding both
              the common features of complex systems and at comprehending the enormous
              diversity of specific examples. Projects focus on adaptive computation;
              physics, mathematics, information science, and computational aspects of
              complexity; economics as a complex,adaptive system; and the life sciences
              including modeling of the immune system, theoretical neurobiology, genetic data
              analysis, theoretical ecology, and models of protein folding. This program is
              highly individualized. Each student works with one or more faculty mentors on a
              specific self-selected project. Participants are expected to be in residence
              approximately 10 weeks, within the approximate mid-May to mid-August window.
