Techniques of far-infrared polarimetry developed at
              the University of Chicago have made it possible to produce maps of polarization
              at hundreds of points in individual clouds in our Galaxy.  Maps of magnetic
              field lines in these clouds can be inferred by rotating the polarization
              vectors through 90 degrees.  The principal objective of this project, led by
              Dr. Roger Hildebrand, is to test the hypothesis that radiation from stars
              embedded in clouds or radiation penetrating the clouds from the external
              stellar radiation field strongly facilitates magnetic alignment of the grains
              that are responsible for the thermal emission.  A second objective is to
              determine the properties of magnetic fields in star forming regions.  These
              investigations use the University of Chicago polarimeter, known as Hertz, on
              the Cal Tech Submillimeter Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  This project is
              funded through the Galactic Astronomy Program.
