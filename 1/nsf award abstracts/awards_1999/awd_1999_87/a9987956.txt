Abstract    :
              The double photoejection of two electrons from He by either photoionization or
              by the Compton process is of great interest.  There are outstanding problems
              involving electron correlation in three-body Coulomb systems which are probed
              by the proposed experiments.  Comparison with theory will be made where
              possible.
