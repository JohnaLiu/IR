This research is a systematic, basic study of the reliability of
              solder joints undergoing a combination of mechanical, chemical and electrical
              forces. The project examines one of the most challenging reliability issues in
              electronic packaging technology. Electromigration is measured in SnPb and
              Pb-free solders from room temperature to 150C. The effect of electromigration
              on interfacial reactions is determined at the solder joint interfaces. Also
              studied is the effect of stress on electromigration. The combined effects are
              examined on the durability of a flip chip solder joint. On the basis of these
              studies, insight should be developed that will enable useful solutions to
              enhancing solder joint reliability.

In consumer electronic goods as well
              as in microprocessors, the current trend is to attach the silicon chip directly
              to an organic substrate. Smart card is a good example. It is called direct chip
              attachment or flip chip technology in which an area array of solder bumps is
              used to join the chip to the substrate. This is a low cost process, which
              offers the large number of electrical leads (over a few thousands) required for
              packaging a high performance chip. However, the very large difference in
              coefficients of thermal expansion between the chip and the organic substrate
              results in thermal stresses that can create a serious reliability issue. Owing
              to the organic nature of the substrate, the use of a low melting point solder
              such as eutectic SnPb or eutectic SnAg (Pb-free) alloy is needed. These high-Sn
              solders react extremely fast with the under-bump thin film metallization on the
              chip surface, resulting in mechanically very weak joints. Furthermore, for
              future ULSI chips, the size of the solder bump could approach 50 microns.  Then
              electromigration becomes a concern since the solder has a fast atomic
              diffusivity near ambient temperature.
