Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Drs. Thomas Cundari,
              Abby Parrill and other members of the Chemistry Department at the University of
              Memphis in establishing and conducting a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002 21
              undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each conducting summer research
              under the supervision of Chemistry faculty. Synergism between theory and
              experiment will be emphasized through the interdisciplinary and collaborative
              nature of the research projects. The program will take advantage of the
              University's Computational Research on Materials Institute and participants
              cwill be able to choose from among a wide variety of chemical projects
              including: analysis and design of photoactive organometallics, spectroscopic
              analysis of metal complexes and computation of molecular electronic structure.
              A computational chemistry short course and a workshop on scientific ethics and
              values will be integrated into the REU experience.
