Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Dr. Mary K. Boyd and
              other members of the Chemistry Department at Loyola University of Chicago in
              continuing a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry.
              For the period 2000-2002, 30 undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each
              conducting summer research in organic, inorganic, physical, analytical, and
              biological chemistry under the supervision of Chemistry faculty. Participants
              will be integrated into a research group with other undergraduates, graduate
              students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty. In addition to weekly research
              meetings participants will take part in field trips to corporate and government
              laboratories such as Argonne National Laboratory, Fermilab, Abbott Labs and
              Amoco .  Students will present their research at a Symposium at the end of the
              summer and will be encouraged to submit papers at the two undergraduate
              research symposia held annually in the Chicago area.
