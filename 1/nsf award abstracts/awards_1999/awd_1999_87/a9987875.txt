Abstract    :
              The principal goal of the Summer Undergraduate Research Program in Physics at
              the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility is to provide promising undergraduate
              physics majors with a meaningful, exciting and challenging experience in
              scientific research.  We propose to sponsor the participation of at least 12
              students per year in experimental and theoretical research projects at IUCF and
              the Nuclear Theory Center for 10-week summer terms.  We will recruit excellent
              students from colleges and institutions throughout the U.S.,with preference to
              institutions within the Midwest as well as small institutions where research
              opportunities for undergraduates may be limited.  It is expected that 90% of
              the students will come from institutions other than Indiana University at
              Bloomington, and that at least 25% of the students will be women.  The
              participants will gain direct research experience by working on projects in
              nuclear physics, accelerator physics, and medical physics under the supervision
              of faculty members and senior scientific staff.  Special programs for the
              students will be arranged, including orientation sessions, weekly seminars on
              current research in physics, and machine shop and scientific computer
              programming mini-courses.  At the end of the summer term, the students will
              submit research papers based on their work, and will present their results in
              seminars at a closing symposium.
