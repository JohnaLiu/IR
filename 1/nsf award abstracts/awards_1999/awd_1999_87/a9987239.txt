Abstract    :
              The project will establish a scholarship program that will enhance the ability
              of students to obtain baccalaureate degrees in computer science within four
              years. More specifically, the project will:

Establish a scholarship
              recruitment and selection process that identifies academically talented
              computer science majors in need of financial assistance.

Provide the
              infrastructure support to handle 25 scholarship recipients per year. 

Define
              academic support and mentoring activities that will foster the retention of
              scholarship recipients.

Form alliances between the University and
              information technology employers and graduate schools to facilitate the
              placement of students.

Prepare a financial plan that demonstrates how
              program activities will be supported when grant funds are
              terminated.

Develop a comprehensive assessment plan to evaluate the
              effectiveness of planned activities.

The University is proud to be one of
              the largest predominantly black institutions in the nation and is recognized
              for the high quality of many of its academic programs. The institution has
              established a 'well-defined, current, and intellectually rigorous' course of
              study that has produced successful computer science graduates who compete
              favorably with their piers from other institutions in the job-market and
              graduate school. The University is confident that these efforts can be enhanced
              considerably if additional funding is provided to implement the proposed
              project.
