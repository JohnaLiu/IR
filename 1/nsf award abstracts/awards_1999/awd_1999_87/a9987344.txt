              Bodenheimer, Peter
"Evolution of Protostellar Planets"
AST-9987417

Dr.
              Bodenheimer continues his investigation of the development and evolution of
              protostellar condensations and disks.  Particular emphasis will be placed on
              the development of protoplanets and their role in moderating the later stages
              of protostellar disks.  The results will directly contribute to a better
              understanding of how the solar system formed, and the most likely formation
              scenarios for the wide assortment of newly discovered extrasolar
              planets.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Stellar
              Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
