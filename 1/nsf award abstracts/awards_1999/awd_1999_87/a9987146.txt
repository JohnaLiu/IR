Abstract    :
              A collaborative effort by the Computer Science Department, the Mathematics
              Department, and the School of Engineering at San Francisco State University
              provides scholarships for its needy students. The MESA Engineering Program at
              SFSU provides administrative and managerial services for this scholarship
              program. The Cooperative Education Program and the MESA Engineering Program
              both provide major support services to the recipients of these scholarships.
              

With its large enrollment of low-income and minority students and its
              location in one of the leading high-tech areas of the country, San Francisco
              State University offers an unusual opportunity to encourage talented students
              from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in computer science,
              engineering, and mathematics. San Francisco's Multimedia Gulch and nearby
              Silicon Valley offer numerous examples of the value of high-quality education
              in these fields. 

For financial reasons, almost all SFSU students must work
              part-time. The easy availability of jobs in Multimedia Gulch, Silicon Valley,
              and the other high-tech sectors of the Bay Area economy pull students out of
              school for too many hours per week. This delays students' academic progress and
              reduces the availability of the qualified professionals that are in great
              demand in local industry. 

These scholarships are directed to talented but
              financially needy students who will agree to use the scholarship funds to free
              up extra time for academic work. By reducing the necessity for students to
              perform nonrelevant work and by increasing their study time, this program will
              help many highly qualified students complete their education.
