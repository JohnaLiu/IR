Moffett, Thomas
"Collaborative Project:  Observations of Cepheids
              in Local Group Galaxies"
AST-9987347

This is a collaborative project to
              obtain radial velocity curves and abundance determinations for Cepheid variable
              stars in the galaxies M31 and M33.  Cepheid variable stars provide the primary
              means for determining the extragalactic distance scale.  This project will test
              the assumption that Cepheids outside our own Milky Way Galaxy and its
              satellites the Magellanic Clouds follow the same period-luminosity-abundance
              relation.  Candidates will be gleaned from the DIRECT photometry survey of
              nearby galaxies.  The spectroscopic observations of candidates will be
              performed with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope at McDonald Observatory.  The results
              will provide one of the first direct calibrations of distances in the Local
              Group of galaxies, and help refine the extragalactic distance scale upon which
              the determination of the Hubble constant depends.
Funding for this project was
              provided by the NSF program for Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA).
