Abstract    :
              (99),(32),(31),(21) The Computer Engineering/Computer Science and Mathematics
              NSF Scholars Program is a multi-component approach to improving retention and
              graduation rates, preparing students for higher education or the workplace, and
              strengthening ties with industry partners of the Department of Computer
              Engineering and Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics.  The
              university setting is a notably diverse, urban community that attracts large
              numbers of students from groups traditionally under represented in CSEMS
              fields. The CECS&M NSF Scholars Program is working in synergy with campus-wide
              efforts to improve retention and graduation. Through the Program, the
              Departments of CECS and Mathematics are reaching their goals by: (1) providing
              outreach to low-income, academically talented full-time students who are likely
              to complete their degrees in CECS or Mathematics within two years; (2)
              providing NSF scholarships for qualified students; (3) forming the NSF Scholars
              Program within the participating departments as a learning community to promote
              retention and graduation; (4) providing personalized mentoring and curriculum
              advising; (5) providing tutoring from honor society members, including
              participation in the Learning Assistance and Math Tutorial Centers; (6)
              providing assistance with placement of NSF Scholars in internships and co-ops;
              (7) providing mid- and end-of-semester tracking of NSF Scholars for progress to
              degree; and (8) providing documentation of best practices to promote successful
              retention and graduation. Program outcomes are being documented and evaluated
              to determine best practices for achieving the Program goals.
