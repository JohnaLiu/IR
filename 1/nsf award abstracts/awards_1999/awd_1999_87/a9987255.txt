This project will supply shipboard scientific support
              equipment for the Research Vessels Revelle, Melville, and New Horizon operated
              by UCSD, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and dedicated to use in support of
              ocean science research.  The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
              conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such items
              as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of
              scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
              earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
              for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
              motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
              sites.  The Project Director, Robert Knox is fully qualified to direct this
              project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and
              installation of shipboard equipment.  This project will allow the institution
              to acquire Modern Intercom, Replace and Additional Winch Readouts, Overhaul
              Mobile Crane, Tungsten Welder, Air Compressor Upgrade, Magnetometer Winch, and
              Portable Traction
