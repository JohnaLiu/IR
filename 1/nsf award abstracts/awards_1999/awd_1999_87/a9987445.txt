Sustaining the
              Biodiversity Collections Infrastructure with the Specify Database management
              System


Summary

Worldwide, biological museums contain an estimated three
              billion specimens of animals and plants. This enormous information store, the
              result of 300+ years of biological exploration, documents the life of the
              planet. As natural communities diminish, specimen data documenting life's
              diversity have become increasingly valuable for research, education and
              resource management. However, these historical data are often inaccessible and
              poorly supported on locally-developed database systems.

The SPECIFY Software
              Project is a community development effort to design, implement and support
              sophisticated scientific data management and analysis tools for biocollections.
              With NSF support, "SPECIFY," a robust, multi-taxon
database application has
              been developed for the management of specimen information. 
In this award the
              project will be further developed  to: (1) sustain the momentum of the Project
              by keeping SPECIFY current with commercial software components, (2) extend
              SPECIFY into client-server and internet retrieval architectures, and (3)
              continue with helpdesk and programming support for user institutions.
              

SPECIFY 1.0 is available without cost at: http://www.usobi.org/specify with
              helpdesk support for collections institutions.
