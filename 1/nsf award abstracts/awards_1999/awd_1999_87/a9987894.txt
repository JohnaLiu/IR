              supports U.S. participants (invited speakers, postdoctoral researchers, and
              graduate students) in the workshop  "Dynamo and Dynamics, a Mathematical
              Challenge," held at the Institut d'Etudes Scientifiques de Cargese in Corsica,
              France on  August 21-26, 2000  and co-sponsored by NATO, NSF and the CNRS.  A
              major goal of the workshop is to relate theoretical developments in
              astrophysics, magnetohydrodynamics, and dynamical systems theory to recent
              numerical simulations and to laboratory experiments currently coming on
              line.

The onset and dynamics of a magnetic field sustained by the motion of
              an electrically conducting fluid (the dynamo problem) is one in which
              multidisciplinary expertise is essential to answer even the most basic
              questions. The aim of the workshop is to facilitate collaborative interaction
              among workers in three major research areas related to the dynamo problem: i)
              large scale simulations ii) nonlinear dynamics (bifurcations, chaos, and
              spatio-temporal data analysis) and iii) laboratory scale experiments.
