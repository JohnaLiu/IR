	Many physical systems can exhibit chaotic behavior.  Examples
              include:  oscillating chemical systems; lasers driven beyond their threshold of
              stability; fluids flowing in channels; blood flowing in
arteries; neurons
              sending signals; large coupled electrical systems; etc.  Chaotic behavior means
              briefly that the signals generated by such systems are deterministic
              (predictable), oscillating, and
not periodic.
	Before we can hope to reach a
              deep understanding
of chaotic behavior, we must be able to classify the
              different types of chaotic behavior that can exist.  Similar problems were
              faced,and
resolved, in the disciplines of Biology (e.g., Linneaus) and
              Chemistry (e.g., Mendeleef) by scientists who were able to organize a structure
              for their respective fields.  The Principle Investigator has begun the
              
classification scheme for physical systems which can exhibit chaotic behavior
              by creating a classification scheme for all low dimensional chaotic dynamical
              systems.  He also described in detail how the information necessary to classify
              such systems can be extracted
from experimental data (R. Gilmore, Topological
              analysis of chaotic dynamical systems, Reviews of Modern Physics 70(4),
              1455-1530 (1998)).  He will extend this classification scheme to higher
              dimensional dynamical systems under the current grant.
