Abstract    :
              This project enables economically disadvantaged students to successfully
              complete any one of six different Associate Degree programs, (including
              Computer Systems Engineering Technology, Mechanical Engineering Technology,
              Telecommunications Technology, Computer Information Technologies, and
              Engineering and Computer Science Transfer), and secure employment or placement
              into four-year engineering or computer science programs. The program is
              thoroughly integrated into a tech prep consortium, a partnership between 11
              area secondary schools and the college, as well as linked to a neighboring 
              consortium, which includes eleven additional secondary schools. A
              well-established network of tech prep guidance counselors and site coordinators
              assists in promoting the program and recruiting applicants. On-campus tech prep
              support services provide part of the infrastructure needed to ensure
              scholarship student success. A faculty mentor guides scholarship students
              throughout the year. This individual also collaborates with the college Career
              Services Office and local industry partners to develop multiple student
              internship opportunities in engineering/computer technology. The program
              provides a model for utilizing NSF scholarships as seed money for convincing
              corporate partners of the value of investing in promising students, a model
              that utilizes existing national networks such as Tech Prep and School to Work
              and that can be disseminated through the existing networks build through NSF
              funding.
