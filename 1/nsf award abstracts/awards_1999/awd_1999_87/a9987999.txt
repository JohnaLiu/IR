Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Drs. Nancy E. Levinger,
              Ellen R. Fisher and other members of the Chemistry Department at the Colorado
              State University in continuing a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
              site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002 30 undergraduate students will
              spend ten weeks each conducting summer research in organic, inorganic,
              materials synthesis, analytical, and theoretical chemistry under the
              supervision of Chemistry faculty. Participants will take part in a professional
              development program including: use of the library and the chemical literature, 
              and field trips to corporate laboratories.  Students will present an informal
              talk as well as a formal poster on their research. Students will achieve a
              realistic understanding of the demands of independent chemical research and
              gain self confidence in pursuing such studies.
