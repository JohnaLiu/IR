The 2000 Gordon Research Conference on Aqueous Corrosion is
              scheduled for July 23-27, 2000 at Colby Sawyer College in New London, NH.
              Presentations at the conference cover a wide range of corrosion-related topics,
              but all fall under the conference theme: 'Corrosion Research in the Next
              Millennium; Reliability and Lifetime Prediction.' The conference features 18
              invited lectures. The speakers include well-established and long-standing names
              in the field of corrosion, younger newcomers now making cutting-edge
              contributions, and scientists who are involved in corrosion research but not in
              the mainstream of the corrosion community. There are speakers from academia,
              national laboratories, and industry. Discussion leaders involve senior people
              with in-depth knowledge of the session topic that are experienced in the Gordon
              Research Conference format.  They have demonstrated ability to stimulate
              vigorous discussion of the key issues with broad audience participation. The
              demographic mix of speakers and discussion leaders reflect that of the
              worldwide community of people working in the field of
              corrosion.

Corrosion is not a new field, but it continues to be an area
              of extreme technological and economic importance, as well as scientific
              vitality. The annual cost of corrosion (as a percentage of the US GNP) has
              decreased as a result of a range of measures that has developed from our
              fundamental understanding of the field. Like many fields in the physical
              sciences, industrial funding for corrosion research has decreased as companies
              put more focus on short-term problems. However, the current funding for
              fundamental research in academia is quite strong, with vigorous activities
              existing in universities across the US and the rest of the world. New
              approaches using the latest in technology are being applied to long-standing
              problems, such as the replacement of chromates in corrosion-protective coatings
              with more effective and environmentally friendly alternatives. This vigor is
              reflected in the list of speakers invited to participate in this Gordon
              Research Conference.
