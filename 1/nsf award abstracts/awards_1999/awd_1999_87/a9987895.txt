Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to take selected undergraduate students, who have
              had limited or no opportunities for research, and provide them with a
              significant research experience that will stimulate their interest in
              mathematical and computational sciences to the point that they will react
              positively to the possibility of attending graduate school for further
              education and research in mathematics realted areas.  The project is selected
              to illustrate methods of research that will take the students progressively
              from the definition of the problem, though the statement of objectives,
              literature search, and the actual research, to the point of writing up their
              results and conclusions.

In this project, students will be given an
              opportunity to do research in the area of numerical algorithms for problems
              arising from different areas in science and engineering.  In particular,
              students will be involved in the design, analysis, and implementation of
              parallel numerical algorithms for the solution of large sparse linear systems,
              eigenvalue, least squares, optimization problems.  This research will involve
              investigating the current literature in these areas as well as the parallel
              architecturs that can be utilized for this project.  In the instructional phase
              of the project, students will also learn mathematical concepts in numerical
              linear algebra, message-passing interface (MPI) and C/C++ programming language
              with appropriate language extensions to provide a means of implementing the
              parallel numerical algorithms on parallel processors.
