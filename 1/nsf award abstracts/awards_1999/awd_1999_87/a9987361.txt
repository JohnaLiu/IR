The Center for High Angular Resolution
              Astronomy (CHARA) optical interferometer will be modified to accommodate a
              spectroscopic capability in wavebands R through H.  This
              interferometer/spectrometer will allow direct separation of the photospheric
              spectra of binaries with separatrons of 0.2 to 10 milli-arc seconds, including
              interacting binaries and will enable measurements of the physical properties of
              interacting binaries to compare with evolutionary models.  It is also proposed
              to observe a number of Be disks to begin the process of understanding the
              kinematics.

The current group delay tracking will be upgraded to fringe
              tracking which will provide the opportunity to do Fourier Transform Spectrosopy
              (FTS) in the visible bands.
