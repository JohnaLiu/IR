Abstract    :
              The Departments of Computer Science, and Mathematics and Statistics and the
              College of Engineering, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, joins the
              National Science Foundation's CSEM Scholarship Program to address: 1) the
              national shortage of engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists, and 2)
              the under-representation of women, minorities and persons with disabilities in
              those disciplines. 

The UMass plan will increase the number of baccalaureate
              degrees in CSEM fields by recruiting fifty students for program participation
              generally during their junior and senior years. Particular attention will be
              paid to the recruitment of women, minorities and persons with disabilities.
              Talented, low-income students will be recruited from the community college
              transfer population and from upper-class students who have a reasonable
              expectation of graduating within two years (40 total). The UMass plan also
              provides a pipeline for the future by funding ten economically disadvantaged
              freshmen through University resources. 

The goal of recruiting, retaining
              and graduating 50 students will be accomplished through a faculty- driven,
              comprehensive program based on current research and best practices combining 1)
              recruitment, 2) financial support, 3) a carefully designed required course, 4)
              a special seminar activity and 5) academic and personal support facilities.
              

All CSEMS program activities will be professionally evaluated.
