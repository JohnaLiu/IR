The University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB) continues operation
              of a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The REU Site is hosted
              by the Department of Physics at UAB and includes participation of faculty from
              Samford University and Tuskegee University.  Eleven undergraduate students are
              recruited every year for a ten-week summer research experience, with a student
              recruitment focus on women and underrepresented minorities. 

Student
              research projects include high-pressure materials research, diamond thin films
              growth and characterization, microelectronic materials, laser materials, gas
              phase and surface chemistry, and computer simulation of materials.  In addition
              to participating in individual research projects, REU students attend seminars
              on scientific communication, on ethics in research and on preparation for
              graduate examinations, as well as on-campus social
              activities.
