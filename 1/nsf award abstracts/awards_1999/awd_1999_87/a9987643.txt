Abstract    :
              Our visual abilities arise from the capacity of photoreceptor cells to transduce
              a photic stimulus into a neural response and to transmit this message to second
              order neurons.  Effective transmission of that message is, in turn, dependent
              on processes acting during development that orchestrate the formation of  the
              retinal circuitry.  However, relatively little is known about the developmental
              mechanisms responsible for establishing the precise connectivity of
              photoreceptor cells.  The present investigation will identify cellular and
              molecular mechanisms controlling the formation of photoreceptor connectivity in
              the developing ferret retina.  Preliminary data indicate that photoreceptor
              terminals initially grown beyond their normal targets in the outer plexiform
              layer and that the errant terminals are subsequently retracted as proper
              connections are formed.  This proposal will define the transitional morphology
              of photoreceptor terminals during the period of synapse elimination.  Moreover,
              cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling terminal outgrowth, target
              recognition, and synaptic connectivity will be identified using in vivo
              experimental manipulations and in vitro approaches.  These studies should
              clarify the mechanisms by which the changing circuitry associated with
              photoreceptors is established during development.
