Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to assess the relationship between student
              achievement in mathematics and science and the System Incentiative Program.  We
              hope to accomplish this through a variety of means.  First, we will analyze the
              existing data made available to the NSF from local SI sites both by itself and
              relative to other national data sets.  Second, we will employ two pilot data
              analyses to access the fasibility of comparing local test results to a national
              reference scale of science and math performance (the NAEP).  Finally, we will
              disseminate our findings to the NSF, participating units (such as schools and
              school districts) and the general public.
