Abstract    :
              This project will be focused on enhancement and upgrading the California State
              University, Chico herbarium comprising approximately 58,000 vascular plant
              specimens and 13,000 bryophyte, lichen, and myxomycete specimens.  The
              objectives will be to repair existing specimens, move and conserve specimens
              into archival quality conditions, improve collections space, and increase
              accessibility of specimens and data.  The herbarium is the primary repository
              for collections from the vernal pools region of northern California, the
              southern Cascade Mountains, northern Sierra Nevada, inner North Coast Ranges,
              and Modoc Plateau.  The collections are historically important, dating back to
              the days of the California Republic, and are well-documented by ancillary
              information.
