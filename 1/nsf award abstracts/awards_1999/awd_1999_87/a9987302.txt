Abstract    :
              The general goals of the proposed research are to optimize a novel new genetic
              transformation technique.  A model organism the evolutionarily ancient and
              commercially valuable, edible red seaweed Porphyra, commonly known as nori has
              been selected for experimentation.  The specific goals of this SGER are:  1) to
              test an homologous promoter for stable gene expression of GUS and GFP reporter
              genes, and 2) to test and evaluate a number of genes for antibiotic resistance
              as selectable markers.

Over the past decade, genetic transformation
              techniques have made immeasurable contributions to agriculture and to an
              understanding of gene structure and function in land plants.  By comparison,
              the application of genetic transformation techniques to marine plants is in its
              infancy.  Despite the considerable commercial value of seaweed aquaculture, to
              date only a handful of unicellular marine algae and not a single macroscopic
              marine alga (or seaweed) have been transformed successfully.  The development
              of a genetic transformation procedure that is broadly applicable to marine
              algae would be extremely beneficial for developing new commercial uses for
              marine algae, as well as for furthering investigations of their molecular
              biology and biochemistry.
