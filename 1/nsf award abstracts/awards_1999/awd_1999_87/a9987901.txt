Abstract    :
              The Summer Institute in Mathematics for Undergraduates (SIMU) at the University
              of Puerto Rico -- Humacao is a six-week research program in the mathematical
              sciences.  The program is co-directed by Principal Investigator Professor
              Ivelisse Rubio, University of Puerto Rico - Humacao, and Co-Principal
              Investigator Professor Herbert A. Medina, Loyola Marymount University.  In
              addition, each summer two faculty members serve as seminar leaders and research
              directors for SIMU.  In summer 2000, these faculty are Reinhard Laubenbacher,
              New Mexico State University, and Victor Moll, Tulane University.  Twenty-four
              undergraduate students will participate each year in SIMU from 2000 - 2002. 
              Each year, half of the students will be women.

The program is designed for
              talented Latino and Native American---these are the populations served by the
              Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS),
              an organization with which the programs has close ties---undergraduates who
              want to engage in undergraduate mathematics research.  During SIMU students
              will complete an undergraduate research project in an active area of
              mathematics.  The mathematical areas in which students will work in summer 2000
              are computational algebra and integration of rational functions.  Students will
              present their research at an end-of-program colloquium series and write a
              technical report on their work.  After SIMU, students will present their
              research in academic conferences such as the annual SACNAS Conference and the
              Joint Mathematics Meetings.

The goal of SIMU is to increase the number of
              Latinos and Native Americans earning graduate degrees and pursuing research
              careers in the mathematical sciences.  Professor's Rubio and Medina believe
              that providing SIMU participants a rich and intensive research experience in an
              active area of mathematics is an excellent method for motivating and preparing
              students for graduate programs and careers in the mathematical sciences.
