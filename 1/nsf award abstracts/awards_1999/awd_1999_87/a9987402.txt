Polymer processing
              involves a complex interaction between material property variations and fluid
              dynamical phenomena.  The PI will pursue challenging extensions to his
              pioneering work on the description of long chain polymer behavior in
              representative flow fields.  Specifically, he will consider the effect of
              adsorption at the solid boundaries of the subject flow field.  Significant
              contributions, to the field of polymer processing, are expected from this
              research.
