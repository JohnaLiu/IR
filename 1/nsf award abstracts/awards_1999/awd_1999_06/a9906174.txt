Abstract    :
              The American Meterololgical Society (AMS), founded in 1919, is a scientific and
              professional body which promotes the development and dissemination of
              information of the atmospheric and related oceanic and hydrological sciences
              and the advancement of their professional applications.  Project ATMOSPHERE, is
              the AMS' comprehensive national program of teacher enhancement based on studies
              in the atmospheric sciences.  it is directed toward improving teacher
              effectiveness in generating interest and understanding in science, technology
              and mathematics among precollege students.  For number of years, the AMS
              Education Program has run an annual two-week workshop for Master Teachers of
              Atmospheric Sciences in coordination with the National Weather Service (NWS). 
              The program is held at the NWS Training Center in Kansas City, Missouri.  The
              purpose of the workshop is to provide learning experiences that focus on
              advances in observing, analyzing and forecasting weather, to examine ways in
              which the products of these can be employed in school studies of the
              atmospheric environment and prepare the trainees to conduct sessions in their
              home areas in the next school year.  This proposal is a request for partial
              support for a workshop for precollege teachers to be held in the summers of
              1999 and 2000.  The Division of Atmospheric Sciences has provided partial
              funding for this workshop in the past and the present award continues support
              of a slightly higher level for the summers of 1999 and 2000.
