Abstract    :
              The aim of the proposed doctoral dissertation research project is to explore how
              intergenerational transfers of wealth affect racial and ethnic inequality in
              assets between and within the Black, White and Hispanic communities in
              contemporary American society. The study builds on theories of social
              stratification and hypothesizes that inheritance of material resources is an
              increasingly important factor which determines racial and ethnic disparity in
              (1) ownership and magnitude of assets; (2) income generated from assets; and
              (3) transfers of inter-vivos gifts to children. Analyzing data from two
              national surveys, and applying different models to each of the racial/ethnic
              groups, two age cohorts will be closely studied: 1) the elderly who were born
              before the depression, and have experienced a prominent expansion in property
              ownership in the post World War II era; and 2) the 'baby-boomers' who, as a
              result of economic and demographic changes, are the most likely to be affected
              by intergenerational transfers of unprecedented amount of financial resources.
