Herrero-Bervera 

This award supports a three-year collaborative
              research project between Dr. Emilio Herrero-Bervera, of the School of Ocean and
              Earth Science and Technology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and Dr.
              Tesfaye Kidane, of the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the Addis Ababa
              University in Ethiopia.

The Afar Triangle, which lies at the junction of the
              Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Ethiopian rifts, has experienced some recent
              eruptions that have exposed thick sequences of lava flows.  There are few
              available lava records of younger (Plio-Pleistocene) field reversals from the
              African continent, and these lava flows have the potential of providing
              detailed records of those reversals.  The researchers will collect samples in
              the Gamarri section in the Central Afar Depression for their study of the
              paleointensity of the Reunion reversals.  They will also study the
              magnetostratigraphy of the Olduvai reversal recorded in the same section. The
              collaboration combines Dr. Herrero-Bervera's expertise in geomagnetism with Dr.
              Kidane's understanding of the volcanics of Ethiopia.

Results are expected to
              provide detailed records of the reversals that define the Reunion and Olduvai
              normal polarity subchrons.  This new information will be a significant
              contribution to the current knowledge about paleointensity over geologic
              time.

The Division of International Programs and the Division of Earth
              Sciences are jointly providing funding for this project.
