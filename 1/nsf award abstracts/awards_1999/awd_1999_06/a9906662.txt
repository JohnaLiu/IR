Abstract

	Following the complete sequencing of the genome, the
              next challenge will be to describe the repertoire of proteins synthesized by
              specific cell types under specific circumstances, i.e. proteome analysis.  Such
              study will require development of analytical methodology capable of addressing
              very complex mixtures of proteins.  The proposed work is directed toward
              development of such methodology using an integrated microfluidics (microchip)
              system employing three orthogonal separation/analysis modes (isoelectric
              focusing, partition chromatography and mass spectrometry)  followed by computer
              analysis of the resulting data.  The proposed system will be capable of
              identification of proteins in complex mixtures, including post-translationally
              modified proteins and definition of quantitative differences between protein
              mixtures.  The prototype of the proposed system will be implemented using
              recently developed soft-lithography techniques.
