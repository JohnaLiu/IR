The objectives of the project are twofold: 1) to study the
              structural and electrical properties of ion doped BaSrTiO (BSTO) thin films,
              and 2) to develop suitable capacitors based on BSTO material for DRAM
              applications.  Ion implantation is used to dope polycrystalline BSTO thin
              films.  Structural characterization of the implanted films is done by using
              X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.  Doping profiles will
              be simulated with the program TRansport of Ions in Matter and the implanted
              profiles characterized by secondary ion mass spectroscopy.  The effects of ion
              site substitution in the AB03 perovskite lattice is studied.  A comprehensive
              investigation into the electrical properties of donor and acceptor doped BSTO
              thin films is carried out with an emphasis on interface vs bulk doping effects.
               Electrical properties to be characterized include leakage, dielectric
              relaxation, capacitance density, dielectric loss, resistance degradation,
              microwave capacitance, and C-V.  In addition to donor and acceptor dopants,
              isovalent dopants are also investigated.  Ion implantation could be used to
              adjust the Ti concentration in BSTO thin films.  Different capacitor structures
              are designed, fabricated, and tested for the DRAM specifications.  This project
              is expected to help not only in the understanding of the implant doping effects
              of perovskite oxide films, but also in the development advanced planar memory
              devices for the next generation microelectronics.
