Abstract    :
              This proposal describes a research program to investigate control problems for
              underactuated mechanical systems, that is for mechanical systems with fewer
              independent control variables than degrees of freedom.  We propose a
              mathematical model that provides a framework for (1) developing a conceptual
              synthesis for control of the many examples of underactuated mechanical systems
              that have been studied in the published literature and (2) constructing new
              control analysis and design tools that are specific for underactuated
              mechanical systems.  Our first research objective is to develop a synthesis or
              unification of the disparate results in the existing literature on control of
              underactuated mechanical systems, thereby providing new insights into the
              applicability of various nonlinear control approaches.  Our other research
              objective is to develop new nonlinear control results that are specific to the
              class of underactuated mechanical systems.  This research direction would build
              heavily on the successful results developed under our current NSF research
              grant (on supervisory and hybrid control of nonlinear systems) as well as on
              the relevant nonlinear control results developed by many of our research
              colleagues.  We identify specific research directions that we believe are
              likely to be successful and we suggest that the expected results are likely to
              provide important advances beyond the existing knowledge base for control of
              underactuated mechanical systems.
