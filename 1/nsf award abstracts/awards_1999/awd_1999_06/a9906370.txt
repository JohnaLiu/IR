Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for a planning project to develop a network of
              ethnographers who study organizations that are substantial users of automated
              information technology.  In particular, the project focuses on organizations
              that use information technology to share and improve their understanding of
              relevant issues in order to meet their organizational goals (knowledge
              networking).  The project asks whether and how the creation of knowledge and
              its use may be changing in these technology intensive environments.  In the
              period of the award, the principal investigator will be recruiting
              ethnographers from various disciplines to participate in the network, by doing
              interviews, site visits, and presentations at professional meetings.  Working
              with an information consultant, the investigator will begin to develop an
              electronic information infrastructure to support the work of the participants
              and test the approaches that organizations are using. One or more workshops
              will be held, at which arrangements for the network and infrastructure will be
              discussed, and plans for a next-phase effort will be developed.
