This is a collaborative proposal with the Tulane University,
              University of Hawaii's Hawaii Mapping and Research Group (HMRG) and
              Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO).  In 1996, the National Science
              Foundation (NSF) funded scientists and engineers LDEO to design, fabricate, and
              construct a unique set of instruments for SCICEX missions.  The Seafloor
              Characterization and Mapping Pod (SCAMP) includes an Arctic optimized
              SeaMARC-type, Sidescan Swath Bathymetric Sonar (SSBS), a swept frequency or
              "chirp" High Resolution Subbottom Profiler (HRSP), a Bell BGM-3 gravimeter, and
              Data Acquisition And Quality Control System (DAQCS).  The Principal
              Investigators will install SCAMP, operate the underway geophysical
              instrumentation during the 1999 SCICEX cruise, remove the instrumentation from
              the USS Hawkbill after the cruise and reduce the data collected during the
              cruise.  Reduction of the data will be done by the Principal Investigator from
              HMRG.  The scientific part of the proposal is a geophysical study of the
              structure of the Lomonosov Ridge and the relationship between it and the
              Amerasian and Eurasian Basins.  It is speculated that the Lomonosov Ridge is a
              continental crustal structure and that it is the continental margin for both
              the Amerasian and Eurasian Basins.  The Principal Investigators will analyze
              the data collected during SCICEX99 to determine the structures developed during
              rifting, the nature of the ocean-continent boundary and variations in tectonic
              processes along the strike of the Lomonosov Ridge.
