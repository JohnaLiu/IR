Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to analyze the origins and development of
              informal dispute resolution and its relationship to the introduction and
              application of formal and statutory modes of arbitration. Both the law and
              public policy during the nineteenth century in England placed an increasing
              emphasis on the elaboration and implementation of arbitration as a means to
              resolve disputes, especially in the field of industrial relations. Based upon
              extensive research into local newspaper collections, trade union and employers'
              organizations archival material, parliamentary papers, and the private papers
              of local attorneys and barristers, this project seeks to reveal the wide
              variety of forms of arbitration during this period. Moreover, its analytical
              perspective will be derived from an interdisciplinary approach that merges
              legal history and theory with industrial relations theory. Consequently,
              emphasis will be placed upon the distinction between private and statutory
              legal system as well as the importance of rule-making and job regulation.
              Currently, in the wake of the burgeoning litigation crisis, there is a movement
              among attorneys and judges to employ alternative means of dispute resolution,
              particularly arbitration, and thereby alleviate the current congestion in the
              courts will be alleviated. By studying the history of arbitration, not only
              will earlier practices and precedents be uncovered but individual case studies
              will help to identify both the sources of arbitration's success and the causes
              of its failures.
