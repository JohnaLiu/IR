Abstract    :
              The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) administers the NSF
              Project Showcase for the National Science Foundation (NSF).  Held at the 1999
              ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, the NSF Project Showcase is an exhibition
              of research, products, and findings from projects that have been sponsored by
              the NSF's Division of Undergraduate Education and Division of Engineering
              Education and Centers.  Each of the approximately ten projects in the showcase
              is represented by its Principal Investigator.  A high profile placement in the
              exhibition hall will afford the Principal Investigators the best vantage point
              to interface with conference attendees.
