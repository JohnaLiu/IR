Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the chemistry of organic compounds of sulfur and
              selenium.  Broad studies of the chemical and physical properties of a variety
              of S- and Se-heterocycles will be carried out.  Specific methodological studies
              include those directed toward the development of polyfunctional sulfonylethenes
              for use as cumulene equivalents in Diels-Alder reactions.  Several interesting
              natural products are targeted for total synthesis to explore issues surrounding
              the manipulation of compounds containing multiple sulfur-based functional
              groups.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              continues its support for the research of Professor Eric Block of the State
              University of New York at Albany.  Professor Block explores the chemistry of
              organic molecules containing sulfur and selenium atoms.  Such molecules can be
              used to modify the structures of other organic compounds and are also found in
              nature.  Further study of novel forms of these molecules will uncover new and
              useful reactions and reagents.  Several naturally occuring compounds will be
              synthesized in order to learn more about how to carry out reactions on
              molecules that may have more than one sulfur atom.
