Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is the study and development of novel
              organometallic chemistry using highly reactive metals.  Theoretical and
              mechanistic studies will be undertaken in addition to synthetic methods
              development.  Of particular interest is the development of selective
              metallation reactions using a variety of highly reactive metals including Zn,
              Mn, Ni, and Cu.  The types of selectivities that are being developed include
              substrate selectivity according to degree substitution at halogen, as well as
              functional group tolerance during metallation.  Reactions in which oxygenated
              functional groups act analogously to halogens are also anticipated, providing
              additional flexibility in the design of organometal-based reaction
              schemes.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              continues support for the research of Professor Reuben D. Reike of the
              University of Nebraska.  Professor Reike leads an ongoing effort to discover
              new ways to incorporate metal atoms into the structure of otherwise purely
              organic molecules.  These organometallic species hold an indispensible place in
              the arsenal of synthetic organic chemists because they can be used in a variety
              of reactions that quickly increase the size and complexity of the resulting
              molecule.
