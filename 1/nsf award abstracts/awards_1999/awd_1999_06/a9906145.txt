The project investigates socioeconomic status (SES)
              differences in mortality in the United States.  Little is know about how some
              dimensions of SES-such as different sources of income and, importantly, the
              accumulation of assets-influence mortality risks.  The principal purpose of
              this research is to develop an improved understanding of the linkage between
              income, assets, and cause-specific adult mortality that also takes into account
              the varied race/ethnic composition of the population.    The specific aims of
              the study are to: (1) assemble an integral, prospective database that will
              allow us to simultaneously examine the effects of a more comprehensive set of
              income and asset variables on U.S. cause-specific adult mortality than has
              heretofore been the case, (2) test whether the effects of family income on
              adult mortality risk depend upon the type of income received, (3) examine
              whether the ownership of material assets, an important but often overlooked
              dimension of SES, influences mortality risks, even above and beyond the
              influences of family income, and (4) test whether family income and asset
              variables interact with race/ethnicity-non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic blacks,
              Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, Puerto Rican Americans, and Asian
              Americans-to affect the risk of mortality.  

A database has been created
              from pooled information (five years of data) from the Family Resource
              Supplements (FRS) of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), matched to
              death information from the National Death Index (NDI). The resultant dataset
              containing pooled information from the two surveys is the newest available
              source with national data that allows for detailed analysis of economic
              differences in cause-specific mortality.
