Funds are being transferred to the Office of the Chief
              Scientist at NOAA to cost-share certain activities associated with the
              development of a Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). 
Oceanographers have
              long recognized the value of an ongoing operational observing system that would
              provide fundamental measurements to meet the observational needs of many user
              communities.  Over the past several years, several international organizations
              have worked together to initiate plans for such an observational system. 
              Agreements have been reached by several governmental organizations to jointly
              sponsor a GOOS program.  A fully implemented GOOS will satisfy ocean observing
              requirements for climate monitoring, assessment and prediction, for monitoring
              and assessment of marine living resources, and of the health of the ocean, for
              monitoring the coastal zone environment and its changes, and for meteorological
              and oceanographic operational services.
