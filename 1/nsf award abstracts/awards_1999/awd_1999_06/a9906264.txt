Abstract    :
                 Much of what engineers do improves the quality of life, but descriptions of
              engineering programs generally fail to show a human side that would be of
              interest to women.  The purpose of the proposed project is to plan a 3-year
              program to (1) prepare materials and develop programs for recruiting women into
              engineering programs by emphasizing the human side of engineering, (2)
              implement the recruiting programs, (3) develop student-centered collaborative
              projects that focus on the human side of engineering and hopefully encourage
              women to stay involved in the engineering curriculum, and (4) organize and
              conduct the inaugural multi-institution collaboration.
   Planning for this
              program will involve 4-year engineering and technology schools as well as
              selected high schools throughout Ohio.  Groups of women students prepared for
              engineering school, and ranging from high school juniors to college sophomores
              will be interviewed to identify themes, media, and messengers that would be
              most useful in recruiting women engineering students.  University faculty and
              industry representatives willing to help define and support collaborative
              projects for engineering students will be identified.
