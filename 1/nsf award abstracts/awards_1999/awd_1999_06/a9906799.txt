Abstract    :
              A comprehensive documentation and study of a selected group of highly
              siderophile and chalcophile elements in mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) glasses
              from the URI dredge rock collection will be conducted,  with emphasis on
              relative fractionations and systematic geographical variations. The URI dredged
              rock collection has focused on unusually elevated mid-ocean ridge  affected by
              nearby hotspots and underlying mantle plumes.  So far, PGE contents in MORB
              reported in the literature have been very limited and not very systematic,
              primarily due to their very low abundances and resulting analytical
              difficulties.  The use of high resolution, high sensitivity, inductive
              plasma-mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS)  is providing new analytical
              opportunities.  An isotopic dilution / HR-ICP-MS method of analysis for Ir, Ru,
              Pt , Pd, Re, Ag, Cd, and Te will be developed and tested initially, and
              followed by analyses of a large number of MORB glasses.  The same glasses will
              also be analyzed for S (with the electron microprobe) and Se (by radiochemical
              neutron activation analysis).  The focus will be on delineating the full range
              of siderophile/chalcophile element variations of MORBs, their relative
              fractionation and seek possible correlations, or decoupling, between these
              elements and the Pb, Sr, Nd, and He isotope systems, S, Se and Te, and other
              geochemical parameters previously established on the very same basalt glasses.
              The purpose is to gain new and greater insights in our understanding of  the
              PGE content of the oceanic crust and underlying mantle, length-scales of mantle
              heterogeneities in PGE, melting conditions, sources of mantle plumes and mantle
              dynamics.
