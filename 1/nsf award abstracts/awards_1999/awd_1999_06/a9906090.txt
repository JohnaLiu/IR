Abstract    :
              The proposal from Texas Tech seeks partial support of a DS-3 connection to the
              gigaPoP at Texas A&M University's (TAMU) Houston Institute of Biosciences and
              Technology (IBT). Applications proposed include IP multicasting, both
              point-to-point and multicast, to be used in facilitating collaboration,
              seminars and presentation of course materials focused on areas such as
              biocybernetics and bioinformatics. Other applications include simulations of
              human movement systems with specific application to solving problems of vision
              and human gait; retrieval of real-time and archived data sets used in
              developing innovative multimedia applications for accessing and analyzing
              meteorological data and precision agriculture.  Support of system-level
              experiments on the active and passive components for Dense Wavelength Division
              Multiplexing (WDM) is another intended use of the vBNS. Collaborating
              institutions include but are not limited to: the University of Chicago,
              Washington University at St. Louis, Johns Hopkins University, University of
              Notre Dame, University of Washington, Texas A&M, University of
              California-Davis, DARPA, the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, and the
              National Library of Medicine.
