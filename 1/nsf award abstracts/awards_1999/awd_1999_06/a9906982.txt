              will gather data and develop a report to the field on mathematics activities in
              science museums.  The purpose of the Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              (SGER) grant is to support initial research on the current status of
              mathematics in science museums, to document exemplary models for the field, and
              to determine the feasibility of a mathematics initiative for science museums
              and their client schools.  The final product, a document similar to the
              NSF-funded publication "First Hand Learning," will serve the field as well as
              the education community in seeking better approaches for improving mathematics
              education.
