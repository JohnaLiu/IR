Abstract    :
                This proposal is a continuation of the research supported by NSF Grant
              ECS-9627849.  The objective is to study the modeling, mathematical analysis,
              and in particular novel, reliable and efficient numerical methods for
              semiconductor device simulations.  The emphasis of the proposed effort will be
              on the analysis and simulation of the recently developed high field (HF) models
              without and with energy transport, the hydroynamic (HD) models, the kinetic
              models, the energy transport, (ET)  models, the quantum related models, and
              optoelectronic device models involving the coupling with the Maxwell equations.
               Both time accurate models and numerical methods and steady state solutions
              will be considered.  Collaborations and communications with device physicists,
              engineers, and applied mathematicians, will be maintained, to investigate
              device simulation problems from physical, mathematical, and numerical points of
              view.
