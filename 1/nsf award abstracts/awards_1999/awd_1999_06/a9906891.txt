The recommended proposal is
              for a marine geological field program in the Lima Basin of the Peruvian margin
              to examine the dynamics of gas hydrate formation, by modeling and testing the
              relationship between vertical tectonic activity and the stability of gas
              hydrate and related development of bottom-simulating reflectors (BSR's).  The
              work integrates seismic data, inferred stratigraphic relationships and
              subsidence, sedimentation, and erosion rates, and numerical modeling techniques
              in this area of high sediment fluid flux, high organic productivity, and active
              vertical tectonism.  These characteristics place the Peruvian margin as an
              end-member in continental margins with documented hydrate and BSR occurrence. 
              The research will serve as a baseline for the proposed Peruvian Margin drilling
              (ODP drilling proposal 355-Full 7).  The field program will occur aboard two
              R/V Sonne cruises in 2000, and will consist of "piggyback" ocean bottom
              seismometer work involving the deployment of German ocean-bottom seismometers. 
              The proposed work will provide a test of the hypothesis that vertical tectonics
              may suppress the formation of gas hydrates, with a subsequent lack of BSR
              formation.
