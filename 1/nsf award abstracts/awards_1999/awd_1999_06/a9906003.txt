Abstract    :
              The proposed exploratory research will attempt to couple a
              thickness-distribution model of sea ice with vertical temperature resolution to
              the NCAR CSM. An ice thickness distribution model resolves multiple thickness
              categories on the sub-grid scale and allows an explicit treatment of ice
              deformation. Inclusion of an ice thickness-distribution model and vertical
              temperature resolution in the ice affects ice growth and decay as well as the
              exchange of heat and moisture between atmosphere and ocean. These processes
              influence the mean state and sensitivity of high latitude climate. The
              thickness distribution model uniquely resolves a vertical temperature profile
              in the sea ice while strictly conserving energy and can be integrated with
              fewer categories than traditional methods. The work is important because it
              will result in an improved sea ice model in the CSM, one that uses more
              realistic thermodynamics.
