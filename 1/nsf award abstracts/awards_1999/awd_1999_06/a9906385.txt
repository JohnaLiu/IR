Title: Grande Pile
              Time Scale

This SGER award supports the development of a detailed
              chronometry of the Grande Pile pollen record in the Interval of the
              interglacial at an annual to decadal time scale.  For this purpose modern
              analytic methods available will be utilized which include an image processing
              technique, previously tested on a few samples taken from the Grande Pile core,
              which is available at LDEO.  This study has two objectives: 
(1) To further
              improve a method, which would enable relatively fast, machine assisted recovery
              of annual to decadal signatures in diatomic sediments; (2) Determine the
              duration of the Eemian interglacial.
