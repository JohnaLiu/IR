Abstract    :
                 The Mid-continent Regional Educational Laboratory (McREL) proposes a planning
              grant to develop a Large Collaborative proposal, the Women Exploring Learning
              through Creative Opportunities for Meaningful Education (W.E.L.C.O.M.E.)
              Project, addressing the educational and technological needs of young women
              students transitioning from Middle School to High School in the states of North
              Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.  This planning grant, in collaboration with
              Girls Count, Inc., and the U.S. Department of Education Region VIII Equity
              Center at Metropolitan State College of Denver, is intended to provide an
              opportunity to clarify issues associated with submitting the W.E.L.C.O.M.E.
              Large Collaborative proposal.  The objectives of the W.E.L.C.O.M.E. Planning
              Grant are:
o Conduct a detailed study of existing research and best practices
              which will determine appropriate and              necessary content in the
              design of the W.E.L.C.O.M.E. project;
o Conduct a detailed study to determine
              need and utility of a summer camp approach;
o Determine the feasibility of
              establishing and conducting a summer camp experience for middle school girls   
               and their teachers in North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming;
o Identify and
              secure support from other partners in each state;
o Determine strategic
              locations to conduct summer camp experience;
o Refine curriculum, data
              gathering processes and instruction methodologies.
