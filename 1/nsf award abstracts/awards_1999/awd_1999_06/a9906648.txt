The award supports a national meeting of key leaders and
              educators in Earth and Space Science.  The meeting participants will be charged
              to develop an action plan for the establishment of a national digital library
              to support undergraduate education in Earth and Space Science.  The term
              "national digital library refers to both a collection of electronic materials,
              and the community based organization that manages the collection, develops new
              software tools, and provides consulting and training services to library users.
               This national digital library is recognized as the central organizing tool for
              dissemination and coordination of curricular materials and instructional
              methods, and for developing interfaces with primary data needed for effective
              inquiry based study of the Earth System.
