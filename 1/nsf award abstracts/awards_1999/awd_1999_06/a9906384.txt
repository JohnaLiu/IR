This three-year award for a U.S.-Netherlands research project in
              theoretical nuclear physics supports Dr. Chueng-Ryong Ji and a graduate student
              from North Carolina State University (NCSU) for collaboration with Dr. Bernard
              Louris Gerrit Bakker at Vrije University in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  The
              project addresses the connection between the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and
              the relativistic constituent quark model which can be used in various
              electroweak form factor calculations.  The project will identify the
              non-wave-function vertices, which are essential in the calculation of
              electroweak form factors in the time-like region, using the pointlike covariant
              vertices, and construct the non-wave-function model vertices describing
              extended objects.  The analysis will have immediate application to various
              semileptonic meson decay processes.  The project merges the expertise of the
              Vrije University group on the perturbative approach with the NCSU program on
              the light-front quark model approach.
