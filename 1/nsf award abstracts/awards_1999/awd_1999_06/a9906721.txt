This research is a collaboration between the Department of
              Natural Sciences at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, the Department of
              Geological and Environmental Sciences at Hope College, the Department of Civil
              and Environmental Engineering at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor and
              Clayton Environmental Consultants, Inc. of Novi, Michigan.  The project will
              investigate   "air sparging", a popular method of remediating groundwater and
              soil contaminated with volatile organic compounds.  Remediation effectiveness
              is largely determined by the location and geometry of subsurface airflow
              pathways, which in turn are controlled by site conditions, such as grain-size
              distribution and stratigraphic heterogeneity.  The research goals are 1: To
              quantitatively and qualitatively define the hydrogeologic parameters necessary
              for the successful use of air sparging in the remediation industry, 2: To
              develop a predictive model to facilitate its use at appropriate sites without
              the need for expensive and inconclusive pilot studies.  This will be
              accomplished by a tripartite approach of laboratory, computer modeling and
              field observation.  Laboratory observations will be used to validate and modify
              a multiphase-flow model (MISER), which in turn will be calibrated to a
              well-studied field site.  Undergraduate research students will participate, and
              project results and methodologies will be incorporated into environmental
              science and engineering curricula at Hope College and the University of
              Michigan.
