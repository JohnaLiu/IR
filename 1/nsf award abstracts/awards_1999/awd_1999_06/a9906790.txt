MEMS Algorithms and Systems for Distributed Manipulation

This is the
              first year funding of a three year continuing award. The proposed research
              focuses on algorithms and systems that enable MEMS to perform distributed
              manipulation tasks, taking on the challenge of design, control, and programming
              of massively-parallel arrays of microactuators. Arrays of MEMS devices can move
              and
position tiny parts, such as integrated circuit chips, in flexible and
              predictable ways by oscillatory or ciliary action. The theory of programmable
              force fields can model this action, leading to algorithms for powerful and
              general micromanipulation strategies. 
The proposed research will develop new
              algorithms and new MEMS systems for massively parallel distributed
              manipulation. This entails the design, fabrication, and control of new MEMS
              devices, together with the design, construction, and programming of new control
              systems, algorithms, and software for task-level manipulation. The PI's team
              will investigate algorithms and systems for part orientation, singulation,
              sorting, and posing. They will extend the theory of programmable vector fields,
              develop universal feeder-orienter devices, exploit sensor feedback, and
              investigate closed loop control algorithms, online algorithms, and distributed,
              local control of ciliary arrays. Finally, the PI's team will explore the
              application of massively parallel systems and force fields to structural
              biology and human augmentation.
