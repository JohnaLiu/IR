              Lien
A one-year analysis of Lagrangian measurements of Internal Waves and
              Turbulence in the Deep Cycle Layer in 
the Central Equatorial Pacific will be
              conducted. The goal is to quantify the properties of internal waves and
              
turbulence in the deep layer. Specific objectives are to: (1) separate
              internal waves and turbulence based on the observed Lagrangian frequency
              spectrum; (2) examine the diurnal fluctuation of velocity variances and the
              spectral evolution of internal waves; (3) examine the diurnal fluctuations of
              the turbulent inertial subrange; and (4) estimate the vertical heat flux from
              Lagrangian measurements of temperature and vertical velocity.
