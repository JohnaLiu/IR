Abstract    :
              This award is made under section B., Connections for Higher Education
              Institutions, within "Connections to the Internet", NSF 98-102. It provides
              partial support for South Dakota State University in partnership with the
              Capital University Center (CUC) to gain access to statewide network resources
              and the Internet. The Center's purpose is to bring college education to an area
              in the central part of the state where colleges and/or universities are over
              125 miles away. The work will be done in partnership with South Dakota State
              University (SDSU) who is the provider of delivery of courses and programs
              needed for workforce development and continuing education. Availability to the
              Internet will be provided to faculty, staff, and student members of this rural
              community.
