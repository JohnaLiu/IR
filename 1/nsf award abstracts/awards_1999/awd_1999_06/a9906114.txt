Abstract    :
                 The Women Working Technical (WomenTech) Project is being carried out by the
              Institute for Women in Trades, Technology & Science (IWITTS).  It aims to:  1)
              increase the recruitment and retention of women in SMET courses at three
              community college demonstration sites; 2) institutionalize gender equity
              strategies beyond the Project's life; and 3) illustrate to the community
              college system gender equity strategies that increase recruitment and retention
              of women in SMET courses.
   WomenTech is utilizing a National Advisory
              Committee to advise on development and dissemination of strategies.  Each demo
              site has a Leadership Team, whose advice and influence will ensure long-term
              institutionalization of project strategies.  IWITTS will conduct training on
              recruitment and retention of women in SMET courses and for the colleges'
              industry partners on successfully receiving women.  Women in SMET courses
              around the country will connect with each other through the WomenTech web site.
               IWITTS will disseminate successful strategies nationally -- through conference
              presentations and media coverage and by capitalizing on the advice and networks
              of Leadership Team and National Advisory Committee members.
   By increasing
              the number of women in SMET courses at the community college level, WomenTech
              will open wide the doors of opportunity for women in well-paying SMET
              technician careers.
