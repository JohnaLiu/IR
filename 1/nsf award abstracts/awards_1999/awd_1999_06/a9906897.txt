ABSTRACT

OCE-9906987

This work will investigate the cycling of nutrients
              in South Atlantic Bight (SAB) sediments, taking into consideration
              non-diffusive (i.e. advective, or current driven) transport between the pore
              water and overlying water as well as microalgal photosynthetic production in
              the sediment. The work will include examination of the processes that control
              pore water nutrient distributions and inventories, estimates of the benthic
              flux of nutrients, and estimates of the physically forced (non-diffusive) pore
              water exchange. The work will entail use of benthic chambers which will provide
              in-situ measurements of benthic flux, and a benthic peeper system which will
              provide measurements of sediment nutrient profiles.  The results for the SAB
              will be compared to measurements on the West Florida shelf.
