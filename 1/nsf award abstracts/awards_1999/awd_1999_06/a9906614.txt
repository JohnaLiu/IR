Abstract    :
              This instrumentation development award provides funds to develop a buoy-mounted
              instrument that is capable of measuring the rain water concentrations of
              dissolved Fe(II) and Fe(III) in an autonomous and real-time manner.  This data
              will allow scientists to quantify the wet deposition of iron in the oceans. 
              The proposed research is joint Dr. Robert Byrne at the University of South
              Florida, and involves coupling a long pathlength Liquid Core Waveguide
              absorbance spectrometer developed at USF to the buoy-mounted rainwater
              collector, aerosol sampler and meteorological sensors developed at WHOI. The
              system will be tested on shore and then on a buoy moored off Woods Hole, MA in
              the summer of 2000.
