This U.S.-Brazil award supports a planning visit by Dr.
              Richard G. Weiss and two students of Georgetown University, Washington D.C., 
              to meet with Dr. Teresa Atvars at the  Universidada Estadual de Campinas and
              Professor Ira Brinn at Universidade Federal de Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to
              develop collaborative research projects concerning the exploration of polymer
              properties using fluorescence techniques and the determination of the types and
              rates of photoinduced intramolecular proton transfer in
              2-hydroxyphenyl-lapazole.

Professor Atvars is a recognized expert in
              physical processes in polymers and Dr. Brinn's laboratory posses a
              state-of-the-art flash photolysis apparatus that could be modified easily to
              investigate transient species from guests in polymer films. The in-person
              presence of Dr. Weiss will allow equipment modification to be conceptualized
              and carried out to the satisfaction of all parities.   Additionally, during the
              planning visit the PI and students will utilize equipment not available at
              Georgetown to conduct some preliminary experiments in order to remove
              ambiguities that accompany a lack of direct observation. .  It will verify that
              the students/post docs from the two labs will be communicating in the same
              scientific language.
