The principal investigator proposes the
              acquisition of three component laser Doppler velocimeter.  The system will be
              used to measure the three velocity components in separated, buoyancy affected,
              convective flows.  The system will be used in conjunction with an existing
              liquid crystal thermography system for temperature measurements to
              simultaneously measure the flow field and the surface heat transfer
              coefficients from a heated constant flux surface as part of a coordinated
              experimental and numerical study of the flow and heat transfer in the separated
              and reattached flow regions in the three ddimensional geometry of a backward
              facing step.  The focus will be on determining the effect of the heat transfer
              and the buoyancy on the mean and fluctuating velocity components.  Reynolds
              shear stresses, normal stresses, and heat transfer coefficients will be
              determined.

The three component LDV will be the ony one in the four campus
              University of Missouri system and the State of Missouri and will be available
              to other faculty involved in fluid mechanics research.
