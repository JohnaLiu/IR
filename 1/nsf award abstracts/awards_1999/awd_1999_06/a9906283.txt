Abstract    :
              
Demolishing of prestressed concrete is difficult due to the energy stored
in
              the prestressing metal tendons which is usually up to 125,000 pounds.
              In
unbonded tendons the energy may be catastrophically released,
              threatening
the safety of people, workers and buildings. Most of all flat
              plate
construction and bridge girders produced utilize tensioning of
              metal
tendons; so the problem is large and it most improtantly it is
              unresolved. 

The objectives of this research are to develop and to test
              means of
restraining or rebonding the tendons under stress for continued
              effective
load transfer during use and for safe demolition.  The proposed
              research
approach consists of four activities. 1) We will develop information
              on the
forces available in prestressed members and calculate the
              countervailing
forces needed to be supplied by the release mechanism and
              materials. 2)
Large scale laboratory testing will be done on the proposed
              systems.
Strucutral tie downs and tensioning devices will be used. 3) Full
              scale
prestressed girders will be tested using the rebonding system. 4) the
              data
will be evaluated and disseminated.

The impact on education should be
              large. This project should employ an
estimated 25-30 different students from
              both undergraduate and graduate
levels. They will be active in all aspects of
              the project. The proportion
of women gaining that experience should be high,
              approximately half or more.
