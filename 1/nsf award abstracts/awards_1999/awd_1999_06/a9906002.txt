Abstract    :
              This project seeks to produce a high-resolution pollen record of climatic and
              vegetational changes during the last 25,000 years from the Sajama ice cap in
              the Altiplano of Bolivia.  Pollen preserved in ice cores retrieved from the
              Sajama ice cap will be analyzed at annual to decadal sampling resolutions to
              detect the response of the tropical Andean vegetation to century-scale climatic
              fluctuations occurring during the late-Holocene, such as the Little Ice Age,
              the Medieval Warm Period, and the regional drought events that episodically
              lowered the water levels in Lake Titicaca during the last 3500 years.  The
              pollen data will also complement other paleoclimatic proxies to shed light on
              the vegetational response to abrupt climatic changes occurring during the Last
              Glacial Maximum and deglacial times, including a deglaciation climatic reversal
              about 14,000 to 11,500 years ago that is correlative with the North Atlantic
              Younger Dryas stadial.

This research will be the first systematic pollen
              study of a tropical ice core.  It will advance the field of ice-core palynology
              and will enhance the use of pollen as a paleoclimatic and paleoecological proxy
              in ice-core research.  The 25,000-year pollen record from the Sajama ice cap
              will add to only one other continuous pollen record from the entire tropical
              Andes and western Amazonia south of the equator that contains information
              pertaining to the vegetation and climatic conditions of the Last Glacial
              Maximum.  It will offer a unique opportunity to study the sensitivity of the
              tropical Andean vegetation to past and future climatic changes.
