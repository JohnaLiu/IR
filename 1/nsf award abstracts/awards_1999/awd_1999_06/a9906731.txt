Abstract    :
              Polzin/Kunze

A study of finescale internal wave shear and strain
              climatologies using the 
Lowered Acoustic Doppler Profiler and hydrographic
              profiles from the World 
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) will be
              conducted. The finescale spectral 
levels will be quantified on a section by
              section basis and as a function of 
topographic variability, barotropic tidal
              flows and low frequency currents. A 
finescale parameterization for turbulence
              based upon internal wave-wave 
interaction theory will be used to assess
              dissipation rates and eddy diffusivities. 
The goal is to provide estimates of
              diapycnal mixing in abyssal basins.
