Abstract    :
              

The proposed research is a renewal of a program under a prior NSF award
              ECS-9634268 entitled, "Nonlinear Optics in Single Crystal Microstructure of
              Organic Materials". Under this grant, the PI has succeeded in making the single
              crystal organic films using the "shear method" he developed.  He has achieved
              various organic films with fairly large size (>2 cm2).  Measurements made on
              these materials have shown large second order susceptibilities for the films.
              The electro-optic coefficients of these films also show somewhat larger values
              than that of lithium niobate.  As a result he has demonstrated a single-pass
              elecro-optic modulator with a modulation depth of 20% using a 3-micron thick
              single crystal film of DAST at low ac field (1V/um at 4 kHz). The proposed
              renewal program is for a period of 12 months. Work includes continuation of the
              development of the single crystal film to achieve large second and third order
              optical nonlinearities, performing detailed optical measurements over a wide
              wavelength range, and demonstration of high-speed EO modulator
              performance.
