Abstract    :
              The PI will develop a rapid and inexpensive radiometric (K/Ar) method for
              determining the age of marine clay minerals for provenance tracer studies in a
              range of geological and oceanographic applications.  The method will be applied
              to a suite of samples from the North Pacific and the Bay of Bengal to study the
              provenance of dust and riverine sediments, respectively.  One outcome of the
              study may be the development of a routine low cost Argon dating method for ODP
              samples.
