Abstract    :
              With support from the National Science Foundation's Innovation and
              Organizational Change Program, this research focuses on whether and how the
              diffusion of educational innovation can occur in chemistry departments and
              their institutions. It examines the results of two inter-liked chemistry
              consortia (ChemLinks and ModularChem) whose participating faculty represent a
              wide array of two-year and four-year institutions.  The number of faculty
              adapting the consortia's teaching materials and methods continues to grow via
              workshop dissemination and informal "networking' by the original participants,
              and the number of participating institutions is now approximately one hundred.
              

The central purposes of this analysis are to clarify the conditions that
              enable or limit change in higher education in the sciences, and to evaluate the
              efficacy of the theories of  change implicit in the chemistry consortia's
              strategies and in the NSF programs to which they are a response. 

The
              results of this project will aid in our understanding of what does, and does
              not, promote and sustain improvement is student learning, faculty classroom
              practice, departmental performance and institutional support for improvements
              in education.
