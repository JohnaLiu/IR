Abstract    :
              This research program is primarily a theory oriented study of waves in the
              magnetosheath and on the surface of the magnetopause.  The program will also
              examine the role similar MHD waves play in coronal heating on the sun.  The
              approach used will be primarily theoretical studies of MHD wave activity, and
              in particular the emphasis will be on Kinetic Alfven waves (KAW).  The
              theoretical results will be compared with observed wave amplitudes and
              polarizations as a function of magnetic shear and magnetic field gradients.
