This Symposium at the Fall 1999 Meeting of the American
              Chemical Society is
titled "Teaching Polymers at All Levels: Kindergarten to
              Graduate School".
It aims to bring together educators from different
              backgrounds to discuss
ways to enhance the teaching and appreciation of
              polymers.  The topics of
the talks will cover the spectrum of approaches from
              curricular innovation
and development to distance learning, web-based
              approaches, informal
education, museum-centered activities, and student
              kits.
