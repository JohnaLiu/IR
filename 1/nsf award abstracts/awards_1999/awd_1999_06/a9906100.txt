Abstract    :
              
This study proposes to investigate high-frequency drought events in
              northwestern Montana for two time intervals: 0-2000 and 7000-9000 14C yr BP. 
              The principal goals are to reconstruct the timing, severity, and cyclicities of
              shifts in effective moisture so that we may address the following questions: 1)
              Are drought frequencies correlative in time with known solar and/or
              oceanic-atmospheric frequencies? 2) Does the frequency of drought change over
              the last 10 ka BP and are these changes correlative with changes in the
              climatic boundary conditions? 3) Does the timing of drought in the Northwest
              have a defined relationship to that of adjacent regions?
Three climatic
              proxies preserved in lake sediments-- the d18O of carbonates, diatom
              assemblages, and charcoal-will be used to answer these questions.  The combined
              use of d18O and diatoms potentially provides an innovative technique for
              estimating the severity, as well as the seasonal timing of drought.  The
              addition of charcoal analyses permits the study the effects of drought on both
              aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.  The study aims to reconstruct
              high-frequency climatic variations at decadal to sub-decadal  resolution.  The
              records will be dated with a combination of varve counts and multiple 14C dates
              to ensure as accurate and detailed a chronology as possible.  Three sites were
              chosen for analysis to mediate potential complications caused by local climatic
              effects in mountainous regions.
