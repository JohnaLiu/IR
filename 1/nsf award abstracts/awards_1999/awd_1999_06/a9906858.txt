Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop, implement, and test a
              methodology for building inductive databases (IDBs), which extend conventional
              databases by integrating in them inductive inference capabilities. Such
              capabilities allow a database to answer questions that require synthesizing
              plausible knowledge on the basis of the facts in the databases. The methodology
              integrates a database with a host of inductive inference operators that can be
              evoked automatically through scripts, called Knowledge Scouts, and expressed in
              a Knowledge Generation Language. Proposed ideas are tested experimentally on
              two datasets, one characterizing life changes in post-communist countries, and
              the second relating lifestyles with diseases.
