Microscopic phenomena in
              three-phase fluidization systems will be investigated at high pressures (up to
              21 MPa) and high temperatures (up to 200 degrees C).  The fluidization and
              visualization laboratory facility was developed in the previous NSF sponsored
              project.     Initial bubble formation, jetting, and breakup will be visualized
              and mechanistically modeled.  The effects of particle inertia, bubble
              instability, heat transfer, pressure and temperature will be included in a
              microscopic model.  Macroscopic modeling of mixture flow in high-pressure
              slurry bubble columns will be performed including critical gas velocity for
              particle suspension and gas holdup.  An attempt will be made to generalize the
              results for various properties of the gas, liquid and solid phases.  This is
              GOALI project performed in collaboration between the Ohio State University and
              a network of four companies: Shell, Texaco Oil, Exxon R&D, and Hydrocarbon
              Research Inc.  The industrial partners will contribute to the research with
              personnel, design of parts of the experimental facility and feedback from
              large-scale experiments.  
If successful, the project will provide fundamental
              research data for high pressure/high temperature three-phase fluidization
              systems, with immediate relevance to petrochemical industry and specifically on
              methanol synthesis, benzene hydrogenation and resin hydrotreating.
