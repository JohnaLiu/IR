Abstract    :
              The proposed exploratory research will link the biogeochemistry modules of the
              NCAR CSM with the atmospheric transport code in CCM3 and compare the results to
              available observations. The transport of the passive chemical tracer in the
              CCM3 will be evaluated by repeating an SF6 experiment recently completed by
              other major models in an international intercomparison, TransCom 2. The work is
              important because it will be the first step to link biogeochemical fluxes and
              concentrations across modules in the CSM; to use resulting simulated
              atmospheric concentration fields to pinpoint  model deficiencies, and to work
              with both NCAR and university colleagues to address and  correct these
              deficiencies.
