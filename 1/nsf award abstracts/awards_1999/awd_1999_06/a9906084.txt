Description:  This award is for support of a cooperative
              project by Dr. Richard Rand, Department of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at
              Cornell University and Dr. Mohamed Belhaq, Department of Physics, Laboratory of
              Mechanics, Faculty of Science, University Hassan II, Ain Chock, Casablanca,
              Morocco.  The two scientists plan to investigate quasi-periodic oscillations,
              chaos and the control of chaos in certain physical systems.  The two
              scientists' groups have independently developed new ideas on these topics that
              provide the basis for the proposed research.  The research project concerns a
              theoretical, numerical and experimental study of parametric convective
              instability in traditional and magnetic fluids.  Attention will be focused on
              the case of a fluid layer simultaneously forced by periodic variations in body
              forces and in temperature gradient.  Investigations will be made of the
              quasi-periodic behavior, and a stability analysis of the basic state of the
              system will also be carried out.   The results will be compared with
              experimental work.

Scope:  This award will allow collaboration between two
              qualified scientists who have done independent research.  The work is to be
              divided between the two sides based on the special skills and the available
              resources.  Dr. Belhaq has spent the summer of 1997, under a Fulbright grant,
              working with Dr. Rand at Cornell University, so it is expected that the two
              will collaborate with each other successfully.  This proposal meets the INT
              objective of increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.
