Abstract    :
              This doctoral dissertation research completes a cross-national comparative study
              of tropical land conflicts in Belize, Guatemala and Mexico, examining land
              policies by governmental institutions as they apply to tropical forest
              conservation and Mayan customary practices. The study differentiates national
              and indigenous land tenure systems and the social pressures bearing on them.
              Knowledge of the linkages between land tenure conflicts, ethnic vitality and
              environmental factors inform the particular forms of conservation management
              chosen by individual governments. Two weeks will be spent at the Land Tenure
              Center Library at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, followed by a six month
              field investigation in four Mexican states, Belize and Guatemala. The research
              consists of interviews, historical documentation, and the development of case
              studies in Mexico and Guatemala. Interviewees will include representatives from
              national governments, local offices, non-governmental organizations,
              socio-political organizations, and individuals operating as farmers, natural
              resource workers, and indigenous leaders. Historical and legal research will
              occur at universities in four tropical Mexican states and at archives in
              Belize, completing fifteen months of previous field investigation.
