Abstract    :
              
	This research explores the precise nature, sources, and consequences of
              differing perceptions of the criminal justice system by African-American and
              white citizens. Both interracial and intra-racial differences will be assessed.
              It is hypothesized that the differences (both inter-, and intra-racial) will be
              driven, in large measure, by the varying content, as well as the relative
              weights, assigned to three sets of prior beliefs held by individuals: racial
              stereotypes, causal theories of crime, and judgments of the fairness of the
              criminal justice system.  The study involves a national telephone survey of 500
              whites and 500 blacks using computer assisted telephone interviewing.  The
              research will contribute to scientific knowledge in a number of important but
              neglected areas of study, including racial differences on criminal justice
              issues, opinion-formation on criminal-justice issues, and the role of
              stereotyping in explaining racial differences.
