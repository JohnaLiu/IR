Abstract    :
              The grant will partically support attendence of U.S. scientists at the Fourth
              ISHMT-ASME Heat and Mass Transfer Conference in Pune, India in January 2000. 
              The American attendees will contribute as panelists   
discussing research 
              and educational programs, participate in special workshops which will be held
              in conjunction with the conference, and present state- of- the- art reviews. 
              The conference will provide a forum for the synthesis of the knowledge base
              that has been developed and in isolating key issues to be addressed in future
              research.  In the field of thermal science and technologies, India is one of
              the leading Asian countries and research performed by its scientists is of
              particular relevance to the developing nations and of interest to the global
              community.  The conference will include workshops held off side on industrial
              research emerging thermal technologies  solidification, computational fluid
              mechanics, and materials processing and manufacturing.  Participation is
              expected to be of the order of 400, with 40 US and 50 European attendees.
