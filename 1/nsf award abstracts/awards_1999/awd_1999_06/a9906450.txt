Abstract    :
              This award enables young scientists to attend the Workshop on Steroid Hormones
              and Brain Function and give a talk in a section designed for promising new
              scientists, the Young Investigator Symposium. The Workshop on Steroid Hormones
              and Brain Function is a forum in which state-of-the-art concepts and
              technologies are discussed among neuroendocrinologists.  The workshop has been
              in existence for 7 years and the National Science Foundation has funded the
              Young Investigator Symposium during the last 5 years.  Since the number of
              participants is limited to approximately 100, it provides a venue for
              investigators to present their data in an informal atmosphere and fosters
              interactions among participants, especially between young and established
              investigators.  The experience and exposure gained by the new investigators
              attending the meeting can facilitate the establishment of future collaborations
              and can broaden their scientific perspective of the field.
