This award will support a series of regular technology
              transfer and outreach activities (meetings, site visits, education,
              demonstrations, etc.) between the National Partnership for Advanced
              Computational Infrastructure (NPACI) and the Federal Web Consortium (FedCon), a
              group of Federal agencies.  NPACI is a broad collaborative group of nearly
              thirty institutions creating a national networked distributed computing
              infrastructure.  The FedCon agencies are focused on obtaining a better view of
              the future world of networked computing, very large databases, simulation, and
              visualization.  NPACI represents a technology smorgasbord for Federal agencies
              interested in a better strategic view of computing and communications.
