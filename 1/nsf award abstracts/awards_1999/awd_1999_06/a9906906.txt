Abstract    :
              This three-year study will investigate the average characteristics and potential
              changes in the hydrology of three major Russian rivers, the Ob, Lena, and
              Yenesei Rivers.  These three rivers are important for the Arctic region because
              they carry much of the freshwater runoff from the continents into the Arctic
              Ocean.  Also, it is likely that climate change may interact with the hydrology
              of these rivers in ways that will have cascading affects on terrigenous and
              marine ecosystems.  In this study, past weather archives will be used to
              evaluate a time-series of important atmospheric characteristics such as the
              difference between precipitation and evaporation.  Records of precipitation and
              river runoff and satellite-based data on snow distributions will be
              incorporated to test whether winter precipitation in regions south of the
              Arctic Circle control the spring river runoff of these rivers, while summer
              precipitation is largely water recycled from terrestrial evaporation. 
              Long-termed changes in the water cycle will be examined from these data.  The
              results should lead to better understanding of the controls on the water cycle
              in central and northern Siberia, which will be important in future efforts to
              predict impacts of climate change on the Arctic region.
