Abstract    :
              This award is to provide travel support to the 10th International Conference on
              Wind Engineering for several U.S. participants.  The conference will be held in
              Copenhagen, Denmark during June 21-24, 1999.  Interaction by U.S. delegates
              with international researchers and practitioners in wind engineering will
              provide the opportunity to present research and development in the U.S. to the
              world community.  The American Association for Wind Engineering will play a
              major role in administering this project.
