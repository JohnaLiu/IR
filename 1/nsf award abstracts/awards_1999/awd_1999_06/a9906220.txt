Description:  This award is for support of a cooperative
              project by Dr. Selim Unlu, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
              Boston University and Dr. Ekmel Ozbay, Department of Physics at Bilkent
              University, Ankara, Turkey.  The two investigators plan to conduct research to
              1) study high performance photodetectors operating at 1.55 micrometer
              wavelength with bandwidth-efficiency (BWE) products approaching 100 GHz.  2)
              design, fabricate and characterize these photodetectors.   The proposed
              detectors are top-illuminated photodiodes with optical design based on resonant
              cavity enhanced (RCE) detection scheme.  The final product of this research
              will be a major improvement in the bandwidth efficiency performance of
              photodetectors, which will have applications in long-haul optical communication
              systems. 

Scope:  This award will allow collaboration between Turkish and US
              scientists who have complementary capabilities and experience.  The planned
              collaboration will support the Boston University research initiative to expand
              scientific knowledge and experience in photodetectors, and to produce a new
              family of photodetectors whose performance is enhanced by placing the active
              device structure inside a Fabry-Perot resonant microcavity.  The RCE detection
              scheme can be used in many detector designs to improve the device sensitivity
              and speed.  Two graduate students at Boston University will participate in this
              collaborative project.  This proposal meets the INT objective of increasing
              US-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.
