Abstract    :
              The proposal seeks to sponsor engineering students to attend the 1999 IEEE
              Conference on Decision and Control (CDC).  The CDC is a major conference that
              deals with control theory and applications.  The technical program consists of
              over 1000 contributed and invited papers assembled in about 150 sessions.  The
              research topics include uncertain dynamic systems dealing with optimization,
              adapation, learning, and decision and feedback control.  The major applications
              include aerospace, manufacturing, transportation, bioengineering, and
              communication systems.  Travel support for student attendance will be
              advertised nationwide and women, minorities, and disabled students will be
              especially encouraged to apply for a  travel award.
