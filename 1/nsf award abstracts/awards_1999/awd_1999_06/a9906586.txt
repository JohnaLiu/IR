Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop a fundamental 
understanding of how
              changes in a fungal cell's local nutrient 
environment can affect growth and
              branching.  The natural tendency 
of fungal cells is to show varied branching
              patterns in the 
presence of different nutrient concentrations.  This will be
              
exploited as a framework to understand how the external 
environment alters
              fungal morphology, and hence rheology.  This 
project is a university-industry
              collaboration which involves Novo 
Nordisk BioChem North America, a leading
              enzyme manufacturer.  
This company is to provide an industrially-relevant
              fungal strain, 
Aspergillus oryzae, which produces the enzyme alpha-amylase. 
              In 
addition, the company will be an active participant in the 
research. 
              The specific aims of the project are to: (1) quantify 
transient nutrient
              environments (TRE's) in an industrial-scale 
fungal fermentation, and
              determine how TNE's are affected by broth 
rheology, (2) characterize how
              TNE's and certain drugs 
(paramorphogens) alter the degree-of-branching in
              individual 
fungal mycelia, (3) determine how the degree-of-branching in
              
individual mycelia affects clump morphology, and how this affects 
broth
              rheology, and (4) determine how TNE's affect clump 
morphology, broth
              rheology, and protein expression.
