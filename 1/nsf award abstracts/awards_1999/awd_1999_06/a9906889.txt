Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for a geodynamic modeling study of associations between
              magmatism and extension on rifted continental margins. The research will focus
              on understanding the tectonomagmatic history of the crust in the
              ocean-continent transition zone and the transition from continental rifting to
              steady state seafloor spreading.  Preliminary modeling by the PI suggest that
              intra-lithospheric processes may be a key to understanding the differences
              between volcanic rifted margins and non-volcanic rifted margins and the
              formation of crust at the ocean-continent transition. Proposed research will
              extend the study in three stages: development of a series of dynamic models of
              lithospheric extension; development of a quasi-dynamic modeling technique in
              which simple shear is approximated kinematically; and the application of the
              models of lithospheric deformation to define an upper boundary condition to be
              applied to a series of models that investigate convection and melting processes
              in the asthenosphere. Data from the Iberian and Grand Banks conjugate margins
              will be use to constrain the models.
