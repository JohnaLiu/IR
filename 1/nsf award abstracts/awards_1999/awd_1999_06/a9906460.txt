Abstract    :
              The proposed exploratory research will undertake a comprehensive diagnosis of
              the NCAR atmospheric (CCM3) and climate system model (CSM). The objective of
              the proposed dynamical diagnosis is to enhance the representation of the
              observed modes of recurrent seasonal-to-interannual variability in the CSM runs
              so that climate-impact assessments for increased greenhouse gases and
              seasonal-to-interannual predictions obtained from this model are more credible.
              The research tasks include (a) residual diagnosis of diabatic heating from
              high-resolution ECMWF and NCEP reanalyses to generate validating targets, (b)
              rotated principal component analysis of combined variability of circulation
              anomalies and their potential forcing, e.g. ocean surface and subsurface
              temperature, surface winds, diabatic heating and upper-level winds in the
              coupled model, and (c) diagnostic modeling of observed and simulated
              variability using a high-resolution linear primitive equation model. The work
              is important because it should provide a strong diagnostics underpinning to the
              NCAR CSM project from a university based group engaged in dynamical diagnosis
              of observed climate variability for the past several years.
