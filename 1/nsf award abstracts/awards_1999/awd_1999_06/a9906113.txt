Description: This award supports a planning visit by
              Professor Kevin H. Johannesson of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA.  He
              will visit Kuwait University to work with Professor Michael Duane on
              preliminary investigations and on planning for a joint research proposal to be
              submitted to NSF and to the counterpart Kuwaiti Foundation for the Advancement
              of Science (KFAS).  They plan to investigate secular changes in coastal
              aquifers of Kuwait by studying the chemical stratigraphy and diageneses within
              individual formations by cementation studies, rare earth element and isotopic
              measurements, and investigations, via cathodoluminescence, of fluid-rock
              interactions.  The collaborative relationships among the two institutions will
              provide potentially unique opportunities for graduate students to learn. The
              proposal meets INT objectives for supporting planning visits when they are
              essential for developing international collaboration.
