Abstract    :
              The planned work seeks to investigate mechanisms of Tropical Atlantic
              Variability (TAV) using the CCM coupled to an ocean mixed layer model. Three
              process-oriented experiments are proposed: 
(i) Air-sea Feedback Experiment.
              This will test important positive feedback processes in the tropical Atlantic
              region. In particular, the PIs will determine whether or not, wind-induced heat
              flux is a major contributing factor to seasonal-to-decadal variability in the
              tropical Atlantic. 
(ii) Remote Influence Experiment. This will quantify the
              magnitude and location of the strongest remote influence from Pacific ENSO on
              TAV. The PI will examine how the remote influence of ENSO interacts with local
              air-sea feedbacks in TAV. 
(iii) Ocean Process Experiment. This will explore
              the effect of oceanic processes on TAV. The PI will investigate how oceanic
              heat advection by mean currents and by anomalous Ekman flow interacts with
              coupled processes in tropical Atlantic
The work is important  because it will
              enhance  basic understanding on low frequency climate variability in the
              Tropical Atlantic. Such an understanding is fundamental for making improved
              climate forecasts for the region, this has societal benefits.
