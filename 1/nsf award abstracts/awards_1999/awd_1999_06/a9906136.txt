Abstract    :
              Like most Muslim and many Christian countries around the world, Israel has a
              legal system in which religious law holds an institutional position in state
              law.   The tension between secular and religious principles in law can be seen
              in the decisions of the Israeli High Court of Justice, an institution that
              offers a focal point for this research.  This project involves the analysis of
              writings of the justices of this court on matters of religion and state,
              including, but not limited to judicial decisions, as well as the briefs and
              other legal materials of women's social-movement attorneys who have challenged
              rabbinical authorities.  The research question is how the court came to move
              more and more deliberately into establishing secular women's rights.
