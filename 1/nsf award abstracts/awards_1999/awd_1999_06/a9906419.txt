Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to develop and test models of social
              stratification that capitalize on the actual occupations that emerge around
              functional niches in the division of labor. To do so, the project will employ
              large-scale surveys from the United States and other countries. The trend in
              recent theoretical approaches has been to dismiss these phenomena as
              sociologically trivial. However, doing so ignores evidence that important
              social class processes occur principally at the subclass level. One virtue of
              disaggregating to this level is that the nominal categories of aggregate class
              analysis can be replaced by groupings which are meaningful not merely to
              sociologists but to the lay public as well. Disaggregation should yield new
              evidence on such basic issues as (a) the fluidity of modern mobility regimes,
              (b) the structure of recent trends in inheritance, persistence, and
              inter-occupational mobility, (c) the macro-level causes that generate
              immobility, and (d) the viability of convergence models in characterizing
              cross-national patterns of stratification. The proof of our approach thus rests
              on the additional explanatory power that accrues from referencing the real
              institutional processes by which classes are formed, mobility is constrained,
              and lifestyles are defined.
