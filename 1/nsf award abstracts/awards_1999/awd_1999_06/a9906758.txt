Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop the DNA microarray technology for
              bacteria in bioprocessing.  This technology has recently been developed to
              speed up the process of identifying microbial genes of specific function.  The
              process involves the differential detection of the transcription product, mRNA,
              under 
changing environmental conditions.  The method has been successfully
              applied to eucaryotes, but not to bacteria where the mRNA is less stable, is in
              lower concentrations, and, in particular, does not have a poly-A tail to
              facilitate isolation.  E. coli will be used as a model for organisms.  In
              particular, this research will optimize RNA purification, labeling, and
              hybridization techniques for microbial systems.  These technologies could lead
              to future applications of the DNA microarray to metabolic engineering and other
              microbial problems.
