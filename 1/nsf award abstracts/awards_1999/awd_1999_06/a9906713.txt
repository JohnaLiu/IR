Spatially-explicit forest models have been successfully
              developed for several temperate forests.  Some such models, such as SORTIE,
              have been successful at capturing several realistic features of forest
              development and have been widely accepted as realistic.  Until now, these types
              of models have been applied to the complex forests that develop in Tropical
              habitats to only a very limited extent.

Hurricane Georges struck forests on
              Puerto Rico with devastating effects in September 1998.  This storm followed
              other hurricanes that struck the island during the past 10 years.  The
              devastating effects of Hurricane Georges have one advantage for developing a
              SORTIE-like model for the Puerto Rico forest.  They provide an opportunity to
              apply the model directly to the development of a tropical forest immediately
              following its natural disturbance.  This project requires a SGER timeline
              because it will collect the initial field data necessary for the application of
              the model, data that must be collected immediately following a disturbance in a
              rapidly developing tropical ecosystem.  The model will be used to address a
              broad suite of hypotheses on the effects of recurrent hurricanes on species
              diversity, community dynamics, and ecosystem structure and function in tropical
              forests by testing empirically based prediction on the responses of tropical
              forests to hurricanes.
