That top-down and bottom-up forces interact in various ways
              to the control basic features of ecosystems is widely appreciated but the
              factors that control the balance of these forces is far from completely
              understood.  This project will continue an earlier three-year experimental
              study of oak herbivore populations in which nutrients and bird-predation
              pressure had been manipulated in a factorial design. Initial results had
              differed from previous terrestrial experimental studies and the present project
              will seek to explain those differences among studies by considering different
              size classes of trees.  It will specifically test whether top-down effects
              occur on large but not small saplings, the relative strength of top-down forces
              with increasing nutrient availability, and the existence of a time lag in the
              generation of top-down forces on herbivores from the arthropod predator
              community.  This study will contribute to the understanding of the trophic
              dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems.  It will also provide an opportunity for
              numerous undergraduate students to gain a substantial research experience.
