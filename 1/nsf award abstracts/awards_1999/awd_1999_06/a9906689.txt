Abstract    :
              The PI will use cores collected by ODP in the western North Atlantic in all
              major water-mass depths to study millennial scale changes in deep and
              intermediate water properties during the glacial-interglacial cycle represented
              by marine isotope stages 11 and 12 (470-360 ka).  The study will monitor
              high-frequency changes in the production of North Atlantic Ceep Water and
              Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water.  The study will also help quantify
              the contributions of bottom water-temperature change and ice-volume change to
              the overall oxygen-isotopic composition in that time interval, that will alow
              to better constrain the magnitude of sea-level change, which has been
              hypothesized to have been 30% greater than the most recent sea-level rise
              following last glacial maximum.
