Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this project is to investigate iron limitation in
              marine phytoplankton using the newly discovered fluorescence diagnostic
              technique. The project encompasses both laboratory and field components. The
              laboratory studies are aimed at resolving the physiological mechanism(s) for
              the fluorescence diagnostic of iron limitation and testing for its expression
              across major phytoplankton taxonomic divisions. These studies are based on
              continuous culture experiments and will include measurements of. (1) variable
              fluorescence parameters, (2) fluorescence emission spectra, (3) picosecond
              fluorescence lifetimes, and (4) the stoichiometric composition of the
              photosystems. The laboratory studies will address the following
              questions:

(1)  	Does the fluorescence diagnostic result from an effect of
              iron limitation on the fluorescence signature of state transitions or the
              back-transfer of electrons from a highly reduced plastoquinone pool to the
              primary acceptor on Photosystem II?

(2)  	Is the fluorescence diagnostic
              equally expressed in all taxonomic divisions under iron limiting conditions or
              is it restricted to prokaryotic photoautotrophs?

The modest field component
              will be conducted to explore the utility of this technique in nature.
