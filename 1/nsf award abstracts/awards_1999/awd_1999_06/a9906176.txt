Abstract    :
              	Teaching SMART, a program of Girls Incorporated of Rapid City (South Dakota), a
              division of Youth & Family Services, is an equity-based, comprehensive
              three-year teacher professional development program designed to produce
              systemic change in the classroom by improving science education at the
              elementary school level.  The mission of Teaching SMART is to encourage the
              performance and persistence of all students, particularly girls and minority
              youth, in elementary science.  To achieve this end, Teaching SMART provides
              instruction and hands-on training for third through fifth grade teachers which
              increase their awareness of and comfort level in using equitable, hands-on,
              inquiry, and exploration based approaches to teaching science.  The success of
              the program is based on its long-term commitment to educational reform, which
              can only be accomplished through a comprehensive professional development
              training model such as Teaching SMART.  
	The Teaching SMART National Teacher
              Training and Technical Assistance Program seeks to replicate the Teaching SMART
              program in five diverse urban and rural school districts across the nation: 
              Greater Atlanta, Georgia; New Orleans, Louisiana; Bay City, Michigan;
              Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Fairmont, West Virginia.
