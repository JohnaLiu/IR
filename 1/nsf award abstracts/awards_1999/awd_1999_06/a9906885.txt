Abstract    :
              This doctoral dissertation research project explores how educational decisions
              are made by Peruvian families. Using both quantitative and qualitative
              techniques, it investigates how cultural demands, human capital and past
              schooling experience, family economy, family structure and networks, actual
              versus perceived school quality, and community context coalesce in creating the
              values and aspirations families assign to education. Family members do not
              always agree on the amount of education children should receive. Because of
              this, we also explore how these differences are resolved when they arise. As we
              elucidate the process by which families make educational decision, we
              simultaneously investigate how these translate into various schooling outcomes.
              We tie these outcomes together in an educational history for each child to
              explore their connection and the influence each has on the pathway familial
              decisions follow. The quantitative data come from the nationally representative
              Encuesta Nacional Sobre Medicion de Niveles de Vida. An event history approach
              and multi-level modeling will incorporate both a cross-sectional as well as a
              longitudinal components in the analysis. After uncovering quantitative trends,
              we will conduct in-depth interviews in Peru with key players in the
              decision-making process: parents, children, extended kin, teachers, school
              administrators, and community leaders.
