Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to develop and test an autonomous, time-series, in situ benthic
              invertebrate recruitment sampler for use in a variety of soft-sediment
              habitats.  The sampler design will be based on a previously developed
              instrument (called ELVIS) that was constructed for sampling the water column.
              The new sampler will permit controlled and repeated exposure of larval
              settlement substrates to different physical conditions (e.g. water flow, light
              levels, temperature ).  This project has three primary objectives:  First, to
              design and construct a sediment-deployed recruitment sampler which will be
              integrated to a controller-microprocessor and environmental sensors to permit
              the sampler to operate in fully autonomous mode. Second, to conduct a series of
              laboratory and field tests to assess operational constraints and sampling
              assumptions of the device.  Third, to examine the sampling device's performance
              and limitations in a number of shallow water habitats.
