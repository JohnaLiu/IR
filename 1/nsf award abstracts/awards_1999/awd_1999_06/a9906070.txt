Kodama
This grant provides partial support for the costs of acquiring
              a superconducting rock magnetometer, an automatic degausser, an automatic
              sample handler, and a magnetostatically-shielded room for the paleomagnetics
              laboratory at Lehigh University. The PI, Ken Kodama, a full professor in the
              Earth and Environmental Sciences Department at Lehigh, and his graduate
              students, as well as undergraduates conducting paleomagnetic research projects,
              will use the equipment in their research.
The new paleomagnetic equipment at
              Lehigh will replace an aging superconducting rock magnetometer and a
              malfunctioning alternating field demagnetizer. Both of these pieces of
              equipment are no longer supported by their manufacturers. The equipment will
              allow the PI and his students to continue their work on delineating the effects
              of burial compaction on the magnetic inclination of magnetite and
              hematite-bearing sedimentary rocks, the effects of tectonic strain on the
              accuracy of a paleomagnetic direction, and on environmental magnetic studies of
              recent lake sediments. The magnetostatically-shielded room will be particularly
              important for the continuation of the PI's most recent compaction correction
              work on weakly magnetized marine sedimentary rocks that suggest allochthoneity
              for western North American terranes. The new paleomagnetic equipment and the
              magnetostatically-shielded room will be complemented by existing paleomagnetic
              equipment at Lehigh  (thermal demagnetizer, impulse magnetizer, partial
              anhysteretic remanent magnetization (pARM) magnetizer, and sampling drills) and
              a recently acquired, partially NSF-funded anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility
              (AMS) meter.
