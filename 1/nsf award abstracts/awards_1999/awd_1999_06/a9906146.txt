Abstract    :
              Planning Grant Equity by Design.  The planning grant for Equity by Design will
              build a coalition of public and private educational institutions that have a
              positive, supportive, and sustaining academic environment for women students in
              science, math, engineering and technology (SMET).  This community will be built
              in western New York State through extensive faculty development activities. 
              Members of the coalition are presently sponsoring activities to influence the
              status of women in SMET programs and plan to improve the academic environments
              of their institutions by working together.
