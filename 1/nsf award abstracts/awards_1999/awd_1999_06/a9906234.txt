Abstract    :
              This study focuses on an emergent occupational group, lawyers in China, at a key
              moment in their professional development.  The existing research literature
              documenting the way that occupational groups become bona fide professions
              provides the starting point for this project.  In China, it is hypothesized,
              foreign investment and international trade are giving lawyers unique access to,
              and jurisdiction over, important new territory. China thus provides an ideal
              laboratory for testing theories about legal professionalization and
              globalization.  The research involves the collection of multi-level data on
              lawyers and their firms through a mail survey of 1,000 randomly-selected
              lawyers in Beijing. Data will include the background characteristics of
              lawyers, the structure and organization of legal practice, income and legal
              receipts, the distribution of time and client billings across fields of legal
              practice, corporate and personal clients, patterns of client refusals, case
              settlement methods, and attitudes and opinions.  This material will be made
              available for public use.
