This project is a contribution to the World Ocean
              Circulation Experiment, In particular the AIMS (Analysis, Interpretation,
              Modeling, and Synthesis) component.  In this project, the PI will carry out
              studies of circulation and transport in the tropical Indian Ocean at 8.5oNorth,
              and in the Indo-Australian Basin (IAB).  The extensive set of ocean current
              measurements made using shipboard and lowered Acoustic Doppler Current
              Profilers will be interpreted, both themselves, and with velocity measurements
              from the other WOCE systems (floats, hydrography, tracers, etc.).  As part of a
              group synthesis effort, this work will focus on regional studies of the Arabian
              Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Indo-Australian Basin.  The overall objective
              will be to calculate the total top-to-bottom fluxes of heat, freshwater,
              chemical tracers, and nutrients for these three regions for comparison with
              models, and with other oceans at similar latitudes.
