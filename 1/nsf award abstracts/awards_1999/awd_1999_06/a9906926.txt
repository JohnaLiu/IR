In this work, sub-surface current meter data will be
              assimilated into 
two and three-dimensional numerical models of tidal flows in
              the 
Weddell Sea.  Inverse methods will be used to guide improvements of
              
parameterizations of the effects of diurnal vorticity waves and of 
friction
              in the bottom boundary layer.  Since the Weddell Sea is 
close to the critical
              latitudes for the main semi-diurnal tide and 
has weak stratification, the
              bottom boundary layer is thick and the 
tidal flow is relatively barotropic,
              simplifying the modeling task 
and allowing a better characterization of the
              flow by the current 
meters.
