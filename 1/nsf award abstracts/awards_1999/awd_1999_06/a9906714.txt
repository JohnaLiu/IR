This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement research project
              focuses on the coexistence of two incompatible structures in organized
              associations.  As associations organize bureaucratically to resolve collective
              action problems, their substantive goals are subject to shift toward formal
              bureaucratic goals-a tendency, which intensifies as the group increases in size
              and complexity.  Organized associations are found in the "third sector," a term
              referring to an array of religious, community, and philanthropic groups
              oriented toward the achievement of collective goals.  This study hypothesizes
              that bureaucratization produces a number of important effects, including
              alienation.  Bureaucratization is measured as a ratio of paid staff to
              operational volunteers performing comparable tasks.  Member alienation is
              measured by the rate of turnover for members, broken down by organizational
              position, and controlled for demographic changes.

Data will be obtained from
              a total or nearly total sample of local chapters of a national membership
              organization (Girl Scouts of the United States of America) having both
              volunteer and paid staff structures at all levels. A database will be
              constructed, broken down according to client or agent member status and by
              organizational position, constituting one of the most complete and consistent
              datasets ever to be compiled in third sector research.
