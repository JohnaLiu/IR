Abstract    :
              Ledwell OCE-9906685
The tracer patch that was purposefully released in 1996 in
              the Brazil basin on a 
density surface about 1000 meters above one of the
              valleys, and 500 meters 
over the tops of the surrounding abyssal hills will
              be resampled In the year 
2000nto significantly extend the direct measurements
              of diapycnal diffusivities 
and horizontal dispersion. In addition, several
              shearmeter floats will be deployed 
to spatially extend the observations of
              the internal wave shear field gathered with 
a single current meter mooring
              deployed in 1998 above the valley were the tracer 
was released.
