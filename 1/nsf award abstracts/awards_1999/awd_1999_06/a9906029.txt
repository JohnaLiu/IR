This grant provides partial support for the purchase of a
              cathodoluminescence (CL) system that will replace a 20-year old (non-functional
              and irreparable) Nuclide CL scope.  The proposed equipment consists of a
              PATCO/Nuclide ELM-3R Luminoscope attached to an Olympus B-Max 50 research
              microscope.  To aid in the acquisition of typically low-light CL images, the
              microscope will be equipped with a Diagnostic Instruments SPOT digital camera. 
              A dedicated computer (400 MHz Pentium II or equivalent) and image analysis
              software (e.g., Adobe Photoshop) will allow for processing of the digital
              photographs. 

Many minerals (e.g., calcite, dolomite, quartz, feldspar,
              diamond) exhibit luminescence when bombarded by an electron beam (Marshall,
              1988).  Impurities and/or lattice defects within minerals significantly affect
              the luminescence phenomenon; accordingly cathodoluminescence microscopy is a
              powerful tool for the study of compositional and structural variations in
              minerals.  Its use in sedimentary petrography is well established (e.g., Machel
              and Burton, 1991), but it is also extremely valuable for other geochemical and
              structural studies (Sippel and Spencer, 1970; Dorobek and Watkinson, 1988;
              Marshall, 1988, Onasch and Davis, 1988; Perny et al., 1992).  The equipment
              will be used by four investigators for varied aspects of research and education
              within the School of Geology & Geophysics at the University of Oklahoma. 
              Anticipated uses include the following:  (1)  Sedimentary Geology Research and
              Education (G.S. Soreghan); (2)  Quartz of Igneous Origin (D. London);  (3) 
              Compaction/Cementation Studies  (T.A. Dewers); (4)  Microscale Strain Analysis
              (K.J. Smart).
