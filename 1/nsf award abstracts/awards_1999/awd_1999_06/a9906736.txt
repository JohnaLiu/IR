In this project, the PIs will carry ouit a field survey of
              currents and hydrography during the summer of 2000 to study overflow dynamics
              within the Faroe Bank Channel.  Issues to be addressed include: transport and
              momentum balance of the overflow; how the overflow water approacheds the sill,
              and whether the approach is hydraulically controlled; and, where and how the
              mixing and entrainment occur in the descending overflow.  The principal
              techniques to be used would be CTDs (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth -- 210
              stations) and XCPs (Expendable Current Profilers -- 110 stations) supplemented
              with GPS-corrected ship's acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and lowered
              ADCP. The high resolution proposed has apparently not been done before in this
              region.
