Abstract    :
              A proof-of-concept study was conducted in 1998 to improve seismic constraints on
              the cause of Hawaiian swell relief.  Eight ocean-bottom pressure gauges were
              deployed in a hexagonal array to the southeast of the Hawaiian Islands.  The
              data collected in this study was used to construct a one-dimensional model of
              the structure beneath the array.  This continuation will extend the analysis to
              a three-dimensional image of the isotropic structure beneath the array and
              assess the anisotropic structure.  Data from land-based stations will be used
              to augment the existing data.
