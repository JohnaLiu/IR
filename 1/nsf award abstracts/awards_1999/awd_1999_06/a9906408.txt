Abstract    :
              The investigator will study the dynamics of the neutral thermosphere and the
              mesopause and the coupling effects between these regions and the ionospheric
              plasma.  The study will use various forms of Fabry-Perot interferometers that
              determine velocities and temperatures from measured Doppler shifts and widths
              of selected nightglow emissions such as the 630 nm line of atomic oxygen. 
              Observations will be made at the University of Pittsburgh, at the Arequipa
              Automated Airglow Observatory in Peru, and at the Millstone Hill Observatory in
              Massachusetts.  Determinations of Doppler shifts and widths of nightglow
              emission lines will be made by upgraded Fabry-Perot interferometer instruments
              with improved sensitivity.  A new zero velocity reference source emitting the
              forbidden oxygen lines at 630.0 and 577.7 nm will be used for improved lower
              and upper thermosphere horizontal and vertical velocity determinations.  From
              these observations, the climatology of the wind and temperature fields at each
              altitude will be deduced and coupling effects between the regions will be
              studied.
