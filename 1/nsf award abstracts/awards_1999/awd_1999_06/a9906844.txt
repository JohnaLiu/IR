OPP-9906844

A 160 meter ice core of opportunity was recovered
              during a drill test in 1996 from the St. Elias Mountains.  The core was shipped
              to the University of New Hampshire.  Subsequent major ion analyses of snowpit
              samples and a short (3.5 meter) section of the core from a depth of 112.5-116
              meters indicates that a well preserved glaciochemical record is available from
              Eclipse Dome ice core.  The Principal Investigator will develop a
              multi-parameter, high resolution paleoclimate record for the past 200 years
              through the chemical (major ions and oxygen isotopes) analysis of the Eclipse
              ice core.  He will also collect and analyze available gridded meteorological
              data and instrumental meteorological records from stations surrounding the St.
              Elias Mountains.  This observational data will be used to calibrate the ice
              core record and a variety of meteorological variables.

Preliminary analyses
              indicates that the Eclipse Dome record should provide a record that is
              complimentary to the 290 year ice core record recovered from 5,430 meters on
              Mt. Logan.  The continuous, high resolution, multi-parameter ice core that the
              Principal Investigator will use should provide data to investigate temporal
              variations in the physical climate system, air chemistry, and biogeochemical
              cycling.  The Eclipse Dome record should be a valuable contribution for a
              data-poor region to the  growing network of multi-parameter, annually resolved
              ice core and tree-ring records from the Arctic  that can be used to document
              the regional characteristics of global climate change events.
