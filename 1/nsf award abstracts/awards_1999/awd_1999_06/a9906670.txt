Abstract    :
              This pilot study will examine the impact of federally-funded research on the
              formation, survival, and growth of biotechnology firms over a 26-year period. 
              Specifically, the effects of the geographic distribution of science funding
              relative to the local area characteristics that affect the transfer of academic
              expertise to commercial activity will be investigated.  In addition, the role
              of NIH-funded researchers as founders, officers, and collaborators in
              biotechnology start-ups will be studied.  Methodologies will be developed that
              facilitate the linkage between NIH data and commercial applications.  Finally,
              a detailed analysis will be conducted of the field of science and commercial
              applications by institution, city, and state as recorded in the NIH
              Computerized Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) data base.
               The research will enhance our understanding of technology transfer processes
              and of the diffusion of scientific information.  In addition, the results will
              be of significant interest to policy makers and to the business community.
