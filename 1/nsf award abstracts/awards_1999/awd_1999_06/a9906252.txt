Abstract    :
              This dissertation project will contribute to an understanding of the development
              of a new line of inquiry within the social and behavioral sciences in the
              post-World War II period. It will trace a set of ideas and practices known as
              group relations training from its inception within World War II military
              research, through university disciplines, and into industrial organizations in
              the United States. The goal of this project is to document the
              conceptualization and institutionalization of these ideas and practices as they
              circulated through various social and behavioral scientific communities of
              expertise over the last five decades. This will be accomplished through an
              examination of the institutional links and professional networks, as well as
              the research and practices of leading group relations trainers. The methods to
              be employed include archival research, collection of published and unpublished
              primary materials, oral history interviews, and participant-observation.
