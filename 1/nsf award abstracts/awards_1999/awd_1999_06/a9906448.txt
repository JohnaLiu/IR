Abstract    :
              "Pseudomonas 1999- The Seventh International Congress on Pseudomonas:
              Biotechnology and Pathogenesis" is to be held September 1-5, 1999 at Maui,
              Hawaii. The goal of this conference, is to bring together scientists from
              around the world with different sub-specialties that are relevant to
              Pseudomonas research. The genus Pseudomonas applies to gram-negative,
              nonenteric, generally non-fermenting, motile, aerobic bacteria. P. fluorescens,
              P. syringae, and Ralstonia (formerly Pseudomonas) solanacearum, are significant
              for their effects on plants. Some of these can infect plants and cause disease,
              while others can protect their hosts by the production of antibiotic compounds
              that prevent fungal infections. Additional environmental Pseudomonads, such as
              P. putida, can degrade various pollutants, including chloroaromatic and
              nitroaromatic compounds, and thus these bacteria have potential bioremediation
              applications; the metabolism of some of these compounds can also lead to the
              production of reagents of commercial value. Thus, the general topic of
              Pseudomonas research spans a number of disciplines, including plant pathology,
              environmental microbiology, metabolism, cell biology, and gene regulation. Many
              of the approaches, techniques, and analyses used span across these disciplines,
              however few venues are available to promote the interactions between the
              scientists in these diverse fields. At Pseudomonas 1999, the session topics and
              poster presentations will be organized to integrate these various topics,
              rather than to separate them.  It is anticipated that the format of this
              International Congress on Pseudomonas, as with the six previous meetings, will
              encourage the intermingling of scientists to find common interests, share new
              technologies, and develop fruitful collaborations across the various fields
              related to Pseudomonas. A concerted effort is being made to include younger
              scientists, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities
