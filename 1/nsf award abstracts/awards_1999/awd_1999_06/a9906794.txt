              ABSTRACT

Peter A. Monson, U. of Mass.

Research is being
              conducted into the molecular modeling of adsorption of fluids in porous
              materials.  The research addresses fundamental issues related to the use of
              adsorption for characterization of porous materials.  This has important
              applications in areas ranging from separations to catalysis to membranes to gas
              storage.  The project will use molecular models of adsorbents, which treat
              three-dimensional microstructural effects in a realistic way.  A key emphasis
              in the research program will be on cooperative phenomena involving length
              scales beyond that of a single pore.  Three areas of research
              are:

Developing a new approach to understanding hysteresis in
              adsorption/desorption isotherms in porous materials;

Study of lattice models
              of adsorption in disordered porous materials;

Modeling the influence of
              adsorbent structure modification on the adsorption process.

The research
              will involve the use of Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics techniques as well
              as theoretical methods from statistical mechanics, such as mean field density
              functional theory.

The principal investigator is collaborating with Dr. M.L.
              Rosinberg at the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.
