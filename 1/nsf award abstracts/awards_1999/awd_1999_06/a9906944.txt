Abstract    :
              A stable isotopic and elemental composition study of benthic foraminifera from
              the Oregon continental margin sites of active methane venting from the sea
              floor and from non-venting sites.  The study will develop a sediment proxy for
              distinguishing between different styles of methane flux, i.e., active, focused
              through vents or passibe via diffusion through pore water.  This will be
              accomplished through distinguishing the original signals recorded during
              benthic foraminiferal test calcification from the subsequent overgrowth by
              authigenic carbonates.
