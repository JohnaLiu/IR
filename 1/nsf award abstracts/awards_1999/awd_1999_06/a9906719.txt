Abstract    :
              The proposed research investigates how ordering a series of relations affects
              the exercise of power in each relation.  For example, the A - B - C network is
              ordered when B must exchange with A prior to exchanging with C.  We predict
              that A benefits from that ordering; A gains a better exchange ratio than would
              have been gained if B was not constrained to exchange first with A. A familiar
              example of ordering is gatekeeping.  A gatekeeper is an actor who controls
              access to valued relations and benefits from that control.  For example, the
              International Olympics Committee (the IOC) is the sole body with the authority
              to locate Olympic games.  Only if Olympic games are attracted will there be the
              lucrative businesses associated with them. IOC gatekeeps and there are recent
              reports that its members profit.  Though ordering effects can occur across many
              kinds of relations, exchange networks provide a well proven context for their
              investigation. Models for an array of orderings are developed. Using resistance
              equations, predictions for the models are generated and nine experiments are
              proposed.  These experiments are intended to demonstrate the effect of ordering
              on exchange ratios and to determine how ordering interacts with other
              structural power conditions.
