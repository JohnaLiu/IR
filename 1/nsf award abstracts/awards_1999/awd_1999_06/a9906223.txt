Abstract    :
              Researchers evaluate the role of neuromotor processes in predator-evasion by
              calanoid copepods.  These copepods are among the more numerous animals on
              earth, outnumbering even insects.  Despite their importance to oceanic
              ecosystems, critical understanding is missing on how these animals survive and,
              indeed, thrive in an ocean full of predators.  Investigators are examining, for
              instance, the rapid, forceful escape behavior in which copepods seem to 'jump'
              instantaneously away from an approaching predator.  They hypothesize that
              escape behavior exhibits distinctive variations among species, reflecting
              differences in survival strategies for animals inhabiting different
              environments in the ocean.  Differences in physiological and behavioral
              characteristics of escape triggered by minute water movements are being
              correlated with structural features seen in the nervious system, aided by an
              electron microscope.  Investigators are particularly interested in the presence
              or absence of "myelin," a protective sheathing around nerve cells.  Myelin
              speeds nerve impulse conduction, thus shortening reaction times.  Properties of
              the copepods' nervous systems are being related, too, to sensitivity to water
              movement, sensitivity to changes in light intensity (mimicking the shadow of a
              predator), reaction time, movement of appendages, energy production, response
              duration, swim speed and escape distance.  In sum, researchers are providing
              quantitative information on the copepod's nervous system's unusual sensory and
              physiological capabilities.
