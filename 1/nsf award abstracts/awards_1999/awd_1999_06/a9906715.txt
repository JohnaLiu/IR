Abstract    :
              	This award represents an interagency transfer of funds to reimburse the U.S.
              Navy for radiosondes provided to support two international field programs, the
              Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) and the Joint Air-Sea Monsoon Interaction
              Experiment (JASMINE), both funded in part by NSF.  The radiosondes are a
              critical part of the overall observing system in both experiments.
