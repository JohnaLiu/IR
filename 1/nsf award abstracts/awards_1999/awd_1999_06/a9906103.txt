Abstract    :
                   This grant provides partial funding for a conference titled Optimization in
              Industry.  The conference will be held from June 6-11, 1999, at Banff in
              Alberta, Canada.   Its goal is to bring together about 70 researchers from
              industry, university and Government both in the US and foreign nations.  The
              attendees will pool their knowledge and expertise towards furthering the use of
              optimization in industry, specifically as they relate to distributed design and
              manufacturing and the associated ramifications upon design theory and
              high-speed computing.   The objectives of the conference include facilitating
              in-depth discussions involving a review of fundamental work done in the field,
              assessing the present state of research and practice and thence identifying
              promising new and innovative activities that will lead to an increased use of
              optimization in industry.
     This conference should help the optimization
              research and practice communities identify elements of design theory that need
              to be developed to support distributed design with high-speed computing at its
              core and the development of optimization techniques of value to industry.  The
              successful use of such techniques by industry will result in better products at
              lower costs.
