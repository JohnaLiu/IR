Abstract    :
              The emergence of new populations of organizations represents an important source
              of social change. New types of organizations generate novel products, services,
              and working arrangements within societies. As a population grows, it takes on
              increasing importance, e.g., by employing more people, serving more customers,
              and creating more dependence on its outputs. Researchers in organizational
              sociology have long sought to understand how organizational populations emerge
              and evolve. This doctoral dissertation research addresses three critical
              questions: How does the environment within which a population of organizations
              is embedded affect its evolution? How do differences between organizations
              within a population affect their interaction? And how does organizational
              change affect survival and growth? These questions will be addressed through an
              analysis of the population of U.S. management consulting firms over its entire
              history, 1886-1997. Archival sources and interviews will be used to construct a
              longitudinal database containing organization-level data for each firm in each
              year. Hypotheses for the effects of entrepreneurs, environmental conditions,
              and major events on population evolution will be tested. The results will
              contribute to theory-building efforts in organizational sociology, as well as
              furnish a detailed analysis of an important population of organizations.
