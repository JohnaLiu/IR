              Abstract

This award  supports plans  to conduct a fine-resolution analysis of
              both pollen and charcoal, placing special emphasis on resolving the presence of
              a Younger Dryas style event at Lake Titicaca. To date, the most convincing
              evidence for a set of climatic oscillations that parallel  the  Bolling/Allerod
              and Younger Dryas of Europe and North Atlantic comes from the Sajama ice core,
              Bolivia. A site that lends itself to testing the Sajama record is the nearby 
              Lake Titicaca. Titicaca is an deep lake with ancient sediments, but one in
              which a hiatus at 16,000 to 9,000 years ago exists in all previous cores. Core
              NE98-1PC was raised from 170 m of water and contains  the  first  continuous
              sedimentary sequence covering  the  last 23,000 years. Other collaborators are
              working on a wide array  of proxies, and this proposal seeks funds to provide
              fossil pollen and charcoal data  for this core. These data would  provide  the 
              first continuous record of vegetation movement, fire,  and  inferred climate
              change from the Bolivian Altiplano.  Indeed,  they would become one of two or
              three continuous sedimentary records from the neotropics south of the equator
              that date to the glacial maximum.
