Abstract    :
              	It is planned to have a Workshop on the Study of Hadronic Structure using
              electron scattering with out-of-plane detection at the Bates Linear Accelerator
              Center in spring 2000. The primary focus will be the out-of-plane spectrometer
              system (OOPS) now under completion and scheduled to take data in 2000.  A
              highly rated program has been approved with OOPS including: study of the shape
              of the proton using the N -> Delta transition; investigation of the structure
              of the proton by measurement of virtual Compton scattering; and measurement of
              small-amplitude observables in the structure of the deuteron.
	The Workshop
              will take place at Bates and involve on the order of 5 theorists active in the
              programs listed above.  The group will include the following:  B. Holstein (U.
              Mass-Amherst), T.S.-H. Lee (Argonne), N. Mukopadhyah (RPI), M. Savage (UWash),
              R. Springer (Duke), members of their respective groups, the OOPS collaboration,
              the Bates User community, and the CTP including, T.W. Donnelly.  The Workshop
              will be advertised and open to the wider nuclear physics community.  An
              essential aspect will be to focus young theory students and post-docs on
              important problems relevant to the study of hadronic structure using the
              out-of-plane detection capabilities.
