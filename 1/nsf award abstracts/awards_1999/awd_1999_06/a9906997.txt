"Adaptation, Phylogenetic Inertia, and Trait Independence"


In
              recent years, a number of biologists have proposed methods for using
              comparative (cross-species) data to test adaptive hypotheses. The most widely
              used of these methods is Felsenstein's (1985) method of independent contrasts.
              One important objective of these methods is to control for the possibility of
              phylogenetic inertia -- to take account of the fact that closely related
              species may have similar traits, not because these traits are adaptive, but
              simply because they were inherited from a common ancestor (Harvey and Pagel
              1992). In this project, the Principal Investigators will evaluate these
              methods; they also will construct, justify, and apply a new method (which we
              call the method of controlled comparisons) that (they argue) avoids the defects
              found in existing methods. This task will require careful conceptual analyses
              of what phylogenetic inertia actually means and of how inertial hypotheses are
              related to optimality models. One analytic tool that they will use is the work
              by philosophers on probabilistic explications of the concept of cause (e.g.,
              Eells 1991). This project is part of the larger program of showing how
              adaptationism can be tested; it supplements the analysis in Orzack and Sober
              (1994a,b) of how optimality models should be tested by using within-species
              data.
