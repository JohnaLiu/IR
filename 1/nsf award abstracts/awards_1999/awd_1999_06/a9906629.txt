Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the collective aspect of decision-making on the
              United States Supreme Court, namely the development of joint opinions.  The PIs
              will produce a data base that documents the interaction among justices as
              opinions are written.  The database will catalog every action and decision of
              the justices between the assignment of the opinion and the public announcement
              of the Court's decision, drawing on resources found in the personal papers for
              the Burger Court (1969-1985).  Thus the data base will document every opinion
              draft that was circulated, as well as the author, recipients, date, and content
              of every memo transmitted, as well as the location of every such memo.
