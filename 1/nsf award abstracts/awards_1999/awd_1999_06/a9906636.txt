Abstract    :
              The proposed dissertation research documents the flow of sickle cell disease
              knowledge between Paris and Dakar. The conditions and constraints of sickle
              cell anemia in Senegal have prompted French-trained physicians at the Hopital
              Albert Royer in the Fann area of Dakar to question the universality of sickle
              cell patient care and treatment protocols as these have been established in the
              United States and France. Sickle cell disease in Atlantic Africa is known to
              correspond with a specific genetic variant (the Senegalese haplotype) which may
              be responsible for a less severe form of this disease. This project takes
              seriously a dialectic between culture and biology, by tracing the ways in which
              biological difference, geography and cultural values contribute to the
              modification of scientific and medical knowledge. Through interpretive social
              science methods based on interviews and participant-observation, the
              investigator will analyze the dynamic processes that allow for rethinking
              approaches to sickle cell care in Senegal and elsewhere.
