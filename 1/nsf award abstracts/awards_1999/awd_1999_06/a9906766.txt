This award funds a six-year continuing award
              for the second life cycle of the multi-university Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for Electronic Materials, Devices and Systems at
              the Texas A&M University (as lead), the University of Texas-Arlington and the
              University of North Texas.

The research activities of these three sites are
              complimentary and this operation will enable the Center to expand its research
              activities and enrich their industrial membership base.  This consolidation
              Center has expertise in bulk single and thin film growth, exceptional
              characterization and process modeling of electronic materials, Molecular Beam
              Epitaxy (MBE), and Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) for the production of
              multi-layer and heterostructure devices, rapid thermal processing, fabrication,
              and evaluation of devices (fiber-optic sensors, integrated optics,
              semiconductor lasers, microwave and millimeter wave circuits and devices,
              superconductor devices, ferroelectric devices and optical instrumentation),
              device modeling and simulation.
