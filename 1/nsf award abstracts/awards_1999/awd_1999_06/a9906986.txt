This grant provides salary support for two years for the
              mineral and rock physics laboratory (MRPL) technician at the University of
              Minnesota. An additional two years of support will be provided by the
              University of Minnesota following expiration of this award.  This is a Phase II
              technician support grant under the Instrumentation and Facilities (IF) Program
              and follows three years of Phase I support (EAR-9526239).  Phase I support for
              a technician for the MRPL under the direction of Profs. Karato and Kohlstedt
              contributed to the improved operation of the laboratory including training of
              graduate students, installation of new experimental facilities and maintenance
              and development of new experimental techniques. As a result, the MRPL is now
              capable of conducting a range of experimental studies including ultra-high
              pressure deformation, large strain shear deformation under high P-T conditions,
              experiments on kinetic properties under well-controlled thermodynamic
              conditions.  Continued support of this technical position will allow this group
              to expand collaborative research with outside investigators, and will permit
              the technician, Dr. Mark Zimmerman, to develop new experimental techniques such
              as deformation experiments under lower mantle conditions, and to install new
              facilities including controlled pore-fluid pressure in a gas-medium deformation
              apparatus.  All of the experimental facilities at the MRPL continue to be used
              extremely productively by Karato and Kohlstedt to improve our understanding of
              the rheology of deep mantle phases, the physical controls on seismic wave
              propagation through deep earth materials, and the relationship between melt
              distribution and rheology of oceanic lithosphere at spreading centers.
