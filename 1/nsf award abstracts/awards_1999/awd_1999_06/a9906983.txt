              Proposal #: 99-06983
Abstract: 
The PI's propose to develop an In Situ
              Spectrophotometer (ISUS) system that can operate throughout the ocean on
              moorings and CTD type profilers.  The instrument will be developed to measure
              the absorption of light in the ultraviolet region. In seawater, compounds of
              interest to oceanographers that absorb light at wavelengths less than 280 nm
              include nitrate, nitrite, bisulfide and bromide ions.  The PI's show that
              measurements of these compounds can be routinely made at the levels required
              for most oceanographic studies without chemical manipulations.  An ISUS system
              would be of enormous benefit for biogeochemical studies of nutrient cycling,
              hydrothermal systems and optical detection of the major ion bromide in areas
              where the conductivity-salinity relationship breaks down (e.g. in
              phase-separated hydrothermal fluids). This proposal is coordinated with a
              separate proposal to the NOAA/NURP program by H. Milburn and G. Massoth who
              will develop systems on the ALVIN submersible that will allow the PI's to
              deploy the instrument at hydrothermal vent sites.
