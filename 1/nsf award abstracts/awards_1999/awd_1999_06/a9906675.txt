A Multidisciplinary Workshop:
Self-Assembling Peptide Systems
              in Biology, Engineering and Medicine

A workshop on self-assembling peptide
              systems will be held from July 1 through 6, 1999 in Crete, Greece.  The purpose
              is to provide a forum for interaction between scientists from Biology,
              Engineering and Medicine to meet and exchange ideas and experiences on the
              study of peptide self-assembly.  While speakers are drawn internationally,
              their expertise ranges from protein/peptide chemistry, biotechnology, material
              science and medicine.  A number of these speakers are current NSF awardees. 
              Approximately 150 participants are expected, including graduate students and
              postdoctoral fellows. The workshop should have an impact on the promotion of
              further collaboration between disciplines and advancing the knowledge and
              application of this and related topic areas.
