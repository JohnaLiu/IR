This award provides partial support for two of the several
              mini-symposia to be presented during the first joint meeting of the BMES and
              the EMBS in Atlanta, Georgia, October 13-16, 1999.  Approximately 2,000 persons
              are expected to participate in the meeting.  The mini-symposia are Molecular
              and Cell Engineering, and Tissue Engineering.  The three speakers for each
              mini-symposium are younger investigators who are rapidly becoming leaders in
              their fields of inquiry.

The mini-symposia will describe the
              state-of-the-science and engineering in two important fields of biomedical
              engineering research and are expected to contribute to the development and
              maturation of new technologies with applications in medicine.  The proceedings
              of the Joint EMBS/BMES Meeting are to be published on CD-ROM.
