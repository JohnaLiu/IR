Title: Analysis of the
              Arctic Climate Oscillations

The proposed research will identify robust
              oscillations of the arctic climate, and identify major factors that maintain
              these oscillations. The interdependence of oceanic, sea ice, and atmospheric
              processes corresponding to major oscillations of the arctic climate will also
              be studied. The 300-year run of the NCAR CSM will be examined. The work is
              important because it will yield insights into arctic climate variability in the
              CSM, and recommend major directions for improvement.
