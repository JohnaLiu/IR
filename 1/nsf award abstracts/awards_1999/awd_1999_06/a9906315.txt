Abstract    :
              With support from the National Science Foundation's Innovation and
              Organizational Change Program, this study combines data modeling, scheduling
              approaches, and simulation modeling in developing and testing a decision
              support system for the management of new product portfolios. It would develop
              an integrated approach to managing new product development portfolios that
              links strategic planning, organizational processes, decision-making, risk
              assessment, and resource planning. 

Based on risk and strategic assessment,
              development process stages and resource capacity and scheduling, the
              researchers develop tools for portfolio prioritization. They incorporate an
              understanding of inter project linkages from technical, design architecture,
              and resource perspectives. Nortel, Lotus, Johnson & Johnson, the Concours
              Group, and Design Continuum are providing input to the case studies and
              simulation models. 

The research will help companies effectively manage new
              product development portfolios and more effectively plan and utilize capacity
              for the entire business.
