              ABSTRACT

OCE-9906089


Most organic matter is biologically synthesized in
              the form of high molecular-weight macromolecules such as proteins, lipid
              complexes, and polysaccharides, the vast majority eventually being
              remineralized to carbon dioxide.  Very little is known about the enzyme systems
              that mediate these important decomposition processes.  For this reason, the
              principal investigator proposes to develop a set of substrates that can be used
              to investigate the rate of hydrolysis and substrate specificities of
              extracellular enzymes involved in the remineralization of polysaccharides and
              carbohydrate-containing macromolecules in the marine water column and
              sediments.  It is expected that the macromolecular substrates developed in this
              project will expand our current ability to examine extracellular enzymatic
              hydrolysis processes as well as our knowledge of the structure of
              naturally-occurring organic macromolecules.
