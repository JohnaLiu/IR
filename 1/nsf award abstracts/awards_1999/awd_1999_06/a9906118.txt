This award supports a workshop to develop and offer a
              perspective on research in theoretical computer science.  This effort is in
              part a response to the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee
              (PITAC) Interim Report to the President.  A panel of 15 leading theoreticians
              in several research areas will convene in Chicago on March 11 and 12.  The
              result of the meeting will be a formal report.
