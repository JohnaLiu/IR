              ABSTRACT

OCE-9906922

The subtropical gyres occupy a large fraction of the
              world ocean and until recently, the common view was that these vast
              nutrient-depleted regions support only a small amount of primary productivity. 
              However, this view is changing and it appears that production in these areas is
              important.  Thus it is important to understand the mechanism by which nutrients
              are supplied to these areas.  To this end, this project will seek to improve
              estimates of the mechanisms of nutrient transport to the euphotic zone, and
              also better constrain the magnitude of the carbon pump.  The three main
              elements of this proposal are improvment in the continuous measurements of
              oxygen and N2 on the HOT mooring, ship-of-opportunity measurements of DOP
              (dissolved organic phosphorus) and DON (dissolved organic nitrogen), and
              measurements of neon to clarify the mechanism of bubble-induced gas exchange in
              the O2 budget.  The goal is to determine the quantitative importance of
              intermittment diapycnal and surface transport of phosphorus, and to improve
              mass balance estimates of net biological oxygen production.
