Abstract    :
              This project seeks fundamental information on the interactions between nitrogen
              (N) and phosphorus (P) in the oligotrophic North Pacific Ocean, and their
              relationships to rates and mechanisms of ecosystem production and export.  The
              research is guided by the following general hypothesis: "Climate-related shifts
              in the structure of the epipelagic habitat have selected for N2-fixing
              bacteria, resulting in a coupled intensification of N and P cycling rates which
              has forced the system from N- to P-limitation with numerous ecological and
              biogeochemical consequences.  This hypothesized shift from N- to P-limitation
              has affected community structure, rates of gross primary production and export,
              and the elemental (C, N, P) stoichiometry of dissolved and particulate matter
              pools.  The investigators will conduct a series of field and laboratory
              experiments designed to evaluate several ecological predictions of this coupled
              intensification model of nutrient dynamics in the North Pacific Subtropical
              Gyre with a primary focus on P pool dynamics.  The field research will be
              conducted at Sta. ALOHA (22 degrees 45'N, 158 degrees W) and will complement
              the ongoing Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) core measurement program.  These
              efforts will focus on: (1) dissolved inorganic P uptake and remineralization
              rates, (2) dissolved organic P pool production rates, chemical
              characterizations and bioavailability and (3) physiological and biochemical
              assessments of Trichodesmium and Prochlorococcus.  Knowledge derived from this
              project will be used to refine our understanding of the oligotrophic North
              Pacific ecosystem and to predict the response of oceanic habitats to
              environmental variability and global climate change.
