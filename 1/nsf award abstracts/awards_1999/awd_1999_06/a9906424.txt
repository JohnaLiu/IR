Abstract    :
              The inner ear of vertebrates is a complex labyrinth of fluid-filled canals,
              pouches and ducts encased in bone.  These organs contain sensory hair cells and
              supporting cells, and  aid in balance and movement control, with some parts
              specialized for hearing, as in the cochlea of mammals.  This complex 
              three-dimensional structure arises during embryonic development from a
              thickened flat patch called a placode on the side of the head.  It is unclear
              what genes are involved in the developmental program for these precisely
              'engineered' tubes and pouches from this originally simple patch of skin. 
              Preliminary results suggest that there are important interactions between two
              proteins, one called 'bone-morphogenetic protein #4' (BMP4) and the other
              called 'noggin' that may act as an antagonistic pair of regulators for
              patterning.  This project utilizes anatomical, genetic and molecular biology
              along with novel microsurgical techniques to implant tiny beads containing the
              protein-expressing cells directly in the developing ear.  Results will clarify
              how genetic expression of particular proteins can shape the morphology of a
              complex sensory organ.  This work will have an impact in several areas of
              neuroscience, and the project also will provide multidisciplinary training for
              students.
