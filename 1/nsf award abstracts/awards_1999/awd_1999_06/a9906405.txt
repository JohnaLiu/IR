Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop the experimental methodologies to
              engineer synthetic novel operons for coordinated expression of multiple genes
              in bacteria.  The specific aims are: (1) to develop a dual-gene expression
              system that allows for convenient insertion of hairpins, RNase cleavage sites,
              and genes; 
(2) to design synthetic hairpins to be used to stabilize one or
              more coding regions of an operon; (3) to confirm that the synthetic inserts
              form the structures predicted by RNA folding algorithms; (4) to test the
              effects of hairpin strength and endoribonuclease cleavage site location, and
              gene location in an operon on mRNA stability and protein production; (5) to
              test the effect of RNase E sites in the genes and RNase III sites in the
              
hairpins on the stability of the transcript for these genes; and (6) to test
              the synthetic operon with a dual-enzyme metabolic pathway that has an easily
              assayable intermediate.
