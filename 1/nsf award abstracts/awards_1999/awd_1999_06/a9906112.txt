Abstract    :
                   This grant provides funding for 20 students from U.S. colleges and
              universities to travel to the International Electronics Manufacturing
              Technology Symposium, which will be held in Austin, Texas, in October 1999. 
              The 3-day conference is attended by approximately 200 academics and engineering
              professionals, and is a forum for discussing new work in the area of
              semiconductor and packaging processes and products.  Specific topics in past
              years have included Flip Chip and Ball Grid Array packaging, board level
              assembly, interconnect developments, reliability and test, environmentally
              conscious manufacturing, semiconductor processing developments, manufacturing
              process and product improvement, simulation and modeling, and emerging
              technologies in electronics manufacturing.  The availability of travel grants
              will be announced through the conference advance literature, and by university
              professors who are on the conference committee.  Travel grants will be awarded
              to students based on their subject area of study, their seniority and the
              distance of travel to the conference.   The success of the program will be
              tracked through the attendance statistics collected by the conference
              organizers, and evaluated during the following year.  
     The goal of the
              project is to expose more students to current, real-world issues in the field
              of electronics manufacturing.  Students will have an opportunity to discover
              topics that interest them, to compare their own work with that being presented
              at a technical conference, and to network with professionals and academics from
              other institutions.  The availability of grants is also expected to increase
              the number of student presentations in future years.
