Abstract    :
              The first goal of this project is to collect a third wave of data in an ongoing
              panel study of the 804 adult members of 60 communal households. They were first
              interviewed in 1974-'75 and reinterviewed in 1986-'87. The second goal is to
              begin the process of moving this unique data set into the public domain. On the
              most basic level, this three wave data set will permit the study of reciprocal
              effects of belief systems and relational networks over time. It also will allow
              researchers to contextualize these effects in terms of changing conditions of
              group membership and the presence or absence of charismatic leadership.
              Substantively, there are four objectives. (1) To study the persistence of
              unconventional beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors; (2) to determine the extent
              of, and factors related to, the persistence over time of networks of dyadic
              relationships; (3) to investigate the ways in which attachment to shared
              beliefs affects the network of relational ties, and the ways in which the
              network of relational ties affects attachment to shared beliefs; and (4) to
              determine whether the association between beliefs and social relationships is
              different in the communes that had charismatic leaders than in the
              non-charismatic communes in our study. These results bear on such fundamental
              theoretical matters as the decay trajectories of relational networks and
              systems of belief over long periods of time, how these interact with one
              another and how they are influenced by organizational affiliations, leadership,
              and life events.
