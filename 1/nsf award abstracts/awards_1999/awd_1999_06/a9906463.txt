Abstract    :
              This cooperative agreement continues to operate the Wyoming King air as a
              national facility.  The King Air aircraft facility is a unique facility that
              provides a platform for observational science and education for the NSF
              supported scientific community and the geosciences community in general.  The
              aircraft would be maintained in a flight ready condition to support NSF
              approved atmospheric research projects that require the capability of the
              twin-engine turboprop.  The agreement provides base funding for the management,
              staffing, operation, maintenance, testing and some enhancements of the King Air
              aircraft and instrumentation.  It covers both the scientific and technical
              support for planning and data reduction phases of field projects.  The
              agreement will also include the deployment of the facility under supplemental
              awards from the NSF's  lower atmospheric research facilities deployment pool
              funding.  The aircraft has been operated as an NSF national facility since
              December 1987.  The facility has flown on average about five to six field
              programs per year.  During its lifetime (since 1977) the aircraft has flown
              over 3000 research flight hours, of which about 1800 have been devoted to NSF
              sponsored scientists.  There is no current suitable replacement aircraft that
              could perform the same type of data collection for NSF-sponsored research.
