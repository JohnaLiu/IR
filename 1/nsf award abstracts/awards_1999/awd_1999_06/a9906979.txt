Faculty from the Schools of Physical Sciences (Chemistry,
              Physics) and of Engineering at the University of California-Irvine establish an
              interdisciplinary summer program for graduate students.  The program is aimed
              at incoming students with undergraduate backgrounds in physics, chemistry,
              materials science and engineering, and it includes interdisciplinary courses
              and hands-on laboratory experiences.

The overall objective of this program
              is to enhance the graduate school experience by offering students formal
              training in areas related to their discipline.  This training is not normally
              part of a departmental curriculum; thus the program adds breadth to the
              traditional disciplinary graduate education.  This award is funded by the
              Divisions of Materials Research and of Chemistry, and by the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences
