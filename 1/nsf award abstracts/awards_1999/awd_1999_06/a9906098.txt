Abstract    :
              This SGER project will lay the groundwork for building classroom
assessment
              tools for secondary science teachers and students in the State
of Washington. 
               The investigators will identify the particular
understandings of physical
              science concepts, processes, and nature of
science for students in grades 6
              through 10.  Approximately 200 facets of
students thinking will be identified
              by reviewing existing research on
students conceptions and by conducting
              research in several school
districts across the state. Minstrell's Facets of
              Thinking framework can
be used to write questions for diagnosing specific
              problematic
understandings and for designing instruction that targets
              these
understandings.  The facets perspective has made substantial
              and
significant changes for about thirty high school teachers of
              physics.
This project is to begin scaling-up that perspective to serve about
              2000
science teachers and upwards to 400,000 secondary students each
              year.
Results of the project will be used during fall of 2000 by the state
              to
revise the official version of Washington State Science Assessments
              which
has been legislated for grades 8 and 10.  The project will also inform
              a
next round of projects that will create classroom, diagnostic tools
              for
assessment and teaching in the service of better learning. (Please
