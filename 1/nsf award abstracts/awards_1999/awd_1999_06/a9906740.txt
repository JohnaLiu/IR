This project addresses the questions: What do the
              Inuit know about climate and climate change and how do they construct this
              knowledge?  How can Inuit climate knowledge and scientific research be
              integrated to further understand Arctic climate processes and the potential
              impacts of change on the Arctic environment and human settlements?  A
              multi-method approach, using content analysis, charting with map overlays,
              open-ended interviews, and participant observation, will be used to document
              Inuit climate knowledge.  Scientific record and Inuit testimony will be matched
              regarding climate and ice anomalies in the Eastern Canadian Arctic.  Elders and
              hunters at four settlements (and local hunting camps) will work with the co-PI
              to interpret Inuit climate knowledge.  Information collected will be used to
              develop a model that includes appropriate methods for data sharing and
              knowledge dissemination.
