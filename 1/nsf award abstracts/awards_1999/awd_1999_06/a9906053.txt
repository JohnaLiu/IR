In this proposal, we will study both theoretically and
              experimentally several cathodes and photocathodes fabricated using GaAs and
              JnP-based materials activated to NEA with NdS and LaS surfaces, respectively.
              Our ultimate goal is to build prototypes of (1) InP/LaS and GaAs/NdS Schottky
              barrier transferred electron photoemitters, (2) cold cathodes based on pn GaAs
              and ImP diodes, (3) JnP/InAlAs and AlGaAs/GaAs cold cathode and photocathode
              heterojunctions, and (4) GaAsP/GaAs and InP/InAlAs polarized electron
              sources.

Our research effort will consist of a three-year project between
              the University of Cincinnati (LaS and NdS growth and characterization and
              device fabrication), Uppsala University (Electronic Structure Calculations),
              Ovation Semiconductor in Rochester (MN) (MBE growth of III-V heterostructures),
              Sarnoff Corporation (NJ) (electrical testing of the cathodes), and the Stanford
              Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) (test of devices as efficient polarized
              electron sources).

The cold cathodes and photocathodes to be developed in
              this program could lead to a billion dollar industry due to their wide range of
              applications including fiat panel displays, photomultipliers, pressure sensors,
              high-temperature or radiation tolerant sensors, vacuum transistors, and high
              power microwave tubes. Simultaneously, polarized electron sources find
              applications in fundamental research in solid state, atomic and high energy
              physics.
