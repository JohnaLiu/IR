In this project, the PIs will investigate the mechanisms of
              secondary circulation in stratified esturaries, and quantify their
              contributions to vertical momentum and salt transport and horizontal
              dispersion.  Observations in the stratified Hudson River estuary indicate
              complex secondary flows that strongly influence the transverse density
              structure and may be major contributors to vertical momentum flux.  Secondary
              circulations, known to have a dominant influence on lateral exchange and
              longitudinal dispersion in estuaries, have only been studied in well-mixed
              environments.  A three-dimensional, numerical model will be used for both
              idealized and realistic simulations, the former focused on isolating particular
              mechanisms, and the latter applied to the lower Hudson estuary, for which a
              large array of data is available.
