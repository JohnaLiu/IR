Abstract    :
              Organic compounds play an important role in numerous chemical, physical, and
              biological processes during circulation of seawater-derived hydrothermal fluids
              through the crust at mid-ocean ridges. Despite their importance, the abundance
              and composition of aqueous organic species in hydrothermal fluids from
              sedimented and unsedimented axial hot-spring systems are presently unknown.
              During this study, hydrothermal fluids will be sampled at the Endeavour and
              Middle Valley hydrothermal fields, northern Juan de Fuca ridge using a newly
              designed gas-tight fluid sampler and the submersible Alvin. The new sampler
              allows the abundance of both volatile and non-volatile aqueous species to be
              determined quantitatively in a single fluid sample. Fluids will be analyzed
              quantitatively for a broad spectrum of aqueous organic and inorganic species to
              fully characterize subsurface chemical environments and  constrain the extent
              of organic-inorganic chemical interaction. The results will lead to an
              increased understanding of factors that regulate the generation and destruction
              of organic species in hydrothermal systems and allow evaluation of a broad
              spectrum of biogeochemical processes such as crustal alteration, mobilization
              of ore-forming metals, the flux of carbon from the oceanic crust to the water
              column, the availability of nutrients to support a subsurface biosphere,  and
              the abiotic synthesis of organic compounds that may represent precursors to
              life.
