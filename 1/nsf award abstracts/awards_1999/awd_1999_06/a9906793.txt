Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigators will compile digital mosaics of historical satellite
              data acquired during the early 1960s over the Greenland Ice Sheet.  These data
              were acquired as part of the Argon project and were recently declassifed for
              use by the science community.  They are applicable to geological and
              glaciological studies of remote parts of the Earth and particularly to the
              polar regions.  They will attempt to acquire all historical satellite imagery
              collected over Greenland from 1962-1964.  They will orthorectify each image
              using knowledge of the satellite position, available  Digital Elevation Model
              (DEMS), and  available ground control.  At least two digital mosaics covering
              all of Greenland will be compiled from the orthorectified data.  The mosaic
              will be distributed to other users as a CDROM.  Access to individual
              orthorectified will be made through a web-based catalogue and browser.  The
              completed mosaics will be compared to each other and to more recently compiled
              image maps of Greenland.  The result will be used to study changes in the ice
              sheet margin, calving front of coastal glaciers, ice sheet motion and
              dynamics.
