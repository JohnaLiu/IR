	This award provides partial funding support for the
              operation and maintenance of the GeoSoilEnviroCARS (GSECARS; CARS = Consortium
              for Advanced Radiation Sources). GSECARS is located at the Advanced Photon
              Source (APS) in Argonne National Laboratory. The APS is a synchrotron
              electron/positron storage ring used to generate brilliant X-radiation for
              materials research. GSECARS operates two X-ray beamlines used primarily for
              applications in the earth sciences. The research conducted at GSECARS makes use
              of the capabilities of brilliant, highly collimated, X-ray beams to advance
              knowledge of the composition, structure, and properties of earth materials.
              Specific techniques employed by GSECARS users include: (1)
              high-pressure/temperature crystallography of samples in a diamond anvil cell or
              in a multi-anvil large volume press; (2) powder, single crystal, and interface
              diffraction techniques; (3) X-ray absorption fine structure analysis (XAFS);
              (4) X-ray fluorescence microprobe analysis, and; (5) X-ray computer assisted
              microtomography.
