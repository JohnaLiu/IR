Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to quantify the metabolic consequences of
              tryptophan overproduction upon central carbon metabolism and indole alkaloid
              pathways in Catharanthus roseus hairy root tissue cultures.  This research has
              four objectives which include: (1) the generation of transgenic C. roseus hairy
              
root clones that overexpress anthranilate synthase and tryptophan
              decarboxylase; (2) the characterization of the above strains in terms of
              growth, nutrient levels, amino acid pools, and indole alkaloid accumulation;
              (3) the mathematical analysis of intracellular fluxes; and (4) the measurement
              of intracellular fluxes using new in vitro 13 C NMR techniques.
