The purpose of this proposal is to support a team of U.S.
              engineering educators for participating in the International Conference on
              Engineering Education, ICEE-99 in Ostrava, Czech Republic.  The participation
              in this conference will strengthen the collaborations that nucleated during
              ICEE 97(Chicago) and ICEE 98 (Rio de Janeiro) and accompanying international
              workshops.  Consistent with the commitment made last year by Taiwan, Brazil and
              the Czech Republic, this team will constitute the U.S. delegation to ICEE 99
              and the follow on International Workshop.  A secondary purpose of this proposal
              is to support dissemination of the curriculum reform philosophy beyond the U.S.
              by targeted participation in ICEE 99.  This will be accomplished through key
              presentations, the conducting of workshops, and participation in symposia and
              panel discussions.  The availability of a travel grant from the NSF will enable
              the participation of faculty members from underrepresented groups.
