Abstract    :
              This work will test the following hypotheses:  (1) Pacific hotspot trails
              reflect several second-order changes in absolute plate motion that can be
              correlated among the long-lived hotspot chains, (2) the times of absolute plate
              motion changes correlate with changes in relative plate motion, which seem to
              have been precipitated by circum-Pacific tectonic events, so times of relative
              plate motion changes can constrain absolute plate motion models; and (3) 
              absolute plate motion changes may trigger not-spot intraplate volcanism that
              will contaminate the age-progressive hotspot trail data set.  A detailed model
              for the Pacific absolute plate motion back to 65 Ma will be developed.
