Abstract    :
              In March-April 1998, the fastest seafloor spreading system, the East Pacific
              Rise between the Easter and Juan Fernandez microplates was surveyed during a
              multidisciplinary geophysical/geochemical expedition. Data collected included
              tows with the DSL-120 kHzsidescan sonar system and tow-yos and vertical casts
              during the CTD/SUAVE rosette, and co-registered geophysical and geochemical
              data by mounting the SUAVE in situ chemical analyzer on the DSL-120 depressor
              weight.  This grant will provide funds for reprocessing, analysis, and
              publication of the DSL-120 sidescan and bathymetry data.
