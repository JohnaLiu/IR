Title: The
              Application of Tree-Ring Analysis to Reconstruct the Drought/Hydro-Climatic
              History of the West African Sahel

This study will explore the feasibility of
              using tree-ring analysis to extend the rainfall and runoff records and the time
              series of drought episodes in the Sahel of West Africa.  Suitable woody plants
              species in the region will: Either form distinct annual rings, or contain other
              chronological markers that can be connected to external events of known date,
              Be found, either in the field, or in human artifacts, extending back into the
              preinstrumental period, Yield evidence, such as crossdating between growth
              rings in neighboring plants and those at more than one location, of a climate
              signal in the wood.  The availability of these records will greatly enhance the
              capability to study decadal to multidecadal features of climate variability.  
              The record of the major 1968-89 drought stands as stark testimony to the
              importance of such features in Sahelian climate.  These records also complement
              the relatively small set of high-resolution proxy records currently available
              from the Tropics in general, and from Africa as a whole.
