Abstract    :
                 During development, different proteins are expressed by cells as different
              genes within those cells are turned on and off.  Understanding such gene
              regulation is crucial for understanding developmental mechanisms.   The
              developing brain is particularly complex, forming highly specific connections,
              and having whole groups of cells migrate through other cells to form discrete
              layers.  Such activity depends in part on proteins responsible for cellular
              recognition and guidance.   This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
              exploits new molecular technology for a novel approach to regulating gene
              'knockdown.'  By injecting compounds called oligonucleotides directly into
              relevant regions, particular genes in a local area and at a particular time may
              be prevented from normal protein expression.  If successful, this new technique
              has great advantages of simplicity and specificity, not requiring creation or
              maintenance of stocks of transgenic or mutant animals. 
   The potential
              impact of this novel approach is to provide a relatively cheap and rapid
              approach for analysis of molecular aspects of brain development.  Its impact
              will also extend beyond developmental neuroscience to many areas of biology
              where issues of gene regulation are important.
