Abstract    :
              Motivated by field observations which demonstrate the importance of
              atmosphere-aerosol and atmosphere-surface interactions to the polar
              troposphere, two sets of heterogeneous chemistry laboratory experiments
              involving ice and seawater substrates will be performed. First, to identify the
              source of troposheric active bromine, processes which liberate bromide from
              frozen seawater will be studied. Reactive uptake coefficients of gas-phase
              molecules capable of oxidizing bromide, including hypobromous acid,
              hypochlorous acid, chlorine and ozone, will be measured from 233 to 258 K in a
              flow tube which has its inner walls coated with frozen artificial seawater
              solutions. The goal from these experiments is to assess the relative
              efficiencies of these molecules to oxidize bromide. Motivated by the
              possibility of autocatalytic bromide oxidation, the yield of bromine chloride
              and bromine from artificial seawater solutions which are exposed to hypobromous
              acid will be determined.  The second focus will be upon measuring the surface
              coverages of nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde on ice surfaces
              over the same temperature range. Previous laboratory studies have been
              performed at substantially lower temperatures, motivated by polar stratospheric
              cloud chemistry. The goal of this project is to investigate the chemistry at
              the temperatures where gases are scavenged in the boundary layer by ice
              aerosols and the ice surface, and to better understand the atmosphere-ice
              transfer function which determines the chemical composition of ice cores.
