Intelligent Anthropomorphic Soft Contact Surface Technology with MEMS
              in Robotics and Human Augmented Systems

This is the first year funding of a
              three year continuing award. The objectives of this research are to develop the
              framework of the smart anthropomorphic contact surface technology (SACST) based
              upon robotics theories, to employ MEMS devices in the framework as a
              distributed system, to integrate the sensory information for feedback
and
              control to impart intelligence, and to implement the framework on a prototype
              system.  The success of this research has potential to revolutionize the way we
              design and use seats, beds, wheelchair, shoes, and artificial skin for robot
              arms in the future.  SACST
utilizes the soft contact model, which subsumes the
              well-known Hertzian contact model initially developed in 1882, normal force and
              pressure distribution at the contact interface, friction limit surface, and
              stiffness of contact to dynamically reshape the surface through embedded MEMS
              transducer systems in real time.  Such design
can also implement dynamic
              functions such as massage or tilting of contact surfaces.  SACST framework will
              be employed to develop an in-depth understanding of science and engineering
              principles, as well as the control of the contact behaviors.  Thus, the
              framework will free up users from such lower level tasks in order that they
              can
concentrate on higher level tasks.  For example, if such surface is
              implemented in wheelchair design, the user of the chair will be able to focus
              on high level maneuvering without worrying about the details of empowering
              intelligence to the seating system.  A prototype system will be implemented
              based on the SACST framework.
