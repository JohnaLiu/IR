This project will explore how judicious use of noise can
              improve computation in select information and physical systems.   The launching
              point for this project is the principal  investigator's recent proof that may
              nonlinear dynamical systems con adaptively achieve a noise-based "stochastic
              resonance" where external noise improves the system signal-to-noise ratio or
              other performance measure.   The project will explore the nature of noise and
              how it affects many feedback (and perhaps feedforward) systems.  

The
              technical basis for this project rests on three claims:

1. Noise can
              sometimes help computation: New research in "stochastic resonance" and
              elsewhere show that noise can help computation as well as hurt it;
2. Noise is
              a free and local source of energy: Noise occurs at all scales in the universe
              and affects all physical systems involved in computation;
3. Noise computation
              promises new algorithms and computational techniques: Signal "crosstalk" is a
              common source of noise in communication, biological, neural, financial, optical
              and many other systems.  The proposed research will explore many of these
              natural and engineering systems and attempt either to optimize the signal
              structure to best fit the noise benefits of the background crosstalk or to
              optimize or to at least shape the background crosstalk structure to best fit
              the signals that pass through it.
