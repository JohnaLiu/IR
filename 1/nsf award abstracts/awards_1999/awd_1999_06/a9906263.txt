Description:  This award supports the US-India
              Cooperative Research: Mixing in Multiphase Opaque Systems--Modeling and
              Experimental Verification.  US PI Milorad Dudukovic, Washington University,
              Missouri will collaborate with Vivek Ranade, National Chemical Laboratory
              (NCL), Pune to conduct research on fluid flow and mixing in multiphase systems.
              The rate of mixing achievable in such systems is the key to the quality of
              products made by chemical reactions.  Dudukovic's laboratory is a world leader
              in the study of gas-liquid flow and modeling of bubbling columns.  Ranade's
              group at NCL is well known for its innovative multiphase flow models that have
              the potential for industrial applications.  The results of this joint effort
              could significantly enhance the state-of-the-art in this important field and
              allow applications in many industries.  

Scope:  Multiphase opaque systems
              are widely used in chemical and petroleum processing, materials' synthesis,
              food processing, pharmaceuticals production, and other industrial settings. 
              The research groups compliment one another and each group has strong domestic
              support for their research.  This collaboration will allow the investigators to
              establish an exchange of information, which will greatly enhance the value of
              the research.  The project has clear mutual benefits for the US and India, as
              well as potential for industrial application.
