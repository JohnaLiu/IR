Abstract    :
              This dissertation project addresses law, medicine and gender in colonial India.
              The chief objective is to contribute to understanding of the impact of British
              colonial law on Indian society. Specifically, the project focuses on the
              codification of British criminal law and on cases involving crimes against
              women in the province of Punjab, 1860-1947. To pursue this objective, through
              archival research and close historical analysis of court records, three lines
              of inquiry will be pursued: (1) why did the British become involved in
              prosecuting crimes against women when, since the 18th century, such matters had
              by colonial design been considered private indigenous legal matters?; (2) what
              role did Western medical jurisprudence play in the practice of colonial
              criminal law in terms of the standards used by the courts to interpret witness
              testimony and other evidence?; (3) how did the introduction of a uniform
              criminal code and a shifting notion of public order require the renegotiation
              and reconstitution of prior bodies of law, such as religious law and customary
              law? This research, which will be conducted in Lahore (Pakistan), New Delhi
              (India), and London (England) will have implications for understanding the
              present-day practice of law in South Asia as well as in other post-colonial
              societies where ongoing debates continue to rage about religious law and
              customary law and their discriminatory effects on women.
