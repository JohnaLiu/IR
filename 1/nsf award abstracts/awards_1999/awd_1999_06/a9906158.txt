Abstract    :
              This project examines how political and legal institutions shape corporate
              governance in the United States and Germany through the allocation of economic
              power and legal authority within the corporation. The research develops a
              political economic model of corporate governance as a tripartite structure
              comprised of company law, financial market regulation, and labor law, and
              compares the political, regulatory, and economic dynamics of change and
              stability in the American and German corporate governance regimes. The focus is
              on how the political and legal structures of these economies have responded to
              enormous changes in international financial markets, while accommodating
              different social values in their governance institutions. The project focuses
              on three central aspects of governance: (1) comparative regulatory politics;
              (2) labor and employee interests; and (3) the roles and interests of
              institutional investors.  Detailed qualitative research will involve a set of
              case studies of governance in American and German corporations. This
              description and analysis of the "law in action" will fill a significant gap in
              the corporate governance literature, which has tended to emphasize formal
              economic and legal models.  By focusing on how corporate actors shape and
              respond to legal and economic influences, the research places policy issues of
              governance reform in the political and institutional context in which they must
              be addressed.
