Abstract    :
              The long term goal of the proposed work is to determine the contributions the
              major input pathways to extrastriate regions of cerebral cortex make to visual
              perception and cognition.  The two major input pathways are: 1) the geniculate
              pathway, which transmits visual signals to the thalamus and then primary visual
              cortex, in order to gain entry to extrastriate cortex, and 2) the midbrain
              pathway, which transmits signals to the midbrain and then the thalamus, in
              order to gain entry to extrastriate cortex.  The present study is designed to
              evaluate the contributions of the midbrain pathway.  To make this evaluation,
              cooling loops, which induce localized hypothermia, will be placed in contact
              with the midbrain to effect temporary deactivation.  The contribution to visual
              processing will be
assessed with a battery of perceptual, cognitive, mnemonic
              and reflexive tasks which require a behavioral response.
Identification of
              specific deactivation-induced deficits in behavior will link the midbrain
              pathway to specific visual functions. Thus, the results obtained will broaden
              our understanding of "divisions of labor" in the brain.  Division of labor is
              likely to be a general principal of brain function because many sensory systems
              are comprised of
multiple parallel pathways just like those comprising the
              visual system. Each of the pathways is likely to be highly specialized for
              particular functions, rather than omponents in multiple redundant pathways.
