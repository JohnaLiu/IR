Abstract    :
              	This award provides partial support for the Verner E. Suomi Symposium, which
              will be held in conjunction with the 10th AMS Conference on Atmospheric
              Radiation, June 27 - July 2, 1999 in Madison, Wisconsin.  The symposium honors
              the late Professor Suomi, a pioneer in many areas of earth and space science
              and particularly in remote sensing from satellites.  The symposium will review
              the current state of the art and identify future challenges in remote sensing. 
               Plans include publishing the proceeding of the conference and symposium in the
              Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.  It is hoped that the
              symposium will serve as the catalyst for innovative ideas, much as Professor
              Suomi was a catalyst for the science.

	NSF is one of several federal
              agencies providing support for this symposium.
