Abstract    :
              In partnership with three Massachusetts school districts (Boston, Somerville,
              and Brookline), a large-scale collaborative project will be implemented and
              disseminated that intervenes with middle-school girls before they have chosen
              or ruled out possible futures for themselves.  It will link middle-school girls
              with high-school girls in their districts who have stayed interested in
              mathematics and science and with women who utilize science, mathematics,
              engineering, and technology in their careers.  The project will provide
              enriched science experiences, affective and academic support, and a broader
              knowledge of possible futures in high school and careers.  After-school
              programs will be implemented at which middle-school girls will communicate with
              mentors and engage in SMET investigations and will include teacher enhancement.
               Seven hundred middle-school students will be involved as well as 230
              high-school students, 300 teachers, and 230 women mentors from the community.
