This award is for support of a U.S.-NIS (Newly
              Independent States) workshop on neurocomputing opportunities.  The workshop
              will convene leading researchers in the field of neural network research from
              the U.S. and the NIS.  Soviet science launched a large program of neural
              bionics in the early 1980s.  However, because of the dissolution of the USSR,
              scientists in the newly independent states have had few chances to meet with
              the international community.  The goal of this workshop is to bring together
              U.S. and NIS researchers to identify one or more research topics where joint
              efforts could be mutually beneficial.  The workshop will be organized by Dr.
              Donald C. Wunsch of Texas Tech University, and Professor Alexander Gorban',
              Associate Director of the Institute of Computational Modeling, Krasnoyarsk,
              Russia.

This research in electrical engineering fulfills the program
              objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and NIS to combine
              complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
              benefit.
