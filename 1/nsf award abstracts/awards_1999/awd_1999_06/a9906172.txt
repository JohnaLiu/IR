Abstract    :
              With support from the National Science Foundation's Innovation and
              Organizational Change Program, this pilot study will examine the role of 
              organizational hope and positive affect in organizations undergoing major
              change.
Building on McClelland's work on motivation, Adler's work on intense
              loyalty and commitment as well as empirical  work from nursing and clinical
              psychology, the researchers will operationalize the concepts and develop a
              broad theoritical framework to guide the empirical work.

They will study
              high performing and low performing organizations undergoing change.  The
              outcome of this process will be a rich description of and operationalization of
              the concepts that will serve as the basis for further study.
