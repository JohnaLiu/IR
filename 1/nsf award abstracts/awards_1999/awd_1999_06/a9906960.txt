Abstract    :
              In 1978, in response to a rise in petroleum costs from $10 to $50 a barrel, the
              U.S. Congress passed the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA) to
              encourage power production by non-utilities using alternative energy sources
              and technology. Virtually overnight, PURPA created a new sector of the power
              industry by requiring existing utilities to buy electricity from qualifying
              facilities (QFs) which, by 1992, generated 10 percent of the electricity in the
              U.S. This doctoral dissertation research project proposes to analyze the
              ensuing development of this newly created niche using both qualitative methods
              and empirical analyses of a large database. Relatively few studies focus on
              resource spaces (niches) in their initial stages. This study explores the
              reciprocal effects of micro (individual) and macro (regulative and
              technological structures) variables and how they shape niche development. These
              concepts are operationalized by an examination of foundings of QFs between 1980
              and 1992 and the various micro (entrepreneurial values, social networks, and
              professional background) and macro (evolving norms and regulation) influences
              on both the number and organizational form of QFs founded.
