Description: This award is for the support of a joint
              project by Dr. Allan R. Robinson, Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences,
              Harvard University and Dr. Sukru Besiktepe, Institute of Marine Sciences at
              Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.  The project is to develop an
              operational nowcasting and forecasting capability of physical and
              biogeochemical variabilities of the Black Sea and to demonstrate the real-time
              forecast at sea.   They plan to set up the Harvard Ocean Prediction System
              (HOPS) as a "Black Sea Ocean Prediction System" (BOPS) and methodically follow
              procedures described by Robinson (1966) and by Lozano (1996).  The research
              plan includes the following tasks: create future model for biogeochemical
              variables (NO3, NH4, Detritus, Phytoplankton, Zooplankton), design ecosystem
              model representing lower trophic level of pelagic ecosystem, validate and
              calibrate ecosystem model using 1-d model of the Black Sea, couple the
              biochemical model with the physical model developed in previous studies,
              initialize and validate coupled physical-biochemical model, and prepare a
              system for real-time simulations, and perform on board forecasting of physical
              and biochemical variables.

Scope:  This award will support a joint project
              by two scientists who have complementary capabilities and facilities to study
              the important topic of the environmental monitoring of the Black Sea.  The
              problem of coupling physical oceanographic data with biogeochemical
              oceanographic data is crucial for the success of a forecasting model and will
              be dealt with in this cooperative project.  The US side has special models for
              physical oceanography phenomena, while the Turkish side has expertise in the
              Black Sea physical and environmental conditions and access to recent and
              current data.  The project fits well within the objectives of the Division of
              International Programs.
