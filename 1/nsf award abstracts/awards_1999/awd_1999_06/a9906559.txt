This Small Grants for
              Exploratory Research (SGER) project, will enable deployment of a MITESS
              12-position 0.5-liter automated seawater sampling system on an Arctic
              mooring-of-opportunity for twelve months.  The overall objective is to
              demonstrate the viability of year-round moored automated water sampling under
              Arctic conditions. No such system has been previously adapted for Arctic
              deployment, even though data paucity presently limits understanding many Arctic
              biogeochemical and circulation issues. Application of moored automated
              water-sampling devices represents a new approach to an established research
              gap.  Testing the moored sampling system now is timely in order to address
              objectives of the upcoming field program of Shelf Basin Interactions (SBI)
              initiative to begin in 2001
