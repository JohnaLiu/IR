Abstract    :
                 Although intervention programs and new teaching methods have helped to close
              the gender gap in mathematics achievement and course taking, they have had much
              less effect on influencing girls' decisions about pursuing math-related college
              majors and careers (Campbell, 1995).  Moreover, there is substantial evidence
              that among girls, those from African-American, Latino, Native American or
              low-income backgrounds are in particular need of support and encouragement in
              this domain (College Board, 1997; see also Phillips, 1998).  U-M GIRL is an
              intervention program that addresses this problem by innovative, integrated
              math/social scientific research projects.  U-M GIRL builds in structure and
              support for the girls' gains in mathematics and technology by involving in the
              intervention program two of  their key teachers for the following year.  U-M
              GIRL is also a professional development program that aims to make the tools and
              strategies of the intervention program available to teachers to use in their
              home classrooms.  By including teachers in all aspects of the program, the
              impact of the intervention is multiplied to include the students in the
              teachers' classes in the following year -- and beyond!
   The planning grant
              is based on findings of a pilot program, conducted in three middle schools in
              Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The Institute of Research on Women and Gender at the
              University of Michigan will build a collaborative effort with additional school
              districts in Michigan, beginning with Ypsilanti and Detroit.
