The PIs propose a collaborative project to develop a
              better understanding of the nature of strong and highly variable seismic
              anisotropy in the D'' layer at the base of Earth's mantle.   Observations of
              anisotropy potentially provide useful constraints on dynamic processes, but
              fundamental mineral physics issues, such as whether LPO or SPO controls the
              anisotropy have not been resolved. This project plans to identify the likely
              physical mechanisms of seismic anisotropy by combining mineral-physics-based
              geodynamical modeling with seismological observations. This will allow
              identification of the horizontal and vertical flow geometry in the D" layer,
              the degree of chemical heterogeneity, and possibly constraints on the
              distribution and shape of partially molten materials.
