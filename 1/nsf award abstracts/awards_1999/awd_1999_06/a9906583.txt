Abstract    :
              Dr. Kim Dunbar is being supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
              Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to elucidate
              structure/magnetochemical relationships in several families of magnetic
              clusters and materials. Specifically, the work proposed (i) will expand recent
              findings in Dr. Dunbar's laboratory that binary transition metal compounds of
              the TCNQ anion radical with Fe, Co, Mn and Ni exhibit a ferromagnetic-like
              behavior best described as a spin glass; (ii) will explore polypyridine-type
              ligands in open-shell metal systems of varied geometries in which metals will
              be able to communicate with each other; and (iii) will examine molecular
              assemblies in which octahedral metal ions are used to synthesize paramagnetic
              squares and cubes with cyano or metal-dicyano linkages.		

The knowledge base
              derived from the projects will have a significant impact in physics and in
              materials research; in addition, it will provide an understanding of
              molecule-based magnetic materials. Novel molecular materials will be discovered
              that will have fundamental technological relevance in such applications as
              magnetic storage devices, electrically or magnetically bistable devices and
              miniaturization of magnetics to the nanoscale level. Graduate and undergraduate
              students, and post-doctoral associates will be trained in an area that has
              exceptional importance and that will open up venues for either industrial or
              academic employment.
