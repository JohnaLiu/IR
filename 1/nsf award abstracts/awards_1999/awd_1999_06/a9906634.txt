              ABSTRACT

OCE-9906634


There is mounting ecological evidence that the
              oceanic ecosystem of the central North Pacific Ocean my be undergoing a shift
              from a system in which nitrogen limits primary production to one limited by the
              availability of phosphorous.  Before we can evaluate this possibility and its
              oceanographic and ecological significance, we must first understand the
              biogeochemical mechanisms working in the cycling of phosphorous in the oceanic
              water column.   To that end, the principal investigator on this project will
              conduct a study of phosphorous cycling and particulate organic carbon (POC)
              export in the North Pacific gyre using the naturally-occurring, short-lived
              radionuclides Phosphorous-32, Phosphorous-33, Thorium-234, and Beryllium-7. 
              The P isotope measurements would permit the estimation of P residence times in
              the dissolved and particulate pools.  The work would be carried out in
              conjunction with an already established monthly U.S.JGOFS-HOT (Hawaiian Ocean
              Time Series) cruise program.
