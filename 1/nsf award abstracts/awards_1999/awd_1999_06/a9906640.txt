Abstract    :
              This doctoral dissertation research project will explore social structural
              influences on the supply of labor to occupations. Current research in the field
              of labor economics pays little explicit attention to the effect of social
              networks on the supply of labor to occupations. Building upon the first PI's
              prior work on the ecological theory of competition of social groups for
              members, the present theory argues that groups inhabit bounded regions of a
              sociodemographic phase space, and that competition is created by multiple
              groups overlapping in this space. A group's position in sociodemographic space
              is determined by the aggregate sociodemographic characteristics of its members.
              The project will explore the implications of this theory with respect to the
              supply of labor to occupations. It will model a system of occupations in the
              U.S., using data taken from the Current Population Survey Annual Demographic
              Files (1988-1998).
