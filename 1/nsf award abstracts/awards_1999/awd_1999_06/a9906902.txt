Abstract    :
              This project will combine all available broadband teleseismic daa from Iceland
              and Hawaii to obtain hign-resolution mantle discontinuity structures beneath
              the two oceanic hotspots.  The primary questions that wil be addressed are what
              is the nature of the 220- and 330-km discontinuities, and what is the magnitude
              and sharpness of the disconituities?
