Abstract    :
              This three-year study will investigate the impact that anthropogenic disturbance
              has on tundra land cover near Barrow Alaska.  Based on photographs made over
              the last 50 years, anthropogenic disturbances will be documented and the
              evolving response by plant communities will be chronicled.  Additional tests
              concerning the resilience and resistance of principal tundra plant communities
              will be examined using manipulation experiments within experimental plots. The
              data developed from this study will be made available in a Geographic
              Information System format.  The concepts and parameters obtained will then be
              used in a geographically based Arctic System Land Transformation Model in order
              to examine the possible impacts of man's expanding use of the Alaskan tundra. 
              Undergraduate students from the Barrow community will be utilized as research
              assistants.  This project will directly link with ongoing studies of the
              climatological and vegetation transformations occurring in the Arctic
              tundra.
