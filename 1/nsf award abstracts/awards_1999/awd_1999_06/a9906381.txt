Abstract    :
              The main theoretical objective of the project is to develop a representation
              that combines the expressive power of logic with the robustness of
              probabilistic techniques, including the ability to learn and adapt from
              experience.   To this end, the PIs intend to integrate inductive logic
              programming with Bayesian networks.   Empirical validation of the approach
              within the context of a domain with potential high social impact will focus on
              gesture recognition by mobile robots, in order to build upon the expertise of
              the bilateral partners.   The results of this research will significantly
              advance the state of the art in human-robot interface design.
