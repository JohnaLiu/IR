Abstract    :
              With previous funding the PIs carried out a marine geophysical survey of the
              areas of new pyroclastic flow deltas along the coast of the Montserrat Island
              in the Lesser Antilles after a recent volcanic activity. Funds are provided for
              another year of study of the material and data collected during that survey.
              The objectives of the study are: to gain insight into the behavior of hot
              pyroclastic flows as they are discharged into the ocean, evaluate depositional
              processes, and determine the volume of material deposited in the marine
              environment as part of the total magmatic budget for the Montserrat volcanic
              activity.
