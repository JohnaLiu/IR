Abstract    :
              

The proposal is a two-year industrial-university collaborative research
              effort between Duke University and Cree Research Inc., both located in Durham,
              NC, for research on the group III-Nitride blue semiconductor lasers. It is
              specifically for the Postdoctoral Industrial Fellowship Award in the Grant
              Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) program.  The proposed
              work is to systematically investigate through theory and measurements the basic
              parameters of bandgap offset, carrier transport, waveguide losses, index of
              refraction, etc.  Such studies if successful will undoubtedly contribute to the
              basic understanding of the material system and device operation. Such
              information will be very useful for a large segment of industries for the
              commercialization of the blue lasers.
