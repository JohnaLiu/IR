Abstract    :
              Through a quantitative, historical investigation of the gay and lesbian movement
              and its influence on the decriminalization of sodomy, this doctoral
              dissertation research project examines the conditions under which a social
              movement can successfully influence public policy or law. Social movements
              customarily develop in order to change society in some way, yet there is little
              research on the ability or inability of social movements to generate political
              change. Drawing from resource mobilization and political process models of
              social movements and sociological theories of the state, this project will test
              a theory of movement policy success involving three broad factors: the
              political context surrounding the movement, movement strength and activism, and
              cultural opposition to the movement. The U.S. gay and lesbian movement began in
              1969 with the Stonewall Rebellion. An important goal of the movement is the
              removal of state-level sodomy laws. Sodomy laws criminalize specific sexual
              acts, usually oral and anal sex, between consenting adults and are often used
              as the justification for denying other rights to homosexuals. Event history
              analysis will be used to examine, over time and across states, the important of
              the political context, movement characteristics, and opposition on the
              decriminalization of these laws, from 1969 to 1997.
