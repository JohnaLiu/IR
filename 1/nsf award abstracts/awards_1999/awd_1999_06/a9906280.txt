Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator will continue an ongoing, long-term, collaborative
              study of the significance of altitudinally separable differentially weathered
              bedrock surfaces that occur along the eastern coastal highland periphery of the
              Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS).  This project will focus on 1) determining the
              exposure and burial histories of bedrock surfaces, using terrestrial cosmogenic
              nuclides and geomorphic data; and 2) incorporating these data with geological
              evidence for ice cover and ice flow into new models for the geometry of the
              Quebec-Labradoran sector of the LIS.  Emphasis will be placed on the most
              weathered terrains in regions that have focussed throughout the twentieth
              century in the 'nunatak controversy'.
This project has three principal
              components: 1) obtaining chronological constraints by making measurements of
              10Be and 26A1 in rock exposed to cosmic radiation; 2) interpreting
              chronological evidence in terms of the geological and geomorphological field
              evidence to address three century-old controversial questions; 3) developing a
              new ground-truthed geometry using a combination of forward and inverse ice
              sheet models that are sensitive to surface geological boundary conditions and
              vertical and lateral limits as pinned along the eastern margin.
Results of
              this research will have direct implications on present and future studies of
              mantle rheology, will provide a mechanism to test the validity of existing and
              widely-used LIS ice sheet models, and will improve our interpretation of marine
              isotopic records.  A ground-truthed model of the eastern LIS and will help our
              understanding of the LIS on sub-Milankovitch climate and iceberg rafting events
              in the north Atlantic.
