Abstract    :
              This project is centered on experiments using a cloud chamber with an
              electrodynamic balance that permits the observation of individual, levitated
              ice crystals for long periods of time as they grow or evaporate in controlled
              conditions of temperature, pressure, and humidity.  The pressure and
              temperature can be set low enough to simulate the conditions in cirrus clouds
              in the atmosphere.  Three sets of experiments will be performed: (1)
              measurement of the growth, evaporation, and light-scattering properties of ice
              crystals typical of cirrus clouds; (2) study of the freezing of liquid droplets
              and the rapid evolution from spherical to crystal shape; (3) measuring the
              transfer of mass and electrical charge between pairs of crystals as they
              collide.  This work will contribute to fundamental questions such as crystal
              habit and its dependence on environmental conditions, to current concerns about
              climatic effects of cirrus clouds, and to a better understanding of the growth
              and evaporation of ice crystals under different environmental conditions.
