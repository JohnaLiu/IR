Abstract    :
              Previous research shows that memories are not distributed evenly over the life
              course, but cluster during the critical period of adolescence and early
              adulthood. Events that occur either earlier or later are less likely to be
              remembered. There is little consensus about the causes of the clustering, but a
              social psychological explanation suggests that the critical period for memory
              may be associated with change in the self-concept. Such change may be
              age-related, but it may also be precipitated by transformative events unrelated
              to age. This doctoral dissertation research focuses on emigration between
              1970-1997 from the USSR/former USSR to the US as an example of a transformative
              life event. Particularly for "third wave" emigres who departed in the
              1970's-1980's and believed that they could never return, emigration represented
              a complete and irrevocable break with their former lives. The central
              hypothesis of this study is that the period of emigration will constitute a
              critical period for memory, regardless of the age at which an individual
              emigrated. Further, the dramatic transition experienced by third-wave emigres
              is expected to produce a critical period for memory that is more pronounced
              than that of later emigres. Data on emigres' memories of public and personal
              events will be gathered via interviews and self-administered questionnaires.
