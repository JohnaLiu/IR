Abstract    :
              Investigators are documenting specific biochemical and molecular pathways
              responsible for photodamage and photoprotection in symbiotic dinoflagellates
              experiencing thermal stress under both natural (in situ) conditions and in
              laboratory manipulations.  Then, they can establish how damage and/or
              protective processes may be accurately assessed by non-destructive chlorophyll
              fluorescence techniques.  Since mechanisms of photoprotection and photodamage
              act simultaneously, they are studied together to fully understand dynamics of
              thermal bleaching.  Monitoring the physiology of symbiotic dinoflagellates in
              controlled culture conditions and within corals in situ (against a variety of
              scales, from molecular to organismal), investigators can identify cellular
              mechanisms involved in daily as well as seasonal fluctuations of
              photosynthesis, photoinhibition, and photoprotection.  These mechanisms, in
              particular, appear to play a major role in determining ecological distribution,
              as well as the ultimate fate of algal-invertebrate symbioses during
              environmentally relevant stress.
