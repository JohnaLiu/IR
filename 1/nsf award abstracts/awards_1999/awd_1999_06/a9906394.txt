Abstract    :
                The SMART GRE Prep Course was developed through HRD-9631519, a Model Project
              for Women and Girls (MPWG).  
  The course improved GRE practice scores
              significantly.  
  A number of faculty contacted the PI regarding testing the
              prep course at their campuses.
  The planning grant would facilitate
              communication between faculty who wish to test the SMART GRE Prep Course at
              women's colleges.  The partner institutions include Baylor College of Medicine,
              Mount St. Mary's University, Mount Holyoke, Spelman College, Texas Women's
              University, Wesleyan College and possibly Wellesley College.  This grant would
              improve planning a collaborative effort by funding:  (1) continued assessment
              of a GRE Prep Course, (2) visits to campuses to facilitate planning GRE Prep
              Courses and institutional partnerships and (3) a mini-conference to finalize
              preparation of a Large Collaborative Project.
