Abstract    :
              The recent explosion of global computer networks, and the ensuing pressure to
              rapidly establish the legal, technological, and regulatory basis for global
              electronic commerce, is bringing about the redefinition of time-tested legal
              and social instruments of exchange, such as signatures and money. This project
              documents the construction of the European electronic security infrastructure
              by an interdisciplinary collaboration of cryptologists, lawyers, and
              regulators.  The methodology to be employed is ethnography informed by the
              concerns of critical theory.  The research involves interviews with
              cryptologists, lawyers, and regulators who are currently working in this area.
              Areas of concern to be explored include: authentication technologies, awareness
              of litigation and legislative initiatives, and experience of using
              authentication technologies.  The investigator, in addition to gathering and
              analyzing interview data, will also examine scientific papers, conference
              proceedings, manuals, patents, and other written indicia of contemporary expert
              thinking about security concerns.  The objective of this research is to broaden
              public discourse over electronic security from its current narrow focus on
              privacy and to improve how cryptology is conceived and engaged.
