Abstract    :
              Investigators at Guilford College, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
              Astrophysics (CfA), and the United States Naval Observatory jointly propose to
              analyze about two decades of (existing) very long baseline interferomentry
              (VLBI data to increase, by an order of magnitude, the accuracy of measurements
              of the parameter y which characterizes the contribution of space curvature to
              gravitational deflection.

A significant part of this proposal involves the
              role of undergraduate students.  During the summer, a Guilford College
              undergraduate will accompany the P.I. to a major research facility (the CfA)
              and will participate in ongoing scientific research.  As evidenced by the large
              number of student-initiated research projects published each year by the
              National Council on Undergraduate Research, physics students from Guilford
              College have been quite successful doing and presenting their research work.
