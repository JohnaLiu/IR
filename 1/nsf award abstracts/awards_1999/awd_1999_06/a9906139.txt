This eighteen month award supports an US- EU workshop on
              learning from science and technology policy evaluation between Philip Shapira
              of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Stefan Kuhlmann at the Fraunhofer
              Institute for Systems and Innovation Research in Karlsruhe, Germany.  The
              objective of the workshop is to examine what can be learned from recent science
              and technology policy evaluation approaches and to consider implications for
              future evaluation strategies and framework policies.  The workshop will
              approach this problem through benchmarking the state of the art and exploring
              ideas, opportunities, projects, and needs for future work.

The US
              investigator brings to this workshop expertise in changes in US science and
              technology policy evaluation.  This is complemented by EU expertise and
              interest in collaborating internationally after a period of intensive internal
              building of European-level science and technology policy projects and
              evaluation networks.  The goal of the workshop is to initiate a multi-year
              US-European network that would aim to share best practices and review methods,
              examine policy implications of evaluation, and stimulate new collaborative
              research projects.
