DLI-International: Imesh Toolkit

This is the first
              year funding of a three-year continuing award.  Recent years have seen the
              emergence of the subject gateway approach to Internet resource discovery and
              leading gateway initiatives have recently been collaborating informally under
              the name IMesh.  The IMesh Toolkit project, a partnership of the UK Office for
              Library and Information Networking at the University of Bath, the Institute for
              Learning and Research Technology at the University of Bristol and the Internet
              Scout Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, aims to advance the
              system framework within which subject gateways and related services operate by
              defining an architecture which specifies individual components and how they
              communicate.
