Abstract    :
              This grant will allow the Principal Investigator to complete research and
              writing on a history of the nature-nurture debate as it unfolded in Russia,
              from pre-revolutionary times to the present day.

The work will chronicle the
              creation of eugenics in the 1 920s by several groups of experimental
              biologists, psychiatrists, anthropologists, and physicians; analyze the
              research they conducted as part of the Russian Eugenics Society; chronicle the
              "demise" of eugenics in 1930 and its rapid transformation and rebirth as
              "medical genetics" in 1934; show how personal and professional networks were
              able to maintain the field's traditions "underground" during decades of
              Stalinism and Lysenkoism; and demonstrate the way these networks and
              institutions reemerged in the 1960s and 1970s to help shape the "new" Soviet
              biology of the Brezhnev era.

Based on some twenty years of research,
              archival work, and interviews, as well as preliminary publications focusing on
              particular people, topics, and periods, the work will also include much
              information that has only recently become available, including data collected
              by the Eugenics Bureau on the Petersburg intelligentsia; archival documentation
              of Ivanov's attempt to hybridize humans and chimpanzees using artificial
              insemination, information on H.J. Muller's activities in Russia; recorded
              interviews with principals; and primary and secondary materials on the abiding
              connections between eugenics and Soviet psychology and psychiatry.

By
              carefully tracking the field of human heredity, the institutions where it was
              studied, and the professional and personal networks that created and sustained
              them, I hope this work will help to revise and broaden our understanding of
              eugenics by providing a new national case study, illuminate the complex role of
              networks in sustaining Russian science under totalitarianism, and focus the
              attention of historians of science, technology, and medicine on the role of
              networks in the events they study, as well as affording a new and somewhat less
              culture-bound perspective on current bioethical issues and concerns. Given the
              topic and the rather startling character of much I will discuss, the work
              should be of interest not only to scientists, science historians, Russian
              historians, physicians, and bioethicists, but also to the broader public.
