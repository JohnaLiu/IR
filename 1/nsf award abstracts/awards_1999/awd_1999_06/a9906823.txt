ABSTRACT

OCE-9906823
					       

This work will constrain the
              234Th/POC ratio of marine particulate matter which has been used extensively to
              evaluate the export flux of carbon from the surface ocean. The objectives of
              the proposal are to collect various size fractions of organic matter from the
              Gulf of Mexico and to quantify the relationship between polysaccharide enriched
              marine aggregates and Th(IV) deficiency, to conduct laboratory experiments to
              investigate the interactions of Th(IV) with individual classes of organic
              compounds, and to construct an improved scavenging model of Th(IV) based on the
              nature of the organic material. Experimental and model results would be used to
              enhance the use of the 234Th/POC ratio for the determination of particulate
              organic carbon flux from the surface ocean.
