Abstract    :
              This award of $ 20 K is for travel support for students attending the Sixth
              International Conference on Southern Hemisphere Meteorology and Oceanography to
              be held in Santiago, Chile April 3-7, 2000.  This is the sixth workshop in a
              series aimed at promoting understanding of atmospheric and oceanic processes
              special to the SH and their linkages to the Tropics and the Northern
              Hemisphere. An international conference of this kind fosters scientific
              discourse as well as data exchange between scientists. The theme of this
              particular conference, Water Resources Management: Focus on the Southern
              Hemisphere is likely to facilitate a dialogue between the scientific community
              and the users of weather and climate products. The travel grants will be a good
              opportunity for young scientists to become aware of the research being done
              overseas.
