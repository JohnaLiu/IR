Abstract    :
              The Computer Graphics and Visualization Education Workshop brings together
              computer graphics educators to consider the future of computer graphics
              education.   The recommendations will influence many ongoing efforts in
              curriculum development, including the ACM/IEEE computer science curriculum 2001
              effort.   The focus of the workshop is twofold:  1)  teaching computer graphics
              and visualization and 2) using computer graphics and visualization for
              education in general.

The outcomes of the workshop will be 1) a set of
              recommendations for future computer graphics education; 2) an ongoing
              collaboration in this area between US and European educators, with particular
              emphasis on Portugal; 3) evaluation of existing collaborative teaching tools
              and shared immersive environments and recommendations for future development,
              and 4) reports from the workshop available for international dissemination on a
              website.
