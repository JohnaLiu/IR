Abstract    :
              This Project is the third biennial, international Gordon Conference on
              thermodynamics.  It will be held 18-23 April, 1999, at Il Ciocco in Tuscany,
              Italy.  The Conference sites oscillate between the U.S.A. and Europe, in large
              part because of the many scientists and engineers working
in this area in
              Europe.  "Thermodynamics" is interpreted very broadly for the purposes of these
              meetings.  The session topics will be:
1. Energy analysis today and
              tomorrow;
2. Engineering design;
3. Thermodynamics of complexity;
4.
              Thermodynamics of computation;
5. Thermodynamics of phase change and phase
              equilibrium in small systems;
6. Thermodynamic optimization in naturally
              organized systems;
7. Quantum statistical mechanics and surface kinetics;
8.
              Thermodynamics in economics.
As of 2 April, 1999, 128 people had registered.
              Realistically, we do not expect this number because several have applied from
              Russia and will probably have insufficient funds to attend.  However the
              expected set of
participants will include at least one Nobelist, many young
              scientists and representatives from at least 21 nations.  The format will be
              that of traditional Gordon Conferences, with formal presentations in mornings
              and evenings, including time for considerable discussion, and informal
              discussion during the afternoons.  Also in keeping with Gordon Conference
              regulations, there will be no formal conference proceedings or citations
              without explicit author's permission of work presented at the Conference.
