A project to conduct Inuit oral history
              research uses historical photographs from the south coast of Baffin Island to
              explore Inuit knowledge and perceptions of the environment, climate change, and
              culture change in the twentieth century.  The photographs come from the
              collections of Robert Flaherty, Donald MacMillan, and Peter Pitseolak and cover
              the periods 1913-14, 1921-22, and 1940-60, respectively.  The research will be
              undertaken in and around the present-day Nunavut communities of Cape Dorset and
              Lake Harbor.  Environmental knowledge documented through the interviews will be
              linked with broader, regional scale environmental data available from a variety
              of instrumental, archival, and highly resolved proxy records (e.g., ice cores,
              tree rings, sediments) to provide new and unique insights into local aspects of
              the human dimensions of climate change.  The combined data set, augmented by
              summary maps generated with geographic information systems (GIS), will not only
              help to integrate data representing different spatial scales, but will also
              join indigenous environmental knowledge and Western scientific studies.
