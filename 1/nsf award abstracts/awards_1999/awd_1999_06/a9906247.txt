Quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) are of great
              scientific as well as technological importance. The QWIPs performance can be
              drastically improved, if the lateral dimension of a one-dimensional (ID)
              quantum wire is reduced to a OD quantum dot. The goal of the proposed research
              is to develop patterned quantum dot (PQD) structures, to explore the
              fundamental physics in PQDs, to develop nanopatterning technology for PQDs
              (such as nanoimprint and MBE), and to investigate the infrared detection of
              PQDs. The proposed research is based on a unique combination of three experts
              in quantum well physics (Prof. Tsui), infrared photodetectors (Dr. Choi), and
              nanofabrication (Prof. Chou).~ The outcome of the research will have
              significant impact to patterned quantum dots, quantum well infrared
              photodetectors, quantum well physics and applications, and nanoimprint
              lithography applications.
