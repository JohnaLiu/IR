This award supports collaborative research on geometric
              probability between U.S. mathematicians Eric Grinberg, Temple University,
              Gaoyang Zhang, Brooklyn Polytechnic University, and Chinese mathematicians Ren
              Delin, Wuhan Yejin University of Science and Technology, and Li Haizhong,
              Tsinghua University.  The proposed research deals with the basic theory of
              geometric probability, and will focus on various integral formulas.  The
              problems proposed fall into three categories:  kinematic formulas of convex
              bodies; inclusion measures of convex bodies; and integral formulas on
              manifolds. Applications of this work are anticipated in other fields of
              mathematics, as well as in areas such as X-ray imaging and other imaging
              technologies.  The US team has a senior and a junior partner with strong
              qualifications in this area of research; their Chinese counterparts are also
              highly qualified.

This project involves participation of junior faculty and
              graduate students and is based on an interesting topic which will profit from
              the contributions of both groups. The senior Chinese PI is a recognized expert
              in the area of geometric probability. The junior Chinese PI is at arguably
              China's top university and is receiving support from the Chinese NSF for this
              research and for the international cooperation.
