The First Midwest Conference for New Directions
              in Experimental Design is
planned for May 18-29, 2000, at the Ohio State
              University.  The meeting will
focus on the active areas of research in
              experimental design that have
relevance to industry, especially engineering
              and manufacturing.  Areas of
emphasis are design for nonlinear models,
              experimentation for factor
screening, design for multiple linear responses,
              experimentation in the
presence of trends, computer experiments, and various
              other approaches
including Bayesian methods.  In addition to the invited
              talks, ample time
will be given for small group discussions in which new
              researchers will
meet with key speakers, mentors and other participants.  A
              panel discussion is
planned for the final day of the conference to discuss the
              future of
experimental design.  

Although the geographic area for inclusion
              of participants is restricted,
the industrial use of experimentation in the
              face of time dependent,
infrequent observations makes the topic of current
              major concern.  This venue
will help focus part of the statistics community on
              these problems.
