The tiger swallowtail butterfly species Papilio glaucus and
              P. canadensis
meet in a narrow zone of hybridization across the eastern US. 
              They differ
in ecologically important traits, including the control of winter
              diapause
and the mimicry (only by P. glaucus females) of a related,
              distasteful
species.  These traits are controlled by genes on the X- and
              Y-chromosomes.
Theoretical advances in the biology of hybrid zones, such as
              this one,
have allowed the measurement of the strength of natural selection
              acting on
ecologically important traits, as well as the rate that other genes
              can
slip through to the opposite species.  The authors will use this theory
              to
measure the strength of natural selection acting on diapause,
              wing
coloration and other X- and Y-associated traits.  They will do
              parallel
field experiments to measure selection on these traits.  Finally,
              they will
measure the ability of this selection to block the spread of other
              genes
between these hybridizing species.

Sex chromosomes play a central
              role in biology and have several properties
unique from other chromosomes, but
              biologists have few data from nature
about how evolutionary forces affect
              sex-chromosome variation.  The authors
of this study exploit key features of
              the biology of these butterflies to
study the evolutionary pressures acting on
              sex chromosomes and the spread
of genes between related species.
