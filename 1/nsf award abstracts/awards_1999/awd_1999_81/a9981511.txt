Abstract    :
              The physical mechanisms by which ice crystals in the atmosphere grow by vapor
              deposition and shrink by evaporation are complicated and still uncertain.  Yet
              the exchange of vapor between a crystal and its environment is central for
              ice-phase evolution.  Vapor deposition establishes the initial shapes, masses,
              and fallspeeds of the particles and hence the time needed for interactions with
              other cloud particles to become important and for precipitation to form.  
              Evaporation of ice crystals determines the lifetime of cirrus clouds in their
              decaying stage.  This project is an experimental study of the growth and
              evaporation of individual ice crystals in controlled, laboratory conditions,
              over a range of temperature, pressure, and humidity appropriate for conditions
              in the free atmosphere.  The experiments employ the method of electrodynamic
              balance for levitating individual particles in a controlled environment.  In
              addition, there is provision for moving the air through the chamber to study
              the effects of ventilation on crystal growth.  The research will shed new light
              on vapor exchange at a crystal interface and provide the information needed to
              improve the parameterization of crystal growth in numerical models of cloud
              development and the transport of chemical species in cloudy atmospheres.
