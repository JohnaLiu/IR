Arastoopour
This award supports Hamid Arastoopour, three graduate
              students, and a post-doctoral student from the Illinois Institute of Technology
              in a collaboration with Matthias Bohnet of the Department of Chemical
              Engineering at the Technical University in Braunschweig, Germany.  The project
              will focus on using the Eulerian and Lagrangian numerical methods to simulate
              particulate flow in various complex geometries.  The combined U.S.-German team
              will be able to gain a better fundamental understanding of particle flow
              patterns and interactions in gas and solid flow systems that are of interest to
              such diverse industries as petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and material
              processing.  Specifically, they will concentrate on the redesign of efficient
              diffusers, ejectors and blowers.  The groups have complementary capabilities
              for experimental verification of the models, and the collaboration will lead to
              significant advances in the field.  There is also a strong emphasis on training
              of junior researchers.
