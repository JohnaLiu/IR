Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to address and, with the generated understanding,
              to contribute to improved materials processing capabilities for those
              conditions where the inhomogeneities of the polymer melt case significant
              couplings between diffusion and elastic stresses.  The PI's attack on this
              complex problem involves three independent experiments to permit the enhanced
              understanding to be created.  It is expected that significant improvements in
              the processing of polymeric materials will be derived from this investigation. 
              It is also expected that the students, who participate in the PI's educational
              program, will develop significant skills in utilizing and understanding these
              important materials.
