This award supports Andre Sharon, Thomas Bifano, two
              post-doctoral students, and six graduate students from Boston University in a
              collaboration with Fritz Klocke of the Fraunhofer Institute for Production
              Technology in Aachen, Germany.  The collaboration will develop the
              manufacturing science for a new class of highly three-dimensional, precisely
              machined, and automatically assembled microsystems.  The manufacturing approach
              will address the multi-scale (nanometer to millimeter) interface problem
              associated with micromachined devices, providing the means for production of a
              broad range of commercially important assembled microsystems.  The project team
              offers unique qualifications for the multidisciplinary work to be done.  The
              project requires closely coupled efforts in precision engineering, materials
              processing, microfabrication, metrology, deposition and coating, and surface
              micromachining.
