Abstract    :
              Engineering - Chemical (53)
This project adapts the McMaster University Program
              in problem-based learning (PBL) combined with progress being made in
              interactive computer-aided instruction at the University of Michigan (which
              utilizes virtual reality).  This implementation is aimed at improving the
              ability of Lamar University Beaumont's Chemical Engineering Department to give
              its students a better understanding of the basics of chemical engineering and
              at the same time develop their skills in using computer packages properly.  The
              primary objective of the project is to use computer-aided modeling and
              simulation packages with proven learning principles and realistic problem
              practices to provide accelerated exposure to problem-based learning.  The
              project impacts nine courses in the chemical engineering curriculum through the
              use of "hands-on" modeling and simulation of chemical molecules, processes, and
              processing equipment. The ABET Engineering Criteria 2000 framework is used to
              evaluate the project's student learning outcomes.   This project also
              contributes to the university's efforts to reach high school teachers and
              students through science and engineering demonstrations incorporating PBL.
