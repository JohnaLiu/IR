Abstract    :
              This award will continue the work of the Network Startup Resource Center (NSRC)
              for three years.  The NSRC functions as a virtual global clearinghouse and
              service center for facilitating the establishment of computer networks in
              less-networked countries and for enhancing network operations globally.  This
              activity 
enables communication between the U.S. Research and Education
              community and like communities abroad.  Past NSRC assistance has ranged from
              technical information that is archived on Internet servers (e-mail responder,
              World Wide Web) to on-site consulting, teaching at workshops, and on-the-job
              training in the U.S.  By providing technical assistance to numerous countries
              around the world, and by tracking international connectivity developments, the
              NSRC has established and maintains an extensive base of contacts willing to
              contribute their time and expertise to further these efforts.  Under the
              previous NSF awards, the NSRC contributed significantly to the creation of
              national or regional networks in Africa, Central America and the Caribbean,
              Central and Eastern Europe and several former Soviet states, and in South,
              Southeast, East, and 
Central Asia as well as to some start-up K-12 network
              systems in the US.  Visit the NSRC at URL:http://www.nsrc.org.
