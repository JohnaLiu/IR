              Abstract - Han - 9981972

Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) consists of hard
              segments composed of diisocynate and short-chain diols (as chain extender)
              which form a crystalline phase at service temperatures, and soft segments
              composed of long-chain diols which control low temperature properties.  The
              most undesirable feature of the many TPUs currently available commercially is
              thermal instability at processing temperatures, approximately 190-220oC, i.e.,
              they undergo thermal degradation and/or crosslink reactions.  This is primarily
              due to the thermal instability of aromatic diisocyanates often used in
              commercial TPUs.  The PI plans to investigate structure-morphology-rheology
              relationships in thermally stable TPUs having side-chain liquid
              crystals.

The rheological behavior of TPUs is intimately related to the
              morphological state of the polymer.  A better understanding of
              structure-morphology-rheology relationships in TPU with or without side-chain
              liquid crystals, can be used to determine consistent and optimum processing
              conditions.  The PI plans to investigate how hydrogen bonding might affect the
              morphology and thus the rheology of TPU with and without side-chain liquid
              crystals using in situ infrared spectroscopy at elevated temperatures
              (170-250oC).  Oscillatory, transient, and steady-state shear flow behaviors of
              the TPUs synthesized with and without side-chain liquid crystals will be
              investigated.  The research, when completed, may lead to the possibility of
              creating special supramolecular structures by means of small changes in the
              architecture of the macromolecules.
