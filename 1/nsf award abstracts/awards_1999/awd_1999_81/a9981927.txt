Abstract    :
              This proposal is aimed at enhancing the tcptrace program that was designed  as a
              tool to explore the details of individual TCP connections and to present the
              information numerically and graphically.  This tool is being 
widely used
              within the Internet engineering community.  The enhancements under this project
              include: 1) revised documentation, 2) port to Microsoft NT platform and 3)
              additional features such as IPv6 support, NLANR trace file formats support, 
              and support for newer link layer protocols like ATM.
