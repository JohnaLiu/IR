The Guayana
              Shield in northern South America is a geologically ancient area whose soils are
              heavily weathered and very nutrient-poor.  Scattered throughout the region are
              over 50 isolated table mountains called tepuis.  They harbor some of the most
              unique and localized species of plants on earth.  This study focuses on two of
              the largest groups of plants endemic to this region, the Rapateacea, with some
              100 species, and the pitcairnioid Bromeliaceae, comprising some 150 species. 
              Most highland members of these groups are restricted to a single mountaintop,
              thus providing a unique opportunity to study their evolutionary and
              biogeographical history, similar to oceanic islands.  The project will use
              modern molecular techniques to study variation in the DNA sequences of these
              groups to determine their relationships and understand how they evolved on
              different mountaintops.  This study will help generate models of how these
              groups and numerous other smaller groups of organisms that share restricted
              ranges on the Guayana Shield evolved over time in their tepui habitats.
