Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)  This Proof of Concept (POC) project is developing and
              pilot testing several learning modules in the area of cognitive science for use
              in courses in several different disciplines, including mathematics, computer
              science, and philosophy. In particular the multi-week modules are organized
              around the general theme of "perception". Pilot testing is underway at the PI's
              institution and several partner institutions. An external evaluation plan is in
              place and several leading cognitive scientists are engaged as consultants to
              the project. In addition, a partnership with an important publisher of
              cognitive science literature is being pursued as part of a strategy to move to
              a full educational materials development project supporting "cognitive sciences
              across the curriculum".
