Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is preparation of a series of polycyclic
              alkyne-bridged organometallic compounds.  The target molecules represent
              hybrids of organometallic fullerenyne segments and the organic graphydiyne.
              They are of high interest as electro-active and extremely porous organometallic
              materials.  The pyrolysis pyrolysis of large, alkyne-bridged cobalt- or
              iron-containing, highly unsaturated organometallics should lead to the
              formation of novel metal-carbon solids.  The high-temperature pyrolysis of the
              proposed carbon-rich organometallics could lead to the formation of nanotubes,
              circumventing the use of gas phase conditions. The educational portion of the
              project will include curriculum development with a strong emphasis on the use
              of the Web.

With this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. Uwe H.
              Bunz of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of South
              Carolina.  Professor Bunz will  focus his research on the preparation of
              organometallic compounds with the goal of constructing fullerenyne-segments and
              new metal-containing materials.  Pyrolysis of the materials could serve as a
              method for the preparation of nanotubes.  Carbon-rich compounds of the types
              proposed are of great interest as a new generation of    advanced materials for
              future applications in electronic and photonic devices.   The educational
              portion of the project will stress use of the Web in course development.
