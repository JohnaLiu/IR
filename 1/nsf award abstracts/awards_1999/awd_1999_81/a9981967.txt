Abstract    :
              This project is designed to develop and test phylogenetically based statistical
              methods that can properly be applied to comparative data.  The PIs will
              investigate the use of generalized least-squares methods, independent
              contrasts, and other statistical treatments using Monte Carlo simulations;
              develop statistics to assess phylogenetic effects of a given trait, and
              investigate means for placing confidence and prediction intervals on
              phylogenetic hypotheses.  The results will be converted into a freely available
              software package distributed electronically.
