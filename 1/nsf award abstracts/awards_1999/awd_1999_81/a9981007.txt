Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

One of the beautiful and applicable parts of
              mathematics is the study of symmetry, that is, the actions, or representations,
              of groups of symmetry transformations on physical objects.  For example, the
              square has eight symmetry transformations.  These symmetries simplify the
              analysis of many physical systems based on a square shape (e.g., the analysis
              of vibrations of a square mechanical system or the spectrum of a square
              molecule.  The same holds true for other shapes, making the theory of group
              representations a powerful tool for mathematicians and scientists.  The theory
              however is somewhat technical; so, group theory is usually taught and described
              in courses at the graduate level. 

The proof-of-concept project is
              developing an undergraduate, upper division course and accompanying textbook to
              teach the theory of the representations of finite groups, with specific and
              detailed applications, to mathematics majors, mathematics education majors, and
              to students majoring in science and engineering.  This work is making available
              to a larger audience the study of a beautiful and powerful branch of
              mathematics and to teach its applications to a larger group of scientists and
              engineers.
