Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)

This project develops a prototype for an adaptive
              learning architecture with Web delivery and management technology. It also
              develops and delivers the course content for two cornerstone courses in a
              recently initiated technology education program. The technology education
              program is targeted to students transferring from two year institutions. This
              project focuses on providing the technology, methodology and course content for
              two courses that cover the theoretical background and practical programming
              background for students entering the technology education program. The
              architecture features the use of a database of related material, which differs
              in difficulty, assumed background and delivery modes. It also features the use
              of a knowledge base in which the instructional material is organized as a
              dependency graph between the instructional topics, management of student
              progress through the material, and navigational tools which allow students to
              bridge gaps in their background and explore topics that catch their interest.
              The adaptive learning architecture supports students with diverse backgrounds
              and has the potential to address problems common to many institutions of higher
              learning.
