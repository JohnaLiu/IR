This award supports Lon Wilkens and a graduate student from
              the University of Missouri-St. Louis in a collaboration with Leo van Hemmem of
              the Department of Physics at the Technical University of Munich, Germany.  The
              collaboration seeks to understand the neural mechanisms which underlie passive
              electrosensory detection and capture of planktonic prey by paddlefish.  That
              fish has a unique, elongated rostrum which has recently been shown to act as an
              antenna in plankton feeding.  The paddlefish is an ideal subject for studying
              the neural mechanisms which map the sensory environment since the paddlefish
              sensitivity to electric fields is acute and provides sensory information
              necessary for accurate feeding strikes by juvenile fish in the absence of other
              sensory inputs.  Neuroanatomical and electophysiological experiments will
              provide parameters for modeling the peripheral electroreceptive system and for
              characterizing peripheral sensitivity to natural planktonic prey.  The
              collaboration will combine the theoretical modeling expertise of the German
              group with the experimental capabilities of the U.S. side.
