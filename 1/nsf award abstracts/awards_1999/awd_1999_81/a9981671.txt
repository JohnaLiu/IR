Animal species fit along a continuum from generalists, which
              utilize a broad array of foods and habitats, to specialists, which have very
              specific requirements. Some plant-feeding insects can successfully consume
              leaves from hundreds of diverse plant species, but most of these insects
              specialize on one to a few plant species. In contrast, the majority of
              devastating crop pests are generalists. One of these, Heliothis virescens, is a
              major cotton pest but also feeds on tomatoes, soybean, tobacco and other
              non-agricultural plants. Heliothis subflexa is closely related to H. virescens
              but is an extreme specialists, only feeding on some species of Physalis
              (Chinese lantern plant). These two insect species can be hybridized and the
              offspring backcrossed to the specialist. The genetically segregating backcross
              offspring vary in degree of specialization. A molecular gene mapping technique,
              Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism, will be used to determine which genes
              in these hybrid offspring enable them to consume the generalist species food
              plants. Information gained from this genetic mapping research will be used to
              examine how genes interact in determining the ecological niche of a species,
              and could provide tools for decreasing the genetic potency of pests.
