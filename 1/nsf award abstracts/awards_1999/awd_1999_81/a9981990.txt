A
              web-based Relational Database for Thermodynamic and Structure Data on
              Lipids


Selectively permeable membranes are an essential feature of living
              cells. The membrane is a bimolecular lipid leaflet in and on which are situated
              proteins and other molecules. Lipid mesomorphism, or liquid crystallinity,
              allows for the positioning of the membrane on the verge of bilayer stability
              thereby modulating
membrane function. Interest in the mesomorphic properties
              of biological and synthetic lipids within the biochemistry and biophysics
              communities has grown enormously in the past three decades. As a result, there
              exists a wealth of information on lipid phase behavior, much of which is
              scattered throughout the
literature. The objective of this proposal is to
              provide ready web access to these data, to lipid molecular structures and to
              the appropriate literature in a continuously updated relational database and a
              means for data submission and analysis over the web. The data come in two
              forms. The first refers to phase transition types, temperatures and enthalpies
              for lipids in different hydration states. The second concerns lipid miscibility
              represented graphically as
isobaric and isothermal phase diagrams. The project
              is cross-disciplinary in that it combines the efforts of a biochemist working
              on lipids and membrane structural biology and a computer scientist with
              database expertise.
