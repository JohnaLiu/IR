Abstract    :
              We propose here a national workshop of EOT-PACI (Education, Outreach, and
              Training-Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure) partners,
              leading colleges of education, innovative researchers, teacher educators,
              teachers, and scientists.  The workshop will establish collaborative pathways
              through which participants will research and develop sustainable strategies to
              integrate computational modeling and scientific visualization within science
              and math teacher preparation programs nationwide.
