Abstract    :
              Michael Fisher of the University of Maryland is cofunded by a grant from the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the Materials Theory
              Program to continue his basic theoretical research in statistical mechanics and
              the study of states of matter, phase transitions between these states, and
              related critical phenomena.  Specific problems to be studied include: 1) the
              origin and nature of crossover critical behavior observed experimentally in
              certain electrolytes that undergo a phase separation; 2) the role of symmetry
              in continuum fluids and the linear scaling fields that govern near-critical
              thermodynamics;  3) the refinement of finite-size scaling techniques for
              discriminating between universality classes in Monte Carlo simulations; 4) the
              exact analysis of multi-species ionic spherical models and of a novel
              compressible cell gas; 5) the study of universal relations between interfacial
              tension near a critical endpoint and special free energy functional that
              accommodate non-classical critical exponents; 6) the use of this free energy
              functional approach to compute universal critical adsorption and density
              profiles in the critical neighborhood;  7) the analysis of the forces exerted
              by molecular motors using a recently developed theory; and 8) the development
              of the mathematics needed for the treatment of molecular motor models that
              employs biased, linear, periodic random walks with waiting time distributions
              including branching and death processes.

Fisher's theoretical research will
              further the understanding of electrolyte solutions under various physical
              conditions.  Electrolyte solutions are important in many industrial and
              biological processes.   A novel extension of this research is the probing of
              how molecular motors move along linear tracks within cells to perform functions
              vital to the life of the organism.
