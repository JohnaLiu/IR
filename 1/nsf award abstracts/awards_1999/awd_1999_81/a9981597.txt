This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              between Martin G. Bakker of the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa and Claude
              Treiner of the University Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris, France involves
              investigations of surfactant adsorption, aggregation and adsolubilization on
              oxide surfaces.  The project includes the application of different techniques
              and observations of effects on counterions, surfactant structure, surface
              properties, and on the structure and properties of adsorbed surfactant
              aggregates.  In particular, the investigators will apply nitroxide spin probes
              to surfactants on surfaces.  U.S. and French graduate students would receive
              training in spectroscopy and other techniques and carry out some of the
              adsorption studies.

The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration
              expertise in spectroscopy and its application to studies of surfactant
              aggregates adsorbed on particle surfaces.  This is complemented by French
              expertise in surfactant chemistry, adsorption, isotherms, thermodynamics,
              calorimetry methods and techniques.  The project will advance understanding of
              surfactant adsorption and its impact in areas as diverse as separations, inks,
              paints, nanoscale devices, drug delivery, silicosis, and lung cancer.  In
              particular, surfactant adsorption studies have important implications for water
              treatment and environmental clean-up because of the enormous, public use of
              detergents, a well-known and typical surfactant.
