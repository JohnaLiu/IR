Abstract    :
              Professor Philip Coppens of the State University of New York at Buffalo is
              funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform technique
              development in X-ray diffraction with a strong theoretical component. 
              Transition metal compounds will serve as model systems.  Time-resolved
              crystallography will be performed on a microsecond timescale, allowing
              structural characterization of short-lived photo-intermediates.  Another major
              area of innovation is the determination of charge distributions in crystals.
              Thus, static diffraction structure data is supplemented with charge density and
              polarizability information, and density functional theory is performed to
              enhance understanding of the experiments.  

X-ray diffraction is well-known
              as the sine qua non of structure-determining tools, capable of measuring
              extremely small changes in molecular geometry.  Despite being a mature field,
              X-ray diffraction is enhanced by this work, which presents innovations that
              will expand the knowledge of electronic structures of matter and the structural
              changes in molecules that occur on fast timescales.  Knowledge that is gained
              about the interaction of radiation with matter in the solid state will underpin
              future applications in materials science and technology.  International
              collaboration with the Slovak University of Technology will benefit the efforts
              of both countries to advance research in this area.
