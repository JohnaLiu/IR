This award supports the participation of American scientists in a
              U.S.-Japan seminar on Aqua Bio-mechanics, to be held in Hawaii from August
              28-30, 2000.  The co-organizers are Professors Theodore Wu at the California
              Institute of Technology, Pasadena and Professor Minoru Nagai at the University
              of Ryukyus in Japan.  The topic will cover aquatic locomotion of all sizes,
              from microorganisms to fishes and cetaceans, such that the viscous-inertial
              effects range the entire span known to fluid physics.  The biophysical interest
              will contain the microfibril mechanisms found in flagellar and ciliary
              locomotion, the muscular energetics of the various kinds of fish swimming, and
              the physiological metabolism of aquatic animals.  The seminar will comprise a
              series of topics delivered by specialists in the areas of physiology,
              microbiology, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, control, robotics, and
              branches of engineering.  

The objectives are to improve our understanding
              of how the various kinds of aquatic locomotion and mechanisms are developed and
              thriving, to analyze why such ranges of high efficiency are achieved, and to
              apply the existing and newly gained knowledge to further research and future
              technologies.  The Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve
              younger researchers as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas
              and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to
              advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative
              projects.  It is expected that information on proceedings of the meeting will
              be available in "Flui
