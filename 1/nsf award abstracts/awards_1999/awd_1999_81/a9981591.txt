Abstract    :
              
This research will continue a long-term study of the regeneration of ten
              ecologically-diverse tree species in tropical rain forest at La Selva
              Biological Station in Costa Rica. The TREES project, begun in 1983, combines
              annual high-precision diameter and height re-measurement with assessment of
              individuals microsite conditions, for hundreds of mapped trees spanning the
              size range form very small juveniles to the largest adults. Recent TREES
              research has focused on the influence of edaphic factors on tree species
              distributions, comparative diameter growth and height growth patterns among
              focal species, associations of demographic and ecological traits through life
              history, and tree growth responses to climate variation, particularly the
              increasing global temperature. Over the next two years, research will (1)
              extend the record of annual tree height and increment growth, (2) extend work
              on the relations of tree spatial distributions to edaphic factors, (3) quantify
              the time scale of suppression for most of these species, and (4) quantify the
              life history dynamics of one of the dominant trees in this forest, Pentaclethra
              macroloba. The TREES project has successfully addressed the considerable
              challenges of understanding the growth and demography of long-lived tropical
              forest trees. Continued measurement of demographic parameters will help to
              provide a direct link between global climate fluctuations, atmospheric CO2
              concentrations, and the growth and dynamics of tropic forest vegetation.
