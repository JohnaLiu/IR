	For many years the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis
              has hosted a major symposium in the fall of the year, on topics of interest to
              the broad community of evolutionary and systematic biologists. About 400
              researchers and students participate each year, and the proceedings of the
              symposium are published in the Annals of the garden within a year or so of the
              meeting. This award will continue support for the annual symposia, with
              attention to a range of timely research topics, methodological advances in the
              field, and the interface between science and policy. Starting in fall 2000, the
              symposium will explore the topic of species concepts (morphological,
              biological, and phylogenetic) and their implications for biodiversity inventory
              and conservation policy. Speakers are chosen to represent current research
              contributions to the field, and to cover a full range of taxa and
              methodologies, and with consideration for workforce diversity (ca. 40% of past
              attendees and speakers have been women). Timely publication of the proceedings
              volumes increases the impact of the symposia, and several of these have become
              landmark reviews of research in evolutionary and systematic biology, of wide
              use in upper-level college and graduate classes. As well, participants,
              especially students, make use of the immense library and herbarium resources at
              the Garden in conjunction with the two-day symposium, thus increasing the
              opportunities for interaction and networking.
