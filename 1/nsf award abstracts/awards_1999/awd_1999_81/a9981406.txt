Collaborative Research RUI:
               Introgression of Plant Resistance Traits: Selection on 
Hybrid Willows by an
              Herbivorous Slug


Orians and Fritz will study the importance of
              introgression in the evolution of adaptations.  They will test the hypothesis
              that adaptive plant resistance traits can be favored among hybrid willow
              genotypes due to selection by a herbivorous slug.  The system is a hybridizing
              pair of willow species that have broadly sympatric ranges, currently hydridize
              throughout their zone of overlap and appear to have undergone past
              introgression.  The PI's will make F2  progeny from pure parents of each willow
              species and then subject some of these progeny to herbivory by the introduced
              slug, A. fasciatus. Preliminary evidence suggests that slug herbivory and
              mortaility of seedlings is related to plant chemistry. The first experiment
              will test if slug herbivory causes selection favoring  F2 phenotypes with
              higher concentrations of phenolic glycosides. Experiment two will involve
              determination of the chemical basis of selective slug feeding among F2 progeny
              compared to parentals.  For Experiment 3, the PI's will measure the resistance
              of selected and control F2 progenies to two other major willow phytophages,
              Japanese beetles and willow leaf rust.  This will determine if there are
              ecological costs of selection for higher resistance to slugs in F2's ,or, if
              resistance to slugs is synergistic or independent of resistance to these other
              species.  Experiment 4 will include two generations of backcrossing and
              selection by slugs to determine if phenolic glycoside traits persist in
              backcrosses and improve the fitness of some genotypes relative to non-selected
              backcrosses to the willow S. eriocephala.  This experiment will directly test
              the Introgression model, and will permit tests of allocational and ecological
              costs among introgressed plants with different chemical defenses.
