Abstract    :
              Allyl ethers are a class of compounds that can be very easily prepared using
              readily available and inexpensive starting materials.  However, this class of
              compounds has found very little practical or commercial use since they cannot
              be effectively polymerized by existing techniques.  Employing a newly
              discovered metal catalyst system, allyl ethers can be readily and efficiently
              polymerized to high molecular weight polymers that have potential uses for a
              variety of plastics applications.  The goals of this proposal are to conduct
              studies to understand the mechanism by which the present catalyst system
              functions with a view towards further improving it as well as for the
              development of even more effective catalysts.  In addition, the range of the
              scope of this new polymerization will be extended to other classes of
              potentially attractive monomers.  Using the present catalyst system, films and
              castings of high molecular weight poly(allyl ethers) will be made and
              characterized.  The PI hopes to attract industrial interest in these materials
              and to assist in their commercial development.  During the course of the
              project, several graduate students and postdoctoral coworkers will be trained
              in this new area of polymer technology.
