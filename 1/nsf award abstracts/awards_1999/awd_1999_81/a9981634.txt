By its very nature, hybrid lethality involves interactions
              among genes.  Hybrid lethals do not cause lethality in their own genetic
              background, but do cause lethality in hybrids, due to negative interactions
              among genes from the different species.  For this reason, genetic studies of
              hybrid lethals can be used to uncover a "web" of genetic interactions. This
              project will investigate the genetic basis of hybrid lethality between two
              species of Nasonia insects. This insect is particularly suited for studying
              complex gene interactions because the males are haploid (have only one set of
              chromosomes), making the genetic analysis much more simple.  Basic objectives
              are to (a) genetically characterize sets of interacting genes that cause hybrid
              lethality and (b) fine-scale map hybrid lethals for future cloning. 

The
              long-term objectives of this research are to clone and sequence genes involved
              in hybrid lethality and to determine how these genes interact. Results will
              yield important information on the nature of genetic interactions that cause
              lethality.  In addition, these studies could yield novel genes and gene
              interactions not detected by traditional mutational genetic approaches. Because
              of the surprising conservation of gene function found across diverse organisms
              (including from insects to humans),  gene interactions found in Nasonia could
              also occur in mammals, including humans.
