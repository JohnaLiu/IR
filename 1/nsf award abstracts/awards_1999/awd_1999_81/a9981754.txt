Abstract    :
              The National Research Council will conduct a study that will explore the
              fundamental challenges in computer science, illuminating the kinds of research,
              their breadth and depth, associated with the vitality of the field.  The
              project will emphasize, by illustrating those challenges in accessible form,
              the opportunities in computer science, highlighting key hard problems for
              future research in the field.  It is intended to motivate more research among
              computer scientists (current and potential) and to generate better
              understanding of computer science research opportunities among the scientific
              community at large and policy makers.  Broad input and discussion will feed a
              process of expert focusing and articulation of the intellectual core of
              computer science.  The project will culminate in a detailed report and a
              popularly accessible summary statement.
