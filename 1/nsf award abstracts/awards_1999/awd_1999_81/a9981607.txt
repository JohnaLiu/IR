The proposed research follows upon current research on
              mycorrhizae and ecophysiology of planted trees in seasonal tropical forest.
              Defining measurable goals for restoration is one of the central issues in
              restoration ecology, and is especially problematic in species rich and
              disturbed systems such as seasonal tropical forests. Designer communities will
              be established to initiate succession in two sites, and measure the feedbacks
              that developing communities have on 1) ecophysiological characteristics of
              trees over time, 2) biodiversity of colonizing plant species, 3) mycorrhizal
              fungal diversity and effects on plant growth, and 4) soil properties. Because
              of the high beta diversity in tropical forest, the original species composition
              can not be duplicated, but species with defined ecophysiological
              characteristics can be selected that may either slow or hasten succession.
              These characteristics include fast and slow-growing plants, sun and shade
              plants, large and small-seeded species, drought tolerance, C/N of leaf tissue,
              wood density, and others. Three kinds of communities will be established, late
              seral, early seral, and a mix of seral species. Experiments will test the
              hypothesis that the growth rate and seral status of the managed community will
              have different feedbacks on community and soil properties. The rate of canopy
              closure will vary, as will animal seed dispersers and diversity of plant
              colonization. Overall, this project will provide needed information on the
              value of designer communities as a mechanism to direct succession and restore
              native vegetation to degraded tropical lands.
