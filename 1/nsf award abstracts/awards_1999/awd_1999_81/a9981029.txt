Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)


In this "proof of concept" project, modules in
              geometry and abstract algebra for prospective teachers are being developed that
              integrate the two areas and emphasize connections between pre-college and
              undergraduate mathematics. The project is designed to address a need for
              programs that provide prospective teachers the opportunity to make connections
              between prior knowledge and future tasks, and to enable them to construct new
              mathematical and pedagogical knowledge by engaging in the teaching and learning
              of mathematics. The project will design integrated units in geometry and
              abstract algebra that focus on the basic results that provide the underpinnings
              for secondary school mathematics. The units will incorporate school-based field
              experiences.

University mathematics faculty, secondary school teachers,
              graduate students, and undergraduates will participate together in professional
              development activities that tie mathematics content and pedagogy together at
              the pre-college and university levels. Evaluation will provide feedback on the
              success of the project as well as insights on how undergraduates (in
              particular, prospective teachers) develop an understanding of abstract
              mathematics. Results from the "proof of concept" project will inform the
              development of a full curriculum based on the concept. Additional sources will
              be explored for funding of the full development.
