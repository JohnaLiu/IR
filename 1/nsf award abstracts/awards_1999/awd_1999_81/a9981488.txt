This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              environmental geochemistry involves J. Kirk Cochran of the State University of
              New York at Stony Brook and Alain Veron of the Centre Europeen de Recherche et
              d'Enseignement de Geosciences (CEREGE) in  Marseilles, France.  The
              investigators will determine the history of input rates and sources of stable
              lead to coastal areas.  Archived samples from salt marshes in the northeastern
              United States, and from Italy will be analyzed for isotopes of lead to
              determine their sources.  Previous research by the U.S. investigator has
              established chronologies of accumulation and lead flux for each site.  These
              samples will be complemented by the collection of two cores from salt marshes
              located in the Rhone Delta in Southern France.  Chronologies and stable lead
              concentrations from these sites will be analyzed at CEREGE.  The U.S.
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in geochronology and use of
              natural radionuclides as tracers.  This will be complemented by French
              expertise in lead isotopes.  The project will advance understanding of sources
              of coastal atmospheric pollution. 

This award represents the U.S. side of a
              joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the U.S. 
              investigator to collect samples, work on the analyses of lead, and present a
              short course in France.  The CNRS will support the visits of the French
              researchers to the United States.
