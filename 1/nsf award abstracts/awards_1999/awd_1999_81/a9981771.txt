The objective of the project is to maintain an
              up-to-date searchable database of UNOLS, FOFCC and international research ship
              schedules and ship characteristics. The database provides a comprehensive
              up-to-date and searchable listing of the national and international research
              ships. Ship schedules and vessel characteristics aid the researcher in
              preparing optiomin plans and schedules for research projects support by the
              various federal and international agencies. The information is readily
              accessible through the World Wide Web.

The NSF,  NOAA, ONR, NAVO and USCG
              share the cost of this service to the research community. OCEANIC continues to
              improve and upgrade the electronic scheduling procedures that provides the user
              with current information and access to the world oceanographic fleet.
