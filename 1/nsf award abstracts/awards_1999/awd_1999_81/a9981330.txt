Plants vary in their timing of availability to
              insects. Often insects can emerge either at the proper time to use one host
              plant or another, but not both. The role of timing, or phenological,
              differences in limiting alternate host-plant use by the goldenrod gall fly will
              be examined. The goals are to determine whether gall-fly emergence time limits
              the use of an alternate host plant and whether there is potential for
              evolutionary change in the emergence time of gall flies. In greenhouse and
              field experiments, plant age and fly emergence time will be manipulated, and
              insect choice and survival on the normal and alternate host plants will be
              assayed. Field experiments will reveal whether early emerging flies would have
              an advantage when using the alternate host. The field emergence times of
              parents and their offspring will be recorded to determine whether there is
              genetic control of emergence time. 

This study of the role of timing in host
              switching is important because new species may be formed through a shift in the
              resources used by some members of a species. This mechanism of new species
              formation may be crucial in many groups of organisms, and knowledge of the
              processes that form new species is fundamental to understanding patterns of
              species diversity.  Such host shifts may lead to unintended consequences when
              biological control organisms shift to native plants.
