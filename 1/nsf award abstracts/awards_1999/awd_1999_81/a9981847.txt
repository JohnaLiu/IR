Abstract    :
              Ilan Benjamin of the University of California in Santa Cruz is supported by the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in his continuing research on
              liquid/liquid and liquid/vapor interfaces.  He employs equilibrium and
              non-equilibrium molecular dynamics computer simulations to consider three
              liquid interfacial systems that are important for their potential in furthering
              our understanding of the unique interface environment.  The three specific
              projects are 1) photodissociation of species adsorbed at the liquid/vapor
              interface; 2) charge transfer reactions using a realistic electrical double
              layer ionic distribution at a liquid/liquid interface; and 3) spectroscopy and
              reactivity of attached chromophores at an interface between water and a
              self-assembled organic monolayer.

The systems that Dr. Benjamin will study
              all have a potentially broad impact on such areas as environmental science and
              electrochemistry.  In addition, a significant amount of experimental data is
              available through the work of others, and these studies will provide a
              much-needed basis for comparison and interpretation.
