Abstract    :
              The subfamily Nicrophorinae is a relatively small group of beetles, currently
              around 65 species, that has long been recognized as exceptional because of the
              elaborate and unusual biparental care behaviors displayed by members of the
              subfamily's largest genus, Nicrophorus.  With potentially more than 90% of the
              taxa discovered, and with so many active behavioral, ecological, and
              conservation research programs, taxonomic resolution of the phylogenetic
              relationships among species is especially critical and needed.  The project is
              focused on completing the species descriptions, illustrations, taxonomic
              catalog, distribution maps, and keys to all species.  All data will be made
              available on the web.  Genomic DNA will be archived for future use, and for
              molecular level testing of several hypotheses related to the evolution of the
              group and the behavioral complexity observed among these beetles.
