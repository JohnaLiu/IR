Abstract    :
              

The purpose of the award is to provide for the continued operation and
              development of Toolik Field Station. Toolik Field Station, has been a premiere
              site of long term Arctic research in the United States for twenty years,
              supporting biological, hydrological geological and atmospheric investigations
              on the unique Arctic terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem.  The agreement will
              provide the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University Of Alaska, Fairbanks
              a stable funding and planning environment to develop and operate Toolik Field
              Station. 

Toolik Field Station provides support to approximately 30 projects
              each field season.  The summer field season lasts from early May to the end of
              August.  Visits outside the main season are also supported on a self-service
              basis in a winter facility. The total annual load on the facility averages
              3,500 science user days involving up to 200 research team members, with a peak
              of 70 users in camp at one time.
