Abstract    :
              The moth family Arctiidae represents a model system for investigating the
              relative roles of natural and sexual selection in molding courtship and
              defensive behaviors.  During their evolution, two different defense signals
              (aposematism, ultrasound) have been incorporated independently into courtship
              behaviors.  Plant derived chemicals are sequestered and used for defense in
              larvae and adults, and one class of these, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, have been
              incorporated into male courtship pheromones in many species.  Another defense
              signal, ultrasound, is used by adults to deter bat predation.  The second
              defense mode is then incorporated into courtship behaviors of some arctiid
              species.  To date, our ability to study the evolution of tiger moth defense and
              mating signals has been hampered by the lack of modern systematic studies at
              all taxonomic levels of the family.  The proposed work will comprise
              revisionary systematic and comparative biology components.  Precise
              descriptions of arctiid male courtship and ultrasound producing structures will
              be obtained, and systematic tree derived using these and other data.
