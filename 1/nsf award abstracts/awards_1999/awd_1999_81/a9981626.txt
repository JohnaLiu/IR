Ramdas

This award supports Dr. Anant K. Ramdas and a graduate
              student from Purdue University in a collaboration with Harald Pascher of the
              Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Bayreuth, Germany.  The
              collaboration studies the collective and localized excitations in the ternary
              and quaternary alloys of II-VI diluted magnetic semiconductors.  Experimental
              investigations involve spontaneous Raman scattering and coherent Stokes-Raman
              studies supplemented with modulation techniques, photoluminescence, and Fourier
              transform spectroscopy.  Magnetic interactions in the diluted magnetic
              semiconductors, controlled by the concentration of the magnetic ions or by the
              dimensionality in sub-micron quantum well structures manifest themselves in a
              spectacular manner in numerous phenomena, such as the Faraday and Voigt effect,
              Raman-electron paramagnetic resonance, and Raman-anti-ferromagnetic resonance. 
              This award adds a third year of research to a two-year award that has already
              produced significant results, several publications, and excellent experience
              for several Purdue graduate students.
