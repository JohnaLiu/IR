Abstract    :
              Reactive nitrogen species play an important role in tropospheric photochemistry,
              controlling ozone formation, affecting the concentration of hydroxyl radicals,
              and contributing to deposition of acids and nutrients. Forested areas in the
              United States present a major sink for reactive nitrogen through dry
              deposition, attributed mainly to nitric acid.  This project utilizes a newly
              developed a newly developed dual tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer to
              make eddy correlation flux measurement of nitrogen dioxide and nitric acid
              deposition at Harvard Forest.  The goal is to test ideas about mechanisms
              controlling partitioning among of nitrogen oxide species and their ultimate
              removal from the atmosphere.  The observations will produce new information on
              seasonal and interannual variability in the reactive nitrogen budget, and
              quantify an important component of acid deposition to forest ecosystems.  This
              research is a collaborative effort with Mark Zahniser, Aerodyne Research, Inc.
