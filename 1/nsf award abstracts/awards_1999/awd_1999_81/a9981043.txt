Abstract    :
              Physics (13) This project is integrating computer technology into an
              introductory physics laboratory that reinforces quantitative problem solving
              and preparing the work for national dissemination. The primary goals are to:
              (1) optimize laboratory problems to address students' robust problem-solving
              difficulties: and (2) prepare these problem-solving laboratories for national
              dissemination. Secondary goals are to investigate: (1) modes of faculty
              development necessary for implementation and (2) the applicability of this
              approach to introductory chemistry laboratories. To accomplish these goals, the
              project is carrying out four primary activities: (1) technical development,
              primarily refining software interfaces using National Instruments' LabVIEW; (2)
              research and instructional development centering on student difficulties in
              physics problem solving; (3) evaluation focused primarily on guiding the
              development; and (4) faculty development preparing for national dissemination.
              Particular attention will paid to the effect on underrepresented minorities in
              the introductory physics class, especially women.
	The entire project will be
              under the guidance of part of the University of Minnesota Physics Education
              Group with the collaboration of University of Minnesota faculty members in
              Physics and Chemistry, together with physics faculty from Hamline University,
              Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and the University of St. Thomas.
	This
              project builds on work showing the technical and pedagogical feasibility of
              merging computer-based laboratories with cooperative group problem solving
              pedagogy under grant NSF DUE9651339. At its conclusion the project will result
              in: (1) software tools for a computer based problem solving laboratory that can
              be readily modified by adapters; (2) student laboratory manuals that can be
              modified by adapters; (3) an adapter's guide; (4) an evaluation of the
              effectiveness of the problem solving laboratory at three sites; and (5)
              national dissemination.
