Abstract    :
              This project is designed to test a novel and unique prediction concerning the
              role of divergent selection in the evolution of reproductive isolation by
              studying natural populations of the threespine stickleback.  Populations early
              in the speciation process should be more reproductively isolated when occuring
              in different environments compared to populations in similar environments.  The
              comparative portion of the proposed research program focuses on whether
              stream-resident and marine populations of stickleback are consistently ioslated
              and stream opoulations consistently compatible, despite independ origins and
              distant relationships. Further experiments will be conducted to test the effect
              of body size on mating patterns.  These investigations will constitute the most
              definitive test so far of parallel reproductive isolation in relation to
              environment, and lead potentially to the strongest evidence yet for the role of
              divergent selection in natural speciation.
