Abstract    :
              Ulrich Hansmann is cofunded with a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry and the Biophysics Program to develop of a generalized ensemble
              method for exploring the rugged energy landscapes found in proteins.  New  and
              improved algorithms will be developed for performing molecular simulations on
              proteins, and for the prediction of three dimensional structure for small
              peptides up to approximately 50 amino acids.  The algorithms should prove
              useful in studies of thermodynamics of protein folding, and for investigating
              observed structural transitions.  The PI has performed substantial testing of
              the new algorithms using Met-enkephalin as a benchmark, and will now extend the
              applications to larger systems including the chameleon peptide, Protein G, and
              a peptide fragment corresponding to the first 34 amino acids of human
              parathyroid hormone.

A fundamental understanding of the way in which
              proteins fold is one of the grand challenges of current times.  A theoretical
              understanding of this complex problem is made difficult by the high
              dimensionality and the ruggedness of the potential energy surface describing
              the protein conformational space.  The challenge is to find a global minimum on
              this complex surface using currently available computer technology.  Hansmann's
              research offers new ways of exploring this rugged landscape that will make the
              global minimum easier to locate.
