Abstract    :
              Chemical oxidations are sloppy processes on an industrial scale, 
and
              biological oxidations have been hampered by poor reactivity of 
enzymes and
              the need for expensive cofactors.  Improvement of 
these enzymes by directed
              evolution is likely, but require rapid 
and sensitive assays.  The goal of
              this project is to develop new 
technology for the rapid screening of
              oxygenase libraries.  The 
digital imaging combined with
              fluorescence-activated cell sorting 
will be used to screen large collections
              of mutations for the 
appropriate activity.  Horseradish peroxidase will be
              coexpressed 
with the oxygenase to create fluorescent tags from the
              
hydroxylated aromatics formed by the oxygenase.  By rapid 
screening of the
              large collections, the rare improvement can be 
detected and further upgraded.
