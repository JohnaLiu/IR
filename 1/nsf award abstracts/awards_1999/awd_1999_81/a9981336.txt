Abstract    :
              Jay Rasaiah of the University of Maine is supported by a grant from the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on
              condensed phase fluid systems.  Proposed research focuses on four topics: 1)
              ionic mobility and association, water structure and dynamics in supercritical
              solutions;  2) phase transitions of polar fluids; 3) intrinsic elasticity of
              DNA; and 4) structure and dynamics of water and ions in contact with
              hydrophobic surfaces and electrodes.  Rasaiah will use a combination of
              molecular simulations and formal theory to attack these problems.  Computer
              simulations involving water will use an extended SPC/E model that includes the
              effects of polarization.

Ionic solutions are of central importance in many
              biological and industrial processes.  A molecular level understanding of the
              properties of these solutions is the fundamental key to exploiting their use to
              solve a great number of scientifically important problems.  Rasaiah's research
              will help further the fundamental understanding of ionic mobility and
              association in supercritical solutions, and in solutions in contact with metal
              surfaces.  It will also further our understanding of the properties of DNA. 
              This work has a potential impact on a number of biologically and industrially
              important processes.
