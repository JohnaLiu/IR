Abstract    :
              This project is designed to distinguish among four competing hypotheses
              addressing clutch size variation in birds nesting in northern and southern
              hemispheres.  The PI will use comparative and experimental methods to test
              whether nest predation, food limitation, density, or adult mortality--and
              possible interactions--are important factors in affecting clutch size in birds.
               Eight pairs of species matched for phylogeny and ecology in Arizonan,
              Argentinan, and Venezuelan forests will be observed with controlled comparisons
              of species between tropics, north and south temperate forests.  Tests will
              include detailed measurement of life history traits (clutch size, numbers of
              broods, renesting effort, length of time between renesting attempts, nest
              predation rates, adult survival, incubation behavior, and nestling feeding
              rates) of coexisting bird species among sites to differentiate among the
              alternative hypotheses.
