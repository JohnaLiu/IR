This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              mathematical sciences involves Victor Nistor of Pennsylvania State University
              and Thierry Fack and Moulan Benameur of the University of Lyon.  The project,
              supported under the joint program of the National Science Foundation and the
              French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), is a study of algebras
              relevant to foliations.  The investigators will use homological methods
              (K-theory, Hochschild, and cyclic homology) in their study.  They are
              interested in obtaining index theorems and in studying the spectral invariants
              of operators acting along the leaves of foliations.  Their approach to index
              theorem for foliations will involve the bivariant Chern-Connes character of the
              pseudodifferential extension of operators along the leaves of
              foliations.

This award represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the
              NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will
              cover travel funds and living expenses of the U.S. investigator and the CNRS
              will support the visits of the French mathematicians to the United States.  The
              project takes advantage of complementary expertise, in particular, the French
              team's expertise in the proposed approach.  It will advance understanding of
              index theorems and other related topics.
