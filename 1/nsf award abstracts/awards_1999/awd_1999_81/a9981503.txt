Effects of an Introduced Pest on the Carbon
              and Nitrogen Dynamics of a Northern Hardwood Forest

One of the most severe
              stresses on forests of the eastern US is the introduction of exotic pests. The
              introduction and subsequent spread of the Beech Bark Disease (BBD) is
              irreversibly altering the northern hardwood forests that cover the uplands of
              most of the northeastern states. The BBD is initiated by a scale insect that
              wounds the bark of a tree, allowing entry of a fatal fungal disease. Because
              beech is one of the dominant trees of the northern hardwood forest, its decline
              is likely to seriously affect the functioning of the forest ecosystem. In this
              study, which will focus on the Catskill Mountains of southeastern NY, the
              investigators will measure the response to the BBD of the vegetation, soils,
              and basic ecosystem functions like productivity and nutrient cycling.  Dr.
              Lovett and colleagues will also investigate how the BBD interacts with another
              serious stress to these forests-overabundance of nitrogen delivered by nitrogen
              oxide air pollutants.
