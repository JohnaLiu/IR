Three fundamental questions for evolutionary biologists
              are: 1) How rapidly does evolution occur? 2) Is the pattern of change
              repeatable? 3) Are most changes historically contingent, or do the
              deterministic forces of natural selection dominate? The introduction of the
              European fruit fly, Drosophila subobscura, into North and South America in the
              late 1970's provides a unique opportunity to address these questions. Many
              traits, including genetic markers and body size, vary systematically with
              latitude among the ancestral European populations. Previous studies show that
              the North American flies have evolved similar latitudinal patterns in less than
              20 years. The studies funded by this award will investigate the South American
              populations and provide further information on the North American and European
              populations. This is a unique opportunity to observe evolutionary change as it
              occurs over a broad geographic range. 

Species introductions are currently
              reshaping much of Earth's biological diversity. Many studies assess the impact
              of introduced species on native populations. Evolutionary changes in the
              introduced species, however, have generally been neglected even though such
              changes ultimately determine the ecological impact of the invasion.
              Furthermore, these natural experiments demonstrate the evolutionary and
              ecological response of populations to novel habitats, which will help predict
              the impact of climate change on the distribution and abundance of agricultural
              pests and insect-borne diseases.
