Radio
              Astronomical Studies with the BIMA Array

This award supports research,
              technological development, and student education at the
              Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) Array.  BIMA consists of ten
              6.1-meter-diameter antennas located near Burney, California.  The  mission of
              BIMA is to carry out spectroscopic and continuum observations of astronomical
              objects in the frequency range 30-245 GHz.  The observatory was constructed
              with funds from the NSF and from private sources.  BIMA is presently one of two
              US facilities engaged in interferometric observations in the millimeter
              wavelength band (the other being the Owens Valley Millimeter Array, also funded
              by NSF).  

Over the next three years,  BIMA plans to carry out the following
              scientific programs: 

(i) High-resolution (0.15") imaging of  circumstellar
              disks at 1.3mm.
(ii) Measurement of  magnetic field strengths in dense
              molecular clouds via the Zeeman effect in the molecule CN.
(iii) Searches for
              galaxy clusters at any redshift, and derivation of the Hubble           
              Constant, using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.
(iv) Continuation of a CO
              imaging survey of nearby galaxies.

Planned technological developments
              include:

(i) Implementation of dual polarization l3mm MMIC receivers.
(ii)
              Broadening the IF bandwidth and developing a new broadband correlator.
(iii)
              Installing new water vapor monitors with cooled frontends.
(iv) Upgrading the
              antenna control system
