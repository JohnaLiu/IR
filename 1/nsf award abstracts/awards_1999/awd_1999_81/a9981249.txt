The Index to Plant Chromosomes is a compilation of
              original chromosome counts for plants published in the scientific literature
              throughout the world.  It is the only index of its kind and is a major
              abstracting service for the botanical community as well as a primary source of
              original chromosome information, a subject of unique importance in botany,
              horticulture, and agriculture.  It also functions as a general reference source
              for research in plant systematics.  The project is on-going and has resulted in
              four monographs so far.  Data are available on the internet through the
              Missouri Botanical Garden's TROPICOS database.
