Abstract    :
              Biological Science  (61)  This project adapts the unique and tractable ecology,
              genetics, physiology and biochemistry of an extremely halophilic (i.e., "salt
              loving") bacterium to a junior level teaching laboratory in molecular
              techniques.  It is based on pedagogical techniques outlined by the Johnsons
              (Johnson, D. W. and R.T. Johnson, 1993, Cooperative Learning and College
              Teaching Newsletter, 3:6-9), further detailed by Herreid (Herreid, C.F., 1998,
              BioScience 48:553-559).

This project accomplishes four objectives: 1)
              students are made aware of the importance and relevance of the ecology of the
              group of organisms used as models in the molecular techniques laboratory; 2)
              students learn that biology is a quantitative science, not solely an
              observational one; 3) all students participate equally in an authentic
              "hands-on" molecular biology laboratory; and 4) students are prepared for more
              sophisticated molecular experiments in an advanced senior level course and in
              independent, undergraduate research projects.  Students and faculty whose
              majors and backgrounds are traditionally not considered "molecular" in nature
              are welcomed and encouraged to enroll in the course.  In addition, a laboratory
              manual (both hard copy and Web-based) is being produced and disseminated, and
              bacterial strains and environmental samples are supplied for the asking.
