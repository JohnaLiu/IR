This work will develop mathematical models of selection and
              interaction among populations. Projects will address: (1) conditions conducive
              to cooperation or mutualism, using the theory of finite games with random
              payoffs; (2) mathematical and statistical methods to measure the diversity of
              probability distributions in population biology, and applications of these
              methods to data in demography, ecology and population genetics; (3) the
              combination of data and models on food webs, body sizes and species abundances
              to give insight into the dynamics and stability of ecological communities; (4)
              patterns in the spatial distribution of populations, human and non-human, and
              the connection of these patterns with environmental factors. In each area,
              models will suggest data analyses while the results of the data analyses will
              help to shape further models.

This work aims to provide new useful concepts,
              mathematical models, and statistical tools in population biology, as well as
              new empirical generalizations and insights from the application of the tools
              developed here. These insights may assist society in coping with problems of
              human and non-human population change, biological and social cooperation, and
              conservation. To give a single example, from topic (3), a better fundamental
              understanding of the dynamics and stability of ecological communities would
              assist societies in preventing undesirable extinctions or invasions by unwanted
              biological species.
