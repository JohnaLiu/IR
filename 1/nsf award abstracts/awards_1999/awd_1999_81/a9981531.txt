This one-year award will support US participation in a
              European Science Foundation workshop to take place at Green College, Oxford
              University, United Kingdom in November 1999.  The workshop involves US
              researchers' participation in the European Science Foundation's ongoing
              Tropical Canopy Programme, whose goals are to foster and enhance collaborative
              efforts on a European level to study and understand tropical forest canopies.
              The workshop has been organized on the US side by Nalini Nadkarni of Evergreen
              State College, and on the European side by Eduard Linsenmair at the University
              of Wuerzburg in Germany.  European researchers will be present from Germany,
              Denmark, The Netherlands, France, and the UK.  They will discuss the emergence
              of canopy research as an emerging science and its links to allied fields,
              present case studies of developing fields, and generate goals and strategies
              for canopy research.  The ultimate objective is to develop a coherent and
              integrative research planning process that will assist the canopy research
              community to formulate and implement large-scale and long-term collaborative
              canopy research in the future.
