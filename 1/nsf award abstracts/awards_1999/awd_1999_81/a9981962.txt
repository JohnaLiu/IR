Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to support the activities of the Natural
              Disasters Roundtable of the National Research Council, National Academies.  The
              initial request was for $50,000 out of a total of $165,000 for the 12-month
              period from October 1, 1999 through September 30, 2000.  The proposal was
              reviewed by the panel convened by Dr. Shih Chi Liu for proposals received under
              the infrastructure and information Systems program in the Division of Civil and
              Mechanical Systems.  The panel did not recommend the proposal for support,
              primarily because the reviewers wanted additional details on the proposed
              activities of the roundtable.  Subsequent to the panel review, Dr. Nelson
              attend the Natural Disasters Roundtable planning meeting, and Dr. Wallace me
              with Dr. Parker, PI for the proposal and Dr. Hamilton, Executive Director,
              Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and Resources, whic will oversee the
              Roundtable.  Based upon those discussions, a revised proposal with a new budget
              of $25,000 out of a total of $165,000 for the 12-month period from 1 July 2000
              to 30 June 2001 was submitted by the National Academies.  The revised workplan
              includes more specificity as to the participants in the Roundtable.  In
              particular, prominent engineers will be asked to serve, and the Roundtable will
              involve the Board on Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment of the
              Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems, National Research Council.
