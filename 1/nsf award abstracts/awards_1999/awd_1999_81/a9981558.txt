Schmidt

This award supports David Schmidt, two co-PIs,  and two
              graduate students from Kansas State University in a collaboration with Bernhard
              Steffan of the Department of Information Sciences at the University of
              Dortmund, Germany.  The collaboration studies, from two different perspectives,
              the automated validation of software.  The German and U.S. groups will
              integrate their open-tool architectures (Electronic Tool Integration at
              Dortmund and Bandera at Kansas State) into a unified platform that can support
              robust software validation experiments.  A repository for electronic tool
              integration will be created at Kansas State to make the service more readily
              available to U.S. researchers.  All research knowledge will be shared between
              the two groups, and will lead to development of high-level notations for
              finite-state software validation.
