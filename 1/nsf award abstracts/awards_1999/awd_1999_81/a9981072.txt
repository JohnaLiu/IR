	Regulatory genes play central roles in the evolution of
              developmental patterns and adaptation.  The molecular evolution of regulatory
              genes must have its origins in molecular variation that occurs within distinct
              species.  Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of these developmental
              control genes requires investigating their evolution at the level of
              populations, where this variation has its origins and where genetic forces play
              themselves out to determine the fates of alternate alleles.  This project will
              study the molecular population genetics of four floral regulatory loci
              (ASAPETALA1-A and -B, and ASAPETALA3/TM6-A and -B) within the Hawaiian
              silversword alliance, a premier example of a plant adaptive radiation.  Our
              study will explore the dynamics of regulatory gene evolution in Dubautia
              arborea and D. ciliolata, two recently-diverged species within the
              rapidly-evolving group.  We propose to test hypotheses on the historical forces
              that shape the diversification of genes which control plant morphology, and on
              the selective forces that drive regulatory gene evolution at the interface of
              speciation.  

The results of this work will allow us to better understand
              the forces that drive gene and genome evolution, which in turn will help inform
              efforts in fields as disparate as crop breeding, plant conservation and genomic
              analysis.
