Astronomical Research with the Owens Valley Millimeter Array

This
              award supports research, technological development, and student education at
              the Owens Valley Millimeter Array.  The Array consists of a six
              10.4-meter-diameter antennas located near Bishop, California.  The  mission of
              the Owens Valley Millimeter Array of the is to carry out spectroscopic and
              continuum observations of astronomical objects in the frequency range 30-245
              GHz.  The observatory was constructed with funds from the NSF and from private
              sources.  The Owens Valley Millimeter Array  is presently one of two US
              facilities engaged in interferometric observations in the millimeter wavelength
              band (the other being the BIMA array, also funded by NSF).  

Over the next
              three years, the Owens Valley Millimeter Array plans to carry out the following
              scientific programs: 

(i) Searches for CO and continuum emission from high
              redshift galaxies.
(ii) Sub-arcsecond resolution mapping of dense gas in
              galactic nuclei.
(iii) Molecular line and continuum mosaics of cluster-forming
              molecular cloud cores.
(iv) Multi-line surveys of T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars
              on 0.4" scales.
(v) A survey of protoplanetary disks observed in the near
              infrared with HST.

Planned technological developments include:

(i)
              Implementation of dual polarization receivers.
(ii) Completing the integration
              of the new COBRA broadband correlator.
(iii) Installing new water vapor
              monitors with cooled frontends.
