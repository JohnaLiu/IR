This research will characterize spontaneous mutations affecting
              traits of Arabidopsis thaliana, an annual plant of the mustard family.  The
              primary goals are to determine the mutation rate, to describe the distribution
              of mutational effects, and to assess genetic modes of action for spontaneous
              mutations.  These studies will employ 117 mutation-accumulation lines that all
              derive from a single highly inbred progenitor, which serves as the genetic
              baseline.  The lines have been advanced for 25 generations.  Large-scale assays
              will be conducted using plants representing each line at several generations of
              line advancement.  Measures of plant size, developmental timing, and
              reproduction will be obtained for each individual.  The design of some assays
              varies environmental conditions so that environmental sensitivity of effects of
              mutation can be evaluated.  Formal genetic crosses between lines will also be
              conducted to determine the degree of genetic dominance of mutations.  Newly
              developed statistical approaches to inferring mutational properties will be
              applied to these data.  

Spontaneous mutation is widely recognized as a
              genetic process fundamentally important in evolution, yet quantitative
              information about spontaneous mutation is extremely limited.  Results of this
              research will inform predictions about, for example, evolution of ecological
              specialization, evolution of mating systems, and rates of
              extinction.
