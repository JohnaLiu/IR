The goals of this project are to measure in the zebrafish,
              a vertebrate model organism: (1) the number of recessive lethals (an extreme
              kind of harmful mutation) in the genome and (2) the rate that such harmful
              mutations arise. The number of lethal mutations carried in the genome will be
              estimated by measuring the fraction of lethal-free offspring that are produced
              using a new technique that makes individuals have only a single copy of the
              genome and so express all lethal mutations. The rate at which lethal mutations
              arise will be measured by making individuals in which both copies of the genome
              are identical (and thus carry no recessive lethals) and then measuring the
              number of lethals that arise in the next generation.  

This study will
              provide the first data in any vertebrate on the genomic rate at which new
              harmful mutations arise. Among animals, data on the genomic rate of the new
              appearance of harmful mutations is available only for fruit flies. Knowledge of
              the rate that harmful mutations arise is essential to understanding
              evolutionary processes in living organisms, in managing small populations of
              endangered animals, as well as in assessing health risks in humans. While it is
              known that an average human newborn carries ~100 de novo mutations, it is not
              clear what fraction of them are harmful and so might contribute to miscarriage
              and a variety of hereditary diseases.
