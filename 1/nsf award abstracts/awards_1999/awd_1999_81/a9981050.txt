Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

This Proof-of-Concept proposal is to develop two,
              four-week sample modules that are intended to demonstrate the feasibility of
              materials. The modules are from two mathematics courses designed for the
              preparation of elementary school teachers. These courses are part of a
              successful "study-in-one discipline" program that results in over one-third of
              University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)'s elementary education majors graduating
              with a specialization in teaching mathematics. Each module is also closely
              linked to nationally-recognized instructional materials developed at UIC with
              NSF support. The modules will be used to help lay the groundwork for
              development of the full proposal, including recruitment of field test sites and
              a publisher.

Two modules are being developed and field tested at UIC over a
              one year period beginning in summer 2000. The first module is focusing on
              integrating mathematics and science and is building from materials developed by
              the Teaching Integrated Mathematics and Science (TIMS) Project. This module
              will be developed in summer 2000 and field tested during the fall semester. The
              second module, which focuses on geometry and geometric measurement, is
              associated with materials developed by the UIC Maneuvers with Mathematics (MWM)
              Project. This module is being developed during the Fall 2000 and will be field
              tested in the spring semester. Each module includes student text materials,
              assessment materials, and instructor's guides-all prepared in CD-ROM format. In
              addition to their use as a prototype for the larger development proposal, the
              modules are  being written so that they can be disseminated as standalone units
              in mathematics teacher preparation courses.
