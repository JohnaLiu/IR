Abstract    :
              	A Conference on Stochastic Analysis and Harmonic Analysis will be held at
              Northwestern University from June 26-30, 2000. The conference is part of an
              Emphasis Year in Probability Theory in the Department of Mathematics at
              Northwestern. The funds will be used primarily for support of women and junior
              researchers to allow them to attend the conference.
