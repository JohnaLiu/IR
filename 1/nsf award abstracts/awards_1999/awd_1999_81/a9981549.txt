Abstract    :
              This project will attempt to organize the topical matter of an academic
              discipline in a comprehensive and innovative way by creating a dynamic
              reference work of exceptionally large scope using information technologies. 
              The goals of the project are: - to design and implement a customized work-flow
              system through which academic philosophers can collaboratively write, maintain,
              track and summarize the new ideas being published in print and electronic
              media- to produce a comprehensive reference work useful not only to scholars,
              but to the general public as well- to develop XML standards for the materials
              of philosophy applicable to other topical areas research funds from the Digital
              Libraries Initiative would be part of a larger base of support for the project
              and targeted toward advances in work-flow system development and building user
              interface tools that can fully exploit the features of a dynamic reference
              work. Examples of these include evolving concept maps, dynamic
              cross-referencing based on user needs, etc.  The methods used to achieve this
              can serve as an example for other disciplines in the humanities and
              sciences.
