Abstract    :
              This research project will conduct long-term observations of the mesosphere and
              lower thermosphere of the atmosphere for changes in temperature.  The
              temperature will be determined from wind and optical measurements taken with
              meteor radars at four sites in the Arctic: Barrow, Alaska, Kangerlussuaq,
              Greenland, and Dixon and Heiss Islands, Russia. The measurement program is
              timed to take advantage of a NASA satellite measurement program that will focus
              on the same part of the atmosphere.  Because the introduction of greenhouse
              gases influences atmospheric temperature, the long-term measurements will be
              affected by anthropogenic as well as natural changes in temperature.  The
              researchers will attempt to separate the two signals and use temperature
              changes caused by introduction of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to provide
              a warning that greenhouse gases are affecting atmospheric temperature. 
              Observed temperature changes will be used to examine the dynamic coupling of
              the middle and lower atmospheres as well as the physical processes that affect
              changes in the thermal structure of the atmosphere.  The long-term observations
              will be an important contribution to understanding of the long time-scale
              evolution of the middle/lower atmosphere at a time when the Arctic appears to
              be undergoing major changes in response to a climatic warming.
