Perfecto will investigate the
              function of biological diversity in a coffee agroecosystem in southern Mexico. 
              The research will focus on processes associated with the reduction of herbivory
              by vertebrate and invertebrate predators and their impact on coffee
              productivity.  The main objectives are to: 1) quantify the impact of predation
              on the assemblage of arthropods in coffee plants by three groups of
              insectivores (birds, ants and spiders), 2) quantify the impact of this
              insectivory on cumulative herbivore damage, as well as plant reproductive
              output, 3) determine the change in abundance and diversity of different
              predators along a gradient of management intensity and relate this to different
              levels of impact of predators on arthropod populations and herbivore damage, 4)
              assess the seasonal variation of the impact of predators on herbivores of
              coffee along an intensification gradient, and 5) examine some of the major
              interactions among the 3 major groups of predators.  The general hypotheses
              guiding this work are that top down control of agroecosystems can limit
              herbivory and that diversity & abundance of predators affect the degree of
              limitation.
