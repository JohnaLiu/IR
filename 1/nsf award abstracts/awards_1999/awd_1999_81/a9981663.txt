Title:	Mammalian Herbivores as Consumers and Fertilizers -
              Consequences For 
	Community Structure and Ecosystem Dynamics

Mammalian
              herbivores can be extremely influential in terrestrial systems, although they
              commonly have variable and often opposing effects on plant communities and
              ecosystems.  Identifying the causes of this variation is central for efforts to
              understand and generalize about the effects of these herbivores in nature. 
              This research considers two fundamentally different herbivore species along the
              coast of northern California, and addresses four questions: 1) Do black-tailed
              deer and jackrabbits have different effects on plant communities and ecosystems
              through their activities as consumers versus fertilizers, through the
              deposition of metabolic wastes?  2) Does the relative importance of consumer
              and fertilizer effects vary between dune and grassland habitats?  3) Do the
              contrasting feeding preferences of deer and jackrabbits lead to different
              effects on plant communities and soil fertility in the same coastal system? 
              And 4) Through long-term browsing on a nitrogen-fixing shrub, do herbivores
              decrease soil fertility in a nutrient-deficient dune system?  This project will
              make a significant contribution to understanding vertebrate-plant
              interactions.
