Na-K-Cl ion transporters represent a family of cell membrane
              proteins that transport sodium (Na+), potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl-) ions in
              or out of cells.  The ion transporter protein plays an important role in salt
              reabsorption and secretion in kidney.  It also functions in control of cell
              volume in many types of cells.  Brain cells, particularly neurons (nerve
              cells), express an abundant level of the ion transporter protein.  However,
              little is known why nerve cells express the ion transporter protein and what
              its function is.  The objectives of this project are to study whether the ion
              transporter protein regulates nerve cell Cl- concentration, and whether the ion
              transporter is involved in control of nerve cell volume.  Moreover, we want to
              understand how the ion transporter activity is controlled in nerve cells. 
The
              cellular ion homeostasis (balance) in the brain is a general prerequisite for
              adequate neuronal function.  Disturbance of ion homeostasis would lead to
              cessation of functional activity of nerve cells.  In addition, nerve cell
              volume needs to be tightly regulated because of a restrict volume of the skull.
              Therefore, it is important to understand whether the ion transporter
              contributes to control ion homeostasis and cell volume in brain.  The results
              of this project will significantly enhance our knowledge about the role of the
              Na-K-Cl cotransporter in nerve cells and may provide insights to understand
              causes of the breakdown of ion homeostasis under pathological conditions, such
              as epilepsy (brain seizure) and brain edema (swelling).
