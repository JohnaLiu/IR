The alien Chinese Tallow Tree
              is a major invader in the Gulf Coast which aggressively displaces native
              plants. This research will focus on understanding the mechanisms that allow
              this species to establish in a broad range of Gulf Coast ecosystems (urban
              habitats, prairies, hardwood forests and floodplain forests), to out-compete
              and displace native vegetation, and to maintain self-replacing monocultures.
              Experiments will be replicated across major landscape types to examine: (1) the
              relationship between severity of alien plant invasion and lack of herbivores
              and diseases; (2) the importance of resource alterations in governing invasion
              severity; and (3) how local recruitment limitation affects alien plant
              invasion.  Understanding the mechanisms of plant invasion is critically
              important to both society, with increasing economic and political impacts of
              alien species, and ecology because invasion plays a key role in community
              development and ecosystem function.
