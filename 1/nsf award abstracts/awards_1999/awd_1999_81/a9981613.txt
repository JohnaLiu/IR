This award supports Kelvin Chu and a graduate student from the
              University of Vermont, and State Agricultural College in a collaboration with
              Guenter Fritzsch of Max Planck Institute in Frankfurt, Germany.  The
              collaboration will use x-ray crystallography to determine the changes in
              protein conformation that occur as a result of the charge separation which
              drives energy transfer across cell membranes.  A high-resolution structure of
              light-induced, charge -separated states will reveal the precise conformational
              changes responsible for charge conduction and stability of the configuration. 
              By studying the structure as a function of temperature and illumination
              wavelength, they will be able to address issues concerning the dynamics and
              function of electron transfer and photosynthesis in biomolecules.  The
              collaboration will also include contributions from Ilme Schlichting of the Max
              Planck Institute in Dortmund.
