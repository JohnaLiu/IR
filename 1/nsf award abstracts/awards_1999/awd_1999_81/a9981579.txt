This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              chemistry involves Daniel R. Talham and a graduate student from the University
              of Florida, and Bruno Bujoli, Fabrice Odbel and a graduate student from the
              University of Nantes' Laboratory of Organic Synthesis.  The project is
              supported under a joint program of the National Science Foundation and the
              French National Center for Scientific Research.  The principal aim is to
              develop a new approach to organizing functional assemblies of molecules on
              solid surfaces for the purpose of catalysis.  The collaboration combines a
              method for surface confinement, developed by the U.S. investigator, with the
              French investigator's expertise in molecular engineering and catalysis. 
              

This award will support the incremental costs of the international
              collaboration; that is, the travel to Marseilles, France and subsistence
              expenses of the U.S. investigator and graduate student.  The project is
              expected to result in the development of new heterogeneous catalysts, prepared
              by the directed assembly of molecular units onto solid supports, and will
              advance fundamental understanding of the proposed systems.
