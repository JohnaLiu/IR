This renewal proposal will continue a broad-based program
              in computational materials theory at Rutgers, supporting fundamental research
              on the structural and electronic properties of insulating materials.  Special
              emphasis will be placed on the development of novel techniques for the
              computation and analysis of these properties.  In particular, ultrasoft
              pseudopotential methods will be applied to study the structural, electronic,
              and dielectric properties of crystalline and amorphous insulating oxides.  In
              addition, a combination of first-principles and tight-binding methods will be
              used to investigate the dislocation core structure of III-V semiconductors.

The principal objective of this research award is to develop better
              computational methods to calculate the electronic and structural properties of
              materials using atomic-scale approaches.  The principal materials of interest
              include insulating oxides with technological application in electronic devices
              and structural materials, as well III-V semiconductors.  The research effort
              will be balanced between development of new methods, required to keep abreast
              of state-of-the-art methods, and application of these methods to practical
              problems in materials, the real motivation behind the entire effort.
