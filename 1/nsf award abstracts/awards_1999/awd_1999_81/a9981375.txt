This proposal supports a three year collaborative research
              project between Professor Roger Leblanc of the University of Miami and
              Professor Takeshi Hasegawa of the Kobe Pharmaceutical University in Japan.  The
              researchers will be undertaking a study of the molecular recognition formed in
              systematic molecular assemblies.  Infrared spectroscopy is a powerful technique
              to study the molecular structures and interactions of organized Langmuir
              monolayers and LB films.  The specific aim is to study the molecular
              recognition formed in systematic molecular assemblies at the air-water
              interface.  The researchers plan to develop a biosensor for the detection and
              monitoring of hazardous chemicals to human health using the Langmuir-Blodgett
              film technique.  The study will include both fundamental investigation and
              prototype development.  

The project brings together the efforts of two
              laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The
              planned activities are the focusing points in surface science and material
              science research aimed at the advanced development of nanotechnology.  Results
              of this research should lead to a better and healthier environment.  This
              research advances international human resources through the participation of a
              postdoc and graduate student.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology,
              this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international
              understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the
              research in scientific journals.
