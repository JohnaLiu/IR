The proposed research will integrate an
              important communication system, the advertisement call of frogs, with a
              phylogenetic approach in order to address the origin of frog vocalization, the
              rates of change in behavioral characters associated with vocalizations, and
              correlation of laryngeal shape change in the anatomical structures that produce
              the sounds.  A formerly accepted phylogeny of frogs suggests that the earliest
              frogs did not have a well-developed acoustic signaling mechanism.  According to
              a more recent hypothesis, the earliest frogs would indeed have had a
              well-developed communication system.  These two alternative scenarios will be
              tested using more complete samples of species of the primitve frogs and larger
              samples of characters, from DNA sequences.  There is a general bias that
              behavioral characters are more subject to change than other classes of data. 
              The presence of intense sexual selection on the male vocal signal suggests that
              the footprint of history may be obliterated by rapid evolution of call
              characters.  Thus, estimates of phylogenetic relationships derived from call
              characters will be very different from those derived from DNA sequences.  The
              generality of this observation will be tested using complete DNA sequences of
              selected genes for five groups of frogs widely distributed throughout North,
              Central, and South America.
