Abstract    :
              	This is a one-year standard award.  This proposal requests funds to support a
              workshop to promote Western Hemisphere collaboration in computer science and
              engineering to solve regional and global problems.  The meeting, to be jointly
              sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Organization of the
              American States, will be held in Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico between August
              10-12, 1999. The workshop will bring together leading computer science and
              engineering researchers and representatives of federal agencies from 34 Western
              Hemisphere countries (Canada, United States and Latin American and Caribbean
              nations).  The participants will discuss benefits and barriers to Western
              Hemisphere collaboration, identify projects that will serve as research
              testbeds for solving regional and global problems, and propose collaboration
              models to their success. The proposed workshop is expected to produce specific
              recommendations to establish a new multinational program to support Western
              Hemisphere collaboration in computer science and engineering.
