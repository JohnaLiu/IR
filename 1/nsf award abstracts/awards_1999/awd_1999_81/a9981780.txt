This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              evolutionary genetics involves Raymond B. Huey and a graduate student at the
              University of Washington, and Brigitte Moreteau and her research group at the
              Laboratory of Evolutionary Genetics of the French National Center for
              Scientific Research.  They will collaborate on studies of insect cold tolerance
              with a focus on the evolutionary physiology of fruit flies of the obscura group
              of Drosophila.   The investigators propose to use new statistical methods
              combined with rapid scoring in order to facilitate quantitative analyses of
              effects of temperature.

The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration
              expertise in phylogenetic approaches in physiological evolution and
              considerable research experience with Drosophila.  This is complemented by
              French experience and knowledge of Drosophila diversity.  The project also
              takes advantage of novel methods in quantitative analysis of temperature
              reaction that have been developed by the French team.  Their collaboration will
              advance understanding of the thermal sensitivity of insects and whether
              evolutionary patterns are predictable or are historically contingent.  It will
              elucidate whether insects can evolve rapidly in response to climate change.  
              This award will support the incremental costs of this international
              collaboration; that is, the travel to Paris, France and subsistence expenses of
              the U.S. investigator and graduate student.
