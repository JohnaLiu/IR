This award supports Wolfgang Bauer and junior researchers from
              Michigan State University in a collaboration with Horst Stoecker of the
              Department of Physics at the U. of Frankfurt, Germany.  The project will focus
              on a study of the phase transition in high-density baryon systems from a state
              in which quarks are confined to a state where quarks and the conveyors of the
              strong force which binds quarks together, gluons, act as free particles.  This
              transition is of great interest in modern high-energy nuclear physics, and the
              details of the transition from confined to unconfined state will be sought in
              this collaboration.  Each group brings unique and needed expertise to the
              problem of producing a realistic model of the phase transition which will, in
              turn, be of great importance in interpreting the experimental results that will
              come from the Large Hadron Collider in 2005.  Together, the groups will be able
              to address the exciting physics of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.
