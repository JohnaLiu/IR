Polymeric additives
              to Newtonian fluids are well recognized as a drag reducing agent in wall
              bounded flows.  The PI has proposed new studies to better elucidate the
              mechanistic bases for this phenomenon.  The peer comments, while positive in
              general, suggest substantive limitations in the research plan.  It has been
              elected, therefore, to provide a one-year bridging grant to permit initial
              results to be obtained.  It is expected that an improved proposal for regular
              funding will result.
