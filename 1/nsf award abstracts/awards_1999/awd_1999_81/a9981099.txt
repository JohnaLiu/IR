Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) This project integrates the undergraduate biology
              curriculum with a series of self-contained modules on genomics. The modules are
              portable to a variety of courses ranging from general education courses in
              science to introductory and advanced courses for majors. The design of the
              modules focuses on investigative science as a tool to teach critical thinking
              and problem solving as well as to inform students about the field of genomics
              and the great influence it is beginning to have on their lives. The five
              modules being produced include: sequence analysis of homologous genes; analysis
              of human microsatellites; sequencing of a model genome; sequence analysis of
              expressed sequence tags; and computational analysis of nucleic acid and protein
              sequences.
