     The investigator uses mathematical models to study
              dynamical
and biophysical mechanisms for the multiple modes of
              bursting
observed in pancreatic Beta-cells.  In pancreatic islets,
Beta-cells
              burst with a period of 10-30 seconds, while isolated
Beta-cells burst with
              periods of either 2-5 seconds or 1-2
minutes.  The primary goal of this
              project is to answer the
following questions: (1) How does a single oscillator
              (the
Beta-cell) produce such a wide range of bursting behaviors?  (2)
What
              biophysical mechanisms drive the different modes of
bursting?  (3) Why does
              the bursting behavior differ between
isolated cells and intact islets?  To
              address these questions the
investigator  develops a family of mathematical
              models that
employ several slow variables.  He studies how well these
              models
reproduce key electrophysiological and calcium imaging data
              from
isolated Beta-cells, cell clusters, and intact islets.
     Pancreatic
              Beta-cells are the only cells in the human body
that secrete insulin, a
              hormone required by other cells to
process sugars in the blood.  If Beta-cells
              function improperly
then late-onset diabetes occurs, the most common form
              of
diabetes.  Insulin is secreted from Beta-cells when the cells
generate
              electrical impulses, so understanding the electrical
activity of Beta-cells is
              crucial to understanding insulin
secretion.  For many years mathematical
              models have provided
insight into the complex electrical behavior of
              Beta-cells.  In
the current project, the investigator develops
              improved
mathematical models to understand how Beta-cells produce patterns
of
              electrical impulses that are key to normal insulin secretion.
Only when these
              normal patterns are understood can abnormal
electrical activity, and abnormal
              insulin secretion resulting in
diabetes, be understood.
