     Understanding the fluctuations in animal numbers is
              a
central issue in population biology that has far-reaching impact
on and
              implications for problems ranging from food production to
the conservation of
              species.  Nonlinear dynamics opens the way to
a new phase of population
              research in which theory and
experimentation focus on phenomena such as cycles
              and
quasi-periodicity, chaos and strange attractors, multiple
attractors and
              complicated basins of attraction, saddle sets and
their stable manifolds, and
              so on.  This interdisciplinary
project, in which Robert Costantino, Jim
              Cushing, Brian Dennis,
Robert Desharnais, and Shandelle Henson collaborate,
              covers a
spectrum of activities essential to testing nonlinear
              population
theory: the translation of the biology into the language
              of
mathematics and back again, the analysis of deterministic and
stochastic
              models, the development and application of statistical
techniques for the
              analysis of data, and the design and
implementation of biological experiments.
               A series of experiments
with flour beetles of the genus Tribolium provide
              rigorous
experimental tests of nonlinear phenomena.  Topics
              include
nonlinearity in the context of stochasticity, chaos and
population
              control, the impact of periodic environments on animal
abundance, demographic
              dynamics and natural selection,
nonequilibrium species interactions, and
              statistical questions
concerning parameterization and validation of models.
 
                 With a sound understanding of the underlying dynamics of
animal
              populations, ecologists can anticipate the consequences of
environmental
              degradation and learn better ways to manage natural
populations and control
              populations of pests.  For example, one of
the experiments suggests that, by
              taking advantage of the
"sensitivity to initial conditions" that is the
              hallmark of a
chaotic system, managers can dramatically decrease
              pest
population numbers without the use of chemical pesticides by
making
              small perturbations at critical times.  The marriage of
ecological theory and
              experiments by the interdisciplinary
research team leads to new techniques for
              the application of
mathematics to ecological problems.  The project is
              supported by
the Applied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics,
              and
Statistics programs in MPS and the Population Biology and
              Ecology
programs in BIO.
