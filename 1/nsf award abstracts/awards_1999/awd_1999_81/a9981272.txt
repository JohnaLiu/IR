Dr. Richard Drobnick of the University of South California
              requested $24,000 to support the participation of junior scientists from
              Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Korea and Chile in the Association of Pacific
              Rim Universities (APRU) Fellows Program on interdisciplinary perspective on the
              Asian Economic Downturn.  A series of  three "traveling" workshops will be held
              in three countries including discussion, and  synchronized field experience. 
              These workshops are co-sponsored by the Asia Foundation, which will provide
              organizational and local logistical support.  This project concerns one of the
              most important political and economic issues in Asia, and meets INT's goals on
              the involvement of junior scientists in international research.
