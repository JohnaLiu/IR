Top-down and bottom-up mechanisms of urban
              edge and fragmentation effects

Habitat fragmentation and edge effects due to
              urban and suburban development are among the principle threats to biological
              diversity.  The effects of habitat fragmentation are complex, diverse and
              pervasive.  They affect animal and plant populations through a number of
              interacting pathways.  The PI's prior work has shown that predation and
              parasitism on Rufous-crowned sparrow do not increase along urban edges in
              coastal sage scrub habitat that is fragmented by urban development in coastal
              suouthern California.   The research proposed here will investigate the
              generality of the previous findings by examining the rates of nest predation
              and brood parasitism in five focal species of birds that vary in nest placement
              (ground vs. shrub) and apparent sensitivity to fragmentation.  Four landscape
              settings that vary in degree of exposure to edge and fragmentation effects will
              be considered.  Rates of predation and parasitism will be compared across these
              landscape treatments.  The proposed work will also address bottom-up
              (food-driven) effects on fragmentation and edge by quantifying foraging
              behavior, diet, and nestling provisinioning rates to determine if
              landscape-scale variation in arthropod (food) abundance affects higher trophic
              levels.
