Abstract    :
              Physics (13) This project is significantly changing the way the algebra-based
              college physics course is taught. Comparatively little work has been done on
              revising this course. The new pedagogy being developed incorporates web-based
              lectures and computer-guided cooperative-learning problems labs. The new
              pedagogy allows students to access the lecture material at their convenience on
              the world-wide web, and makes the problems labs student-driven and as
              instructor-independent as possible. This "proof-of-concept" project
              concentrates on the first semester of the college physics sequence, and
              includes completing the web-based lectures, EXCEL spreadsheets, and the
              activity book; completing a preliminary assessment of the first semester course
              at Middle Tennessee State University using a pre-existing assessment instrument
              (the Force Concept Inventory) and student/instructor evaluations; and
              identifying potential test sites, evaluation teams and a publisher for the
              completed sequence materials. It is expected that this project will result in a
              future full development project for the revision and evaluation of the pedagogy
              for the complete introductory college physics sequence.
