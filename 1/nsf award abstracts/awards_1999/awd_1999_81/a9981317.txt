Antoy
This award supports Sergio Antoy and Assistant Professor Barton
              Massey in a collaboration with Michael Hanus of the department of Computer
              Sciences at the Rhein-Westfalia Technical University in Aachen, Germany.  The
              project will investigate the advantages and difficulties of introducing
              non-deterministic functions into a new type of computer language known as a
              functional logic language.  The U.S. and German groups, both with recognized
              expertise in this area, have been working in parallel on different aspects of
              the same problem and will now have the opportunity to combine their efforts. 
              They expect to develop a new compiler for the language that will be robust
              enough for use in industry.  They also intend to develop a set of didactic
              examples of functional logic programming that will be used in graduate courses
              in this new area.  Both groups have produced results in the past that are
              widely recognized to be of fundamental importance in functional logic
              programming languages.  There remain many interesting problems to be explored
              in this area of research, and this collaboration will produce new solutions to
              some of them.
