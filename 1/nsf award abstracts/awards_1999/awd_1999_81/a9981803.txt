This project is a theoretical study of the role of
              inbreeding depression in the evolution of gender in higher plants, and has two
              major goals: (1) the development of a general, empirically testable theory of
              inbreeding depression in plant populations, and (2) the application of this
              theory to the problem of the role of inbreeding in the evolutionary pathway
              from hermaphroditism to separate sexes.  Methods used include numerical
              combinatorial analysis, parallel programming, and stochastic individual-based
              modeling.

These investigations will illuminate our understanding of genetic
              mechanisms involved in four major areas of active research in evolutionary
              mechanisms in higher plants: evolution of separate sexes from hermaphroditism,
              evolution of inbreeding depression in mixed-mating species, evolutionary
              genetics and viability of small populations, and evolution of the outcrossing
              rate generally. The results are also pertinent to the theory and methods of
              purging genetic load from agricultural species through controlled breeding, the
              production of genetically viable male-sterile lines, and the genetic management
              of endangered plant populations.
