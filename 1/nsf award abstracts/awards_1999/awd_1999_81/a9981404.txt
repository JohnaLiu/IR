This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              materials engineering  involves Claude Cohen and a graduate student from
              Cornell University and Arnaud Poitou and Mohend Chaouche of the Ecole Normale
              Superieure de Cachan, France. The project, supported under a joint program of
              the National Science Foundation, and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS), will facilitate collaboration on the development of
              constitutive models for the behavior of well-defined and characterized
              elastomers under biaxial deformation conditions.  Elastomers are rubber-like
              synthetic polymers.  The investigators will synthesize fiber-reinforced,
              well-defined elastomers and study the role of adhesive contact between fibers. 
               Because fiber contact, orientation and distribution govern electrical
              conductivity, their study is important to the development of a predictive
              model.  

The project takes advantage of U.S. and French complementary
              expertise and access to a unique multiaxial French instrument, known as ASTREE.
               The instrument will enable the researchers to process the materials under an
              electrical field and permit them to discriminate among existing models whose
              predictions are similar under uniaxial flows.  The proposal will also advance
              understanding of the properties, processing of elastomers and their potential
              uses in the automotive industry. The award will support the incremental costs
              of the international collaboration; that is, the travel to Paris, France and
              subsistence expenses of the U.S. investigators.  The CNRS will support visits
              to the U.S. by the French investigators.
