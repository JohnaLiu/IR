This award supports Jeff Squier, Kent Wilson, and four
              post-doctoral students at the University of California, San Diego in a
              collaboration with Dietrich von der Linde of the Department of Laser and Plasma
              Physics at the University of Essen, Germany.  The collaboration will use
              ultra-fast x-ray lasers (only recently available) to develop new techniques for
              time resolved x-ray diffraction.  This will be accomplished through the use of
              those techniques to time-resolve collective lattice excitations in solids. 
              Such studies will increase our understanding of extreme states of matter, as
              well as provide enabling technologies for directly studying chemical reaction
              on the atomic scale.  This project combines the German expertise in ultra-fast
              solid-state physics with the U.S. expertise in ultra-fast optics and
              chemistry.
