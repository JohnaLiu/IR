Abstract    :
              Physics (13) The primary goal of the Student- Centered Activities for Large
              Enrollment University Physics (SCALE-UP) Project is to determine the best way
              to establish a highly collaborative, hands-on, computer-rich, interactive
              learning environment in large-enrollment physics courses. We know from
              extensive educational research that students should collaborate on interesting
              tasks and be actively involved with the material they are learning. The Physics
              Department at North Carolina State University has had considerable success with
              small and intermediate-sized classes taught this way and is now searching for
              the best way to 'scale-up' the innovations so that students taking the large
              enrollment engineering physics courses can benefit. The project is folding
              together lecture and lab with multiple instructors in a way that should provide
              an economical alternative to traditional lecture-oriented instruction. The
              project involves the development, evaluation, and dissemination of new
              curricular materials that will support this type of learning. The SCALE-UP
              Project has the potential to radically change the way physics is taught at
              large colleges and universities. The pedagogical techniques should be general
              enough to encourage similar reforms in other science, engineering, and
              mathematics classes.
