Abstract    :
              This project will examine how Dominicans (Caribbean) are responding to new free
              trade rulings by the World Trade Organization that eliminate protected markets
              for their major agricultural export, bananas. The author argues that these
              rulings will make it difficult for small producers to compete with large
              operations based in Central/South America, and that they seek to develop
              alternative markets (different products and trade routes). The focus will be on
              women market entrepreneurs ("hucksters") who have historically played a major
              role in mediating trade relationships and generating alternative markets for
              produce. The project will be based in Roseau, headquarters of the Dominica
              Hucksters Association. Theoretically, it will examine how local communities
              respond to economic globalization (and liberalization), specifically trade
              legislation that alters previous post-colonial dependency relationships.
