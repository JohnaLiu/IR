Collaborative Education and
              Research Initiative:  CERI

This CISE Collaborative Education and Research
              Initiative (CERI) project provides support for the Department of Computer
              Science at Bowie State University (BSU) to enhance its research and education
              programs at the undergraduate levels through collaboration with the University
              of Maryland Institute of Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) and the Computer
              Science Department (CSD) at the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP). 
              This project will enable the Department of Computer Science at BSU to transform
              itself from primarily a teaching department to a department in which research
              is integrated with teaching to enhance learning.  The vision of the Computer
              Science program at BSU is to become nationally known as a leading producer of
              minority Computer Science professionals.  The goal of this project is to
              establish a self-sustaining partnership with UMIACS and CSD in order to enhance
              Computer Science research and education at BSU, especially in the areas of
              database management systems, agent-based computing, real-time computing
              systems, image processing, and multimedia applications.  Collaboration with
              UMIACS and CSD will enable BSU to take advantage of the research facilities at
              UMCP and expertise of its faculty.
