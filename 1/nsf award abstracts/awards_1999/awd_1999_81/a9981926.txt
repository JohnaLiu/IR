Mathematical models of species competing in
              space and time will be
studied using a combination of analytical, simulation,
              and numerical
methods. Three specific sorts of natural community will form
              foci of
this work: annual plants with persistence seed banks (especially
              those
found in arid environments), perennial herbs that spread spatially
              by
vegetative means, and long-lived perennial organisms that do not
              have
vegetative spread but have multiple reproductive events in the life
              of
an individual (iteroparity).  The research will examine how
              life-history
traits, such as those defining these different communities,
              interact
with environmental variation in space and time and affect coexistence
              of
species and therefore affect maintenance of species diversity. In
addition
              to the features distinguishing the above systems, important
factors are
              expected to be mode of dispersal of offspring, distance of
dispersal, and
              spatial and temporal scales of competition between
individual organisms.  This
              work will extend to the spatial domain
previous findings on the role of
              temporal environmental variation and
its interactions with life-history traits
              on the maintenance of species
diversity.
