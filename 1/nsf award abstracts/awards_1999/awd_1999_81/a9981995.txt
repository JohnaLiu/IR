Abstract    :
              With the advent of extremely small, low power devices and wireless
              communications technologies, we are experiencing an explosion in the number of
              extremely small, mobile, portable devices.  This award supports expenses of
              researchers to participate in a joint NSF/DARPA/NIST workshop on research
              direction in smart environments which maximize the benefit of such distributed
              and ubiquitous computing capabilities.  The workshop will be held in the
              special purpose smart environment of Classroom 2000 at Georgia Tech. The
              results of the workshop will be an extended report on research directions
              intersecting areas of HCI, distributed computing, embedded software
              development, and networking.
