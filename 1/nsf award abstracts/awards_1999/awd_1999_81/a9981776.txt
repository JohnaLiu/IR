Abstract    :
              9981776  Cooper  This is an award to provide support for preliminary research to
              evaluate the possible use of enzymatic oxidation for inactivation of
              microorganisms that are resistant to inactivation by us of processes in current
              use in environmental engineering practice.  This preliminary work will be aimed
              at testing the hypothesis that a peroxidase enzyme and an oxidizing agent in
              combination with an appropriate non-halogenic substrate can function as a
              disinfection process for domestic wastewater.  Objectives of the planning grant
              phase will include identification of appropriate substrates, evaluation of the
              feasibility of the concept and comparison with potential alternatives.  The
              proposal leading to this award was submitted in accord with Program
              Announcement NSF 94-147, Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards
              for Minority Scientists and Engineers.  The proposed research is exploratory in
              nature.  It addresses the potential use of a concept for disinfection that
              would complement processes now used in environmental engineering practice and
              is likely to provide this investigator with the basis for a proposal to obtain
              sufficient additional knowledge for use in engineering design of disinfection
              processes and systems.  ***
