Abstract    :
              This project investigates the links between hail formation, storm
              electrification, and lightning in severe storms.  It includes the analysis of
              cloud electrical and microphysical data collected by the storm-penetrating T-28
              aircraft and modeling the production of charge and precipitation with a
              three-dimensional numerical cloud model.  The observations and modeling results
              will be shared with other investigators on the STEPS program (Severe
              Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study) conducted in Kansas in
              the early summer of 2000.  The other investigators will provide observations
              that include polarimetric radar measurements to identify precipitation type,
              dual-Doppler radar measurements to define the kinematic structure of
              thunderstorms, balloon-borne electrical field measurements, and
              three-dimensional maps of lightning strokes measured by a VHF lightning mapper.
               A synthesis of the electrical, microphysical, and storm-structure data
              supplied by STEPS will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of
              lightning formation in thunderstorms and the relations between electrical
              properties of storms and the precipitation they produce.
