Abstract    :
              Astronomy (11) This project is adapting web-based learning materials developed
              at the University of Colorado and elsewhere to re-design an inquiry-based,
              two-semester introductory astronomy sequence for approximately 1,100
              undergraduates each semester. Many students who take this course are not
              effectively engaged by the current lecture format. Lectures are replaced with
              peer instruction, interactive learning environments, and asynchronous learning
              opportunities enabled by the WWW. In addition to the usual goals of such a
              course, the goals of the two-year project are to: (1) familiarize students with
              the use of computers for elementary analysis and for exploration on the
              world-wide web; (2) facilitate active and cooperative learning through computer
              technology; (3) realize opportunities to reduce costs of delivery of such
              courses through technology; (4) contribute to the development of a national
              resource for teaching elementary astronomy. The project is also offering
              courses aimed at training prospective and in-service teachers in the use of
              web-based technology for K-12 science education.

The project's success in
              achieving these goals is being measured through comparison with sections taught
              in traditional formats. Description of the project and dissemination if results
              is being done through a web site, presentations at national meetings, and
              publications in appropriate journals.
