Abstract    :
              This project will reconstruct the phylogeny of carabid beetles (Coleoptera:
              Carabidae), one of the dominant groups of small predators.  The focus will be
              on relationships of the tribes of this large family, with a concentration on
              the relationships within the largest subfamily, the Harpalinae, a group which
              has radiated into over 25,000 species since the Cretaceous.  Within the
              Harpalinae, the basal pterostichite lineages will be examined in detail, as
              will the abundant lebiomorphs, which have ascended vegetation and radiated into
              the rainforest canopy.  A matrix of morphological characters from both adults
              and larvae of over 200 taxa will be constructed that draws on plentiful
              published accounts, newly sampled taxa and novel character systems.  Molecular
              sequence data for 28S rDNA and the wingless gene will be gathered for these
              same taxa, expanding existing information about these genes by adding taxa
              critical to understanding carabid evolution in general and harpaline radiation
              in particular.  The project will yield not only knowledge of the evolutionary
              history of carabids, but a classification of the family based for the first
              time on an explicit, and comprehensive, phylogenetic analysis.
