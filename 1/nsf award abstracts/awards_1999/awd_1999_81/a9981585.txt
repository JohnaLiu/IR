This award supports Christopher Lynch and three students from
              Georgia Tech in a collaboration with Juergen Roedel of the Department of
              Mechanical Engineering at the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany.  The
              project will focus on understanding the mechanisms of failure of ferroelectric
              ceramics under both electrical and mechanical loading.  Recent applications of
              ferroelectric ceramics, such as light-weight, quick-response acoustic-and
              vibration-control devices require that the materials be able to withstand large
              strains, making reliability of such materials one of the top engineering
              fields.  The U.S. group has developed a finite-element code capable of modeling
              stress and electric field concentration in ferroelectric materials; the German
              group has developed experimental techniques and specialized equipment for
              measuring the crack propagation behavior of the materials under investigation. 
              The collaboration will bring together the complementary strengths of both
              groups, which should lead to new capabilities for the design of optimal
              ceramics.
