Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

The statistics computer laboratory is being
              established to enable the incorporation of real data and data analysis into
              undergraduate statistics courses.  The integration of technology and changes in
              the pedagogical approaches possible with the laboratory are expected to
              increase student appreciation of statistics and foster an understanding of data
              analysis.  An upper level course involving simulations with re-sampling
              techniques to teach data analysis and a lower level course on basic statistical
              methods for pre-majors in economics, social sciences, and life sciences are
              among the courses being modified.  Several texts and software packages are
              being adapted and implemented in the course.  Materials are also being
              developed to further enable innovative and effective teaching.
