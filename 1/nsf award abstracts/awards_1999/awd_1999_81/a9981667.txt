This project will
              enhance the understanding of the diversity and evolution of the Amblyoponini, a
              putative primitive lineage, and potentially a sister group of all other extant
              ants.  Analysis of this group is critical to efforts to understand the origin
              and evolution of ants and their social behavior, an understanding seriously
              impeded by a lack of robust knowledge  about themost primitive groups.  In this
              project, the investigators will complete a species-level taxonomic revision
              based on comparative morphological studies of world Amblyoponini.  As part of
              this process, morphological and molecular data will be compated to infer the
              phylogenetic relationships among major ant clades.  The resulting phylogeny
              will be used to trace the evolution of important traits that are involved in
              colony founding, foraging behavior, communication and social structure.  In
              addition, these phylogenies will be used to investigat eht historical
              biogeongraphy of these ants with respect to their prolific radiation in
              Madagascar.
