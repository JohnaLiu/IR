Abstract    :
              Robert Compton of the University of Tennessee is supported by a grant from the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform experiments to study the
              production of dianions and their destruction by photodetachment. The studies
              will include both large carbon containing molecules and smaller fluorinated
              metals.  The dianions will be generated in a variety of ways including laser
              desorption, fast anion collisions with electron donating gases, gas phase
              electron attachment, electrospray and burning metal wires in fluorine.  In the
              laser desorption, the enhancement of dianion production by magnetic fields will
              be investigated. During these studies, fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic
              data will be obtained such as cross-sections for collisional electron
              attachment, electron affinities, bond dissociation energies and thresholds for
              attachment.  These data will be used to investigate the interaction potential
              between the electron and the monoanion and to probe the Coulomb barrier
              involved.

The proposed studies will lead to a greater understanding of the
              interaction of electrons with molecules having a single negative charge.  The
              doubly charged molecules so produced are important in emerging fields of mass
              spectrometry and have applications in biology, medicine, as well as the
              technological areas of radiation chemistry, photochemistry, plasma physics and
              in high voltage accelerators such as the National Spallation Neutron Source.
