During pollination, more pollen grains typically arrive at
              flowers than are necessary to fertilize all of the seeds. This provides an
              opportunity for differential success of pollen from different plants. Although
              this process might affect the success of plants during mating and thus select
              for particular characteristics, it has been difficult to resolve whether it is
              important in natural populations. By studying both differential seed siring
              ability and differential offspring performance of pollen donors in experiments
              that vary both the size and composition of pollen loads on wild radish,
              Marshall and her students will directly address this problem.

Generally
              speaking, understanding of the factors that control plant mating success is
              important because these factors control whether inbreeding occurs, whether some
              plants are more successful than others, and whether speciation occurs. The
              specific case of differential success among pollen donors is important because
              this has been suggested as a tool for faster breeding of desirable traits into
              crop species.  Addressing whether success during mating is always correlated
              with success during growth is essential to predicting the utility of this
              method of plant breeding. This experiment also has educational benefits as
              Marshall will continue to involve significant numbers of undergraduate and
              graduate students in the research. A high proportion of these students have
              been women and minorities.
