Abstract    :
              Scientists and engineers are currently unable to assess underwater landslide and
              slump risk, or to predict their occurrence following a nearby earthquake, or to
              evaluate their tsunamigenic potential, or be able to warn coastal communities
              of imminent danger.

Underwater landslides and slumps pose a continuous
              threat to US coastal economic activity, including valuable offshore structures
              and port facilities.  Some of the largest and most deadly tsunamis this decade
              (e.g. Papua New Guinea, Flores Island, Nicaragua) involved wave generation by
              nearshore underwater landslides or slumps.  These events generated tsunami
              runup reaching 100 feet above sea level, far surpassing most previous
              predictions of maximum tsunami amplitude for such moderate earthquakes.

This
              action is to support an interdisciplinary approach to underwater landslide and
              slump hazard assessment, with the goal of contributing to the development of
              deterministic or probabilistic predictions of failure size and location. 
              Specifically, it is to support (1) a workshop to present the state-of-the-art
              in all pertinent disciplines, (2) evaluate existing predictive models, (3)
              compare databases and case studies, (4) focus future research activities, (5)
              write recommendations for public agencies, and (6) discuss the creation of a
              research center to further predictions of underwater landslide and slump, and
              to apply these to the development of reliable tsunami warnings involving US
              coastal waters.
