Three fundamental questions for evolutionary biologists are: 1)
              How rapidly does evolution occur? 2) Is the pattern of change repeatable? 3)
              Are most changes historically contingent, or do the deterministic forces of
              natural selection dominate? The introduction of the European fruit fly,
              Drosophila subobscura, into North and South America in the late 1970's provides
              a unique opportunity to address these questions. Many traits, including genetic
              markers and body size, vary systematically with latitude among the ancestral
              European populations. Previous studies show that the North American flies have
              evolved similar latitudinal patterns in less than 20 years. The studies funded
              by this award will investigate the South American populations and provide
              further information on the North American and European populations. This is a
              unique opportunity to observe evolutionary change as it occurs over a broad
              geographic range. 

Species introductions are currently reshaping much of
              Earth's biological diversity. Many studies assess the impact of introduced
              species on native populations. Evolutionary changes in the introduced species,
              however, have generally been neglected even though such changes ultimately
              determine the ecological impact of the invasion. Furthermore, these natural
              experiments demonstrate the evolutionary and ecological response of populations
              to novel habitats, which will help predict the impact of climate change on the
              distribution and abundance of agricultural pests and insect-borne diseases.
