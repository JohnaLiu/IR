	Arthropods have played a central role in recent
              studies of development and evolution, particularly, for identifying mechanisms
              conserved across animals. Arthropods should be equally valuable for studies of
              diversification, given their wide range of morphologies and physiologies, their
              species richness, and a fossil record that extends to the Cambrian. However,
              studies of diversity (from gene to morphology) across Arthropoda are hindered
              by the absence of clearly identifiable, monophyletic groups. As a result, many
              fundamental aspects of arthropod evolutionary history remain uncertain. For
              example, do suites of
morphological characters found across subphyla and which
              are associated
with terrestrialization, such as features of respiration and
              locomotion, represent convergences or shared, derived features? A robust
              resolution of arthropod relationships would represent a major advance for
              historical biology and would provide a means of testing these and many other
              evolutionary hypotheses.

	Recent molecular studies, including our own
              NSF-supported study,
provide compelling evidence that Crustacea and Hexapoda
              (called Pancrustacea) are closely related, contra the traditional hypothesis
              that the terrestrial groups Hexapoda and Myriapoda are more closely related. 
              Together with our strong support for the monophyly of Chelicerata (including
              Pycnogonida) and Myriapoda, we now propose to resolve the basal arthropod
              trichotomy among Pancrustacea, Chelicerata, and Myriapoda.  Additionally, we
              propose to resolve basal relationships within Pancrustacea, particularly the
              placement of Hexapoda with respect to the crustacean classes; current molecular
              (and morphological) evidence is not compelling for a monophyletic
              Crustacea.

	Our current and proposed phylogenetic studies utilize
              nucleotides
and inferred amino acids from multiple protein-encoding, nuclear
              gene
sequences, including elongation factor-1a (1092 nt), RNA polymerase
              II
(largest subunit, 1038 nt to ~1600 nt), and elongation factor-2 (1899
              nt).
Fifty-four species of arthropods and their near-outgroups (i.e.,
              Onychophora and Tardigrada) will be sampled, including 8 hexapods, 23
              crustaceans, 6 chelicerates, 5 myriapods, 9 tardigrades, and 3 onychophorans. 
              Published morphological character matrices will be reanalyzed in light of our
              strongly supported molecular results.
