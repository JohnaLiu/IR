This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              subatomic physics involves Chaden Djalali, David Tedeschi, and graduate
              students at the University of South Carolina and Michel Guidal and his research
              group at the Institute of Nuclear Physics, University of Paris in Orsay.  The
              U.S. and French teams will conduct experiments using the CEBAF Large Acceptance
              Spectrometer at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility for
              investigations of electro and photoproduction of vector mesons.  Experiments on
              the effect of nuclear density on relativistic heavy ion collisions and on
              vector meson electroproduction reaction on the nucleon are scheduled over the
              next three years.  The teams will meet regularly to design the experiments,
              perform data analysis, and discuss theoretical issues. 

The award represents
              the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for
              Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses
              for the U.S. investigators and graduate students and the CNRS will support the
              visits of the French researchers to the United States.  The project combines
              experimental expertise of the U.S. researchers with the theoretical knowledge
              of the French team and will advance understanding of the role of vector mesons
              in nuclear reactions and into the structure of the nucleon and nuclei.
