This award supports Marshall Luban, Paul Canfield, Alan Goldman,
              Constantine Stassis, and a graduate student from Iowa State University in a
              collaboration with Klaus Baerwinkel of the Department of Physics at the
              University of Osnabruek, Germany.  The project will focus on the rapidly
              evolving and inter-disciplinary field of mesoscopic magnetism, which combines
              aspects of chemistry and physics.  The main goal of the new field is the
              understanding of the evolution of magnetic systems that contain on the order of
              tens of interacting magnetic ions.  The U.S. and German groups contribute
              expertise in organic and inorganic chemistry, molecular and condensed matter
              physics, as well as the necessary mix of theoretical and experimental expertise
              necessary for the synthesis, characterization, and theoretical analysis of new
              material systems.  The scientists involved in the collaboration are experts in
              their fields, the facilities available are state-of-the-art, and the projected
              result is an understanding of the fundamental question of when clusters of
              magnetic spins begin to exhibit new behaviors as a function of cluster size.
