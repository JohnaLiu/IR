This research continues a study of food webs,
              relations that specify which species eat which in an ecological community.  We
              simulate invasion of a large predator onto islands having a variety of small
              predators as well as herbivores and plants.  Such predators may not only exert
              profound direct effects by consumption, but via intervening species, can
              indirectly affect other components, including plants.  Such indirect effects
              may be positive or negative: e.g., the large predator may consume insects that
              eat plants (positive), or consume small predators that eat the plant-eating
              insects (negative).  In addition to changes in numbers, changes in behavior and
              morphology of affected species are studied.  The experiment is performed within
              a system of islands, many of which have been monitored for natural invasions
              and extinctions for nearly two decades.  Planned monitoring includes extensive
              documentation of damage and recovery from the recent Hurricane Floyd, a
              devastating, Category 4 storm.  Results of this project should significantly
              enhance our understanding of how large natural disturbances affect the dynamics
              of ecological systems.
