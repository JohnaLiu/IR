The objectives of the Design Class are to provide the
              students with a real-world experience in engineering design, to stimulate their
              interest in working with the disabled, and to build a custom device that helps
              disabled individuals become more independent. Project ideas are proposed by
              therapists who work with the disabled and have needs that are not met by
              commercially available devices. The therapists are to serve as advisors during
              the semester, and students can consult with them to insure the device will meet
              their needs. Students will spend the semester designing and building the
              device, and at the end of the semester, the students are to give the device to
              the disabled individual(s) and their therapists. The class is to be supported
              with lectures by the instructor and guests, as well as field trips, writing
              assignments, and oral presentations.   

The Principal Investigator is to
              provide an annual report that includes a description of the projects
              successfully completed during the previous academic year. The report will be
              combined with similar accounts from other NSF-supported Design Projects and
              published in a book for general distribution.
