Abstract    :
              Engineering - Materials Science (57)
This project addresses the national need
              to educate plastics engineering technicians in the art and science of blow
              molding. Specifically, it addresses the expansion and dissemination of plastics
              curriculum at Pennsylvania College of Technology (Penn College) to include
              hands-on experiences in extrusion and injection stretch-blow molding technology
              with accompanying commercially viable laboratory educational materials.
              Curriculum development includes a focused, sophomore level blow molding course
              and inclusion of blow molding education within other survey and advanced
              courses. Laboratory experience is building on an existing extrusion blow molder
              by purchase and installation of a state-of-the-art polyethylene terephthalate
              (PET) stretch-blow molder, and fabrication of a vital piece of testing
              equipment--a polarized light table to measure product quality. Outcomes
              include: 1) establishment of a unique, nationally-relevant facility
              representing an academically based, commercial stretch-blow-molding curriculum;
              2) enhancement of Penn College's plastics curriculum to offer students broader
              plastics education, making them more competitive in the marketplace and better
              able to adapt to a changing world of manufacturing technology; 3) introductory
              and advanced educational and professional development opportunities for
              secondary students and teachers, post-secondary faculty, and plastics
              technicians.
