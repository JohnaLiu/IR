Scaling soil C and N storage in a changing savanna
              parkland landscape

Woody plant encroachment into grasslands and savannas has
              been widely reported in recent history. This phenomenon may alter the storage
              and dynamics of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in plants and soils, with possible
              implications for the global climate system. This study will examine how the
              spatial structure of soil organic C, N, and root mass changes with a shift from
              grass to woody plant domination. Novel geostatistical approaches will be
              utilized to extrapolate point measurements across large areas. The results will
              improve understanding of the spatial patterns of soil properties, and
              scientists' ability to estimate landscape-scale C and N from point samples and
              easily measured aboveground vegetation structures. The latter is critical to
              constraining and evaluating ecosystem simulation models being parameterized for
              large-scale applications, and estimating the magnitude of C and N accumulation
              that has accompanied woody plant encroachment into grasslands over the past
              century.
