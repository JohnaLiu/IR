This project will study why high rates of genetic
              mutation arise
and persist in bacterial populations. The PI has previously
              documented the
origin and persistence of high mutation rates caused by mutator
              genes in
populations of Escherichia coli  that have been propagated in
              the
laboratory. The three goals of the current project are: 1) to
              understand
why mutator genes are successful; 2) to study the dynamics of
              mutator genes
in populations; and 3) to document the DNA sequence changes that
              give rise
to mutator genes in these populations. Goals 1 and 2 will be
              achieved
through laboratory experiments in which E. coli cells bearing mutator
              genes
are competed against their normal counterparts. Goal 3 will be achieved
              by
DNA sequencing of mutator genes.
 
Because mutation is the ultimate
              source of genetic variation,
elucidating how mutation rates are established
              and maintained is of
fundamental importance to our understanding of genetics
              and evolution. But
substantial societal implications exist as well: Mutator
              genes have been
associated with pathogenicity in bacteria and with cancer in
              humans. The PI
has shown that these mutator genes and the mutators in his
              study system
arise from defects in the same general genetic pathway, and
              further
research has suggested that similar population-level processes are
              likely
to be involved in the laboratory and in nature. This project is
              therefore
likely to contribute significant insights in these areas of
              societal
importance.
