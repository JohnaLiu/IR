Abstract    :
              Martin Head-Gordon of the U. California-Berkeley is supported by the Theoretical
              and Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply techniques for
              large-scale quantum chemistry calculations.  He will formulate
              self-consistent-field theory in terms of independent variables in nonorthogonal
              basis sets, to facilitate the development of new linear scaling methods.  He
              will also develop self-consistent-field methods using polarized atomic
              orbitals, for improved electron correlation treatments and simpler physical
              interpretations.  He will incorporate improvements into fast Coulomb
              interaction calculational methods.  He will examine the interaction of carbon
              monoxide on metal surfaces with applied fields and voltages.

New theoretical
              methods are needed to perform accurate calculations on the structures and
              energetics of ever larger molecules and clusters of interest to materials and
              biological applications.  The techniques under development here will address
              bottlenecks currently preventing such large-scale calculations.  The
              metal-molecule applications represent studies where not only is there a clear
              need for new theoretical insight, but also where the methods under development
              offer advantages that can be exploited.
