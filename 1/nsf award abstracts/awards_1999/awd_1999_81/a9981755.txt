This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              in computation and computer research involves Dana Randall, Vijay Vazirani,
              Leonard Schulman and other researchers from the College of Computing at Georgia
              Institute of Technology, and Claire Kenyon and the research group at LRI
              (Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique), University of Paris, Sud.  The
              project is supported under a joint program of the National Science Foundation
              and the French National Center for Scientific Research.  The project focuses on
              four areas of research in theoretical computer science, emphasizing
              applications for approximation algorithms and new models of computation.  The
              areas are:  (1) Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for analysis of physical
              systems; (2) approximation algorithms; (3) codes and loss-resilience in the
              context of constructing codes for loss information retrieval; and (3) quantum
              computation, in particular, quantum cryptography.

This award will support
              the incremental costs of the international collaboration; that is, the travel
              to Paris, France and subsistence expenses of the U.S. investigators.  The
              project takes advantage of complementary expertise of the U.S. and French
              groups and their work on similar problems.  The project will advance
              fundamental understanding of randomness and approximation problems in computing
              that are connected to other fields of science, namely, statistical mechanics,
              data mining, coding theory, and quantum mechanics.
