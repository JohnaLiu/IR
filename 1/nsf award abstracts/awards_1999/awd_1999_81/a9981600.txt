Linking DOC and DON Fluxes to Soil Properties
              at Watershed and Landscape Scales

Dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC
              and DON) are compounds derived from decomposing leaves and soil that impart
              taste, odor, and color to water.  These compounds can affect water quality,
              increasing the solubility of metals and pesticides, and causing the formation
              of trihalomethanes (e.g. chloroform) when drinking water supplies are
              chlorinated. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen in the soil profile (soil C/N)
              reflects the climate, vegetation, topography and geology of a site. Recent work
              by the PI shows that soil C/N is an accurate predictor of the amount of DOC
              leaving terrestrial ecosystems in streams and rivers around the world. This
              relationship will be tested within a single biome, wet tropical forest in
              Puerto Rico.  If the relationship also applies within a biome, then soil C/N
              may provide a tool for predicting changes in surface water quality that could
              occur with changes in climate. Such a predictive tool does not exist at
              present.
