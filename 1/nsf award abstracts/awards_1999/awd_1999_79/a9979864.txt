Abstract    :
              This research project tests the hypothesis that diversifying the genres of text
              used in early literacy instruction, focussing in particular on informational
              text,  will aid children in using such texts in later grades and result in
              better learning of information based subjects such as science.  The project
              consists of a longitudinal, experimental study. Low Social Economic Status
              (SES) students in 30 classes are followed for a two-year period from first
              through second grade. At random, 10 classes are involved in an intervention
              designed to diversify the genres of text used in their literacy instruction.
              Another 10 classes are  involved in an intervention that similarly increases
              overall experience with text, but does not diversify the genres of texts used,
              thus providing a targeted comparison group. The final 10 classes  comprise a
              traditional control group. Students' performances on norm-referenced tests of
              reading achievement, reading inventories, and prompted writing samples will be
              compared for the three groups using growth modeling methods and inferential
              statistics.
