Abstract    :
              This NSF GK-12 Fellow Project involves a collaboration of 17 grade 4-6 teachers,
              17 NSF graduate and undergraduate content and technology resource fellows, and
              Ohio State University (OSU) science, engineering, pharmacy and math professors.
              The collaboration is adapting and implementing scientific and math
              investigations in grade 4-6 classrooms of the 64,000 student urban school
              district in Columbus, OH. The inquiry investigations support the curriculum of
              the schools and the inquiry strategies in the National Standards, the Ohio
              Model Competency-Based Science Program, and the Benchmarks in Science
              Literacy.
The project involves several key components: a) Four-person
              teacher-fellow teams each adapt 12 hours of inquiry investigations for use in
              special parts of the local curriculum. b) Before their use with students, other
              teachers and fellows participate as students in using the investigations during
              weekly 3-hour teacher-fellow classes. The teachers and fellows provide feedback
              that is used to modify the investigations.  c) After revision, all of the
              teachers assisted by fellows use the inquiry investigations in their grade 4-6
              classrooms.  Each year, the focus is on one particular grade level, with
              follow-up visits to classes involved during previous years. In addition, the
              teacher-fellow teams produce kits that can be used by teachers in classes
              throughout Ohio. The dissemination of these kits is facilitated through summer
              workshops led by fellow-teacher teams for other Columbus grade 4-6 teachers and
              for OSU Extension Agents who offer workshops for teachers throughout Ohio.
