This US-Mexico project will support Prof. Harold Spector of
              Illinois Institute of Technology in a research collaboration with Prof. Marcelo
              del Castillo-Mussot of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).  The
              researchers intend to investigate the properties of semiconducting
              nanostructures such as quantum wells, quantum wires, and quantum dots. 
              

More specifically, they will investigate both the energies and
              wavefunctions of electrons and excitons in highly confined systems.  Among the
              systems they plan to study are screened excitons in quantum wells and
              electronic states associated with hydrogenic impurities in quantum dots.  These
              systems are vitally important in the preparation of semiconductor multilayers,
              the resulting structures being responsible for new generations of electronic
              and optoelectronic devices offering superior performance.  For this project the
              US side will concentrate on the analytical calculations while the Mexican side
              will contribute extensive numerical and computational resources.
