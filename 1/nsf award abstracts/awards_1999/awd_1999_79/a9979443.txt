Emerging broadband wireless networks for multimedia
              information dissemination demand increasingly higher and variable rates.  The
              integration of wireline-wireless networks, the size and low-power limitations
              in portable units, user mobility, and channel propagation effects pose major
              challenges to wideband communications.  Code division and multicarrier systems
              offer two multiple access schemes with great potential to cope with these
              challenges, provided that their complementary advantages and performance
              limitations, in the presence of multipath propagation and multiuser
              interference, are addressed.

The PI's propose to develop and analyze an
              optimal generalized multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) system
              for broadband wireless mobile communications.  Specifically, they take a global
              system view that incorporates adaptive, scalable and robust joint
              source/channel coding and multiple access techniques subject to power
              consumption and networking constraints.  Their flexible generalized MC-CDMA
              precoder designs guarantee perfect interference elimination with simple linear
              receivers and are robust to channel fading effects.

Basic research,
              algorithms, and analytical performance evaluations are complemented by
              experimental validation with a millimeter-wave software radio testbed.  The
              experimental facility will also foster enhanced student training and
              multidisciplinary research and development with committed collaborators at the
              University of Minnesota and the local industry.
