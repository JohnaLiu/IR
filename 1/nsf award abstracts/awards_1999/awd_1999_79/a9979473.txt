Abstract    :
              Significant change has occurred in reindeer herding in the Seward Peninsula,
              Alaska, due to the migration of large numbers of the Western Arctic Herd
              caribou onto the Peninsula in winter.  This research would study the
              environmental and socio-economic conditions of this change.  The work would
              identify climate factors that influence herding practices and would evaluate
              the role of reindeer herding in the subsistence economy.  The research will
              examine the ecological impacts of caribou grazing on ecosystem sustainability. 
              Finally, it would model the socio-economic consequences of losses via migration
              out of the region and via range deterioration as well as changes in herd
              management in order to design strategies for herd management that would
              mitigate these impacts.  The work would involve local and educational
              communities.
