Abstract    :
              This research project explores the effectiveness of teacher education and
              learning in an inquiry-based learning program, Schools for Thought (SFT).  The
              project will produce three interrelated modules of materials  - each set
              containing case examples and exemplars, reflections on cases, and scoring
              guides anchored with examples of student work. CD-Rom and Web formats are used
              for the presentation of the material. In the first phase of the project,
              materials will be developed by experienced SFT teachers interacting with the
              PI. This will result in prototype teaching materials, scoring guides,
              curricula, and other supports for guiding less experienced SFT teachers in a
              process of inquiry into their own teaching. The teacher-cognitive scientist
              interactions will be examined to analyze differences in what teachers and
              cognitive scientists find most valuable when reflecting on learning programs
              based on cognitive principles.  The St. Louis public schools will provide a
              test bed for this inquiry-based curriculum.
