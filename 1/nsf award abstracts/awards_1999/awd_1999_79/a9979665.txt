This project combines expertise from the engineering fields of
              System Identification and Learning Control with the scientific fields of Atomic
              and Molecular Laser Spectroscopy applied to the problem of precise manipulation
              of quantum processes.  Algorithms developed for system identification using
              engineering concepts will be adapted and applied to the generation and control
              of complex quantum wavefunctions in simple atoms.  The goal is to manipulate a
              quantum process at a level of precision that may be thought to be impossible
              because exact knowledge of the process dynamics and the laboratory environment
              is normally lacking.  The project is jointly supported by the Division of
              Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Division
              of Electrical and Communications Systems in the Directorate for Engineering.
