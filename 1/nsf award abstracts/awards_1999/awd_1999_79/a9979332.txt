This is a planning visit award for Professor Frank L.
              Pezold, of the Department of Biological Sciences at Northeast Louisiana
              University, to travel to Mali to meet with Dr. Mamadou Diallo Iam, General
              Director of the National Centre for Scientific and Technological Research, as
              well as with representatives from other Malian research organizations and the
              US Agency for International Development.  The purpose of the visit is to
              finalize plans for a joint workshop on "Upper Niger River Corridor Ecology and
              Conservation."  

The Niger River is one of the largest rivers in the world,
              and it supports a variety of riparian and aquatic ecosystems, many of which are
              endemic to the region.  It also supplies the region with the majority its water
              for agriculture and human consumption.  Today, many of its biologically diverse
              ecosystems are being threatened by desertification from the Sahel, pollution,
              and the competing needs of wildlife and human populations.  The proposed
              workshop will establish conservation priorities for the Upper Niger River
              Corridor and identify areas of interest for multi-national collaborative
              research projects.
