This Americas Program award will support travel and related
              expenses for eight senior researchers and one junior faculty member, to
              participate in a joint US-Venezuela Workshop on High Performance Computing
              (HPC).  Organizers are Dr. Barton P. Miller, University of Wisconsin, Madison,
              and Dr. Carlos Figueira, Universidad Simon Bolivar, Caracas, Venezuela.  The
              topic area of this workshop, which explores the issues of delivering high
              levels of computing and data access, is a crucial one for coming decades, both
              technologically and economically. 

Workshop participants represent leaders
              in the areas of distributed supercomputing, high throughput computing,
              on-demand computing, data-intensive computing, and collaborative computing, all
              of which will be covered in the workshop.  The area of distributed
              (geographically dispersed) computing makes HPC especially well suited for
              international collaborations. The workshop will expand the domain of HPC
              problems and results available to the US researchers, and will lay the
              foundation for exchange and visits for faculty, graduate students and postdocs,
              from both countries.
