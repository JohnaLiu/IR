Abstract    :
              This project would develop measures for studying efforts to improve instruction.
               With increasing interest in instructional improvement, knowledge of how
              different interventions work will be important to those who seek to improve
              schools.  Useful knowledge of interventions must provide not only analyses of
              effects or descriptions of implementation, but expirations of the dynamics of
              enactment in the educational environments in which such interventions are made.
               Researchers are just beginning to develop, measures critical to building such
              knowledge.  This project would develop theoretical frameworks for the study of
              instructional improvement and instruments and analytic schemes based on those
              frameworks.
