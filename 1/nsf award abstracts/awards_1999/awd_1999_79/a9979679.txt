Abstract    :
              The Alaska Native Science Commission was created to bring together research and
              science in partnership with the Native community. It serves as a clearinghouse
              for proposed research, an information base for ongoing and past research, and
              an archive for significant research involving the Native community. The
              Commission provides information, referral, and networking services for
              researchers seeking active partners in the Native community. It operates as a
              bridge to bring these communities together.
