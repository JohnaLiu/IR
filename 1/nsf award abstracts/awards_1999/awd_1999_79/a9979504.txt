Abstract    :
              This project is using the systemic reform efforts already underway at two
              schools, under the NSF funded Texas Rural Systemic Initiative (TRSI), as a
              laboratory for introducing GK-12 fellows to issues of national consequence
              concerning how students are taught and learn high quality SMET K-12. The
              Beeville school district, located in South Texas, enrolls 4,305 students and
              employs 173 mathematics and science teachers K-12: 63% of students are
              economically disadvantaged and 68% are Hispanic. The Hereford school district,
              in the Texas Panhandle, enrolls 4,501 students and employs 176 mathematics and
              science teachers K-12: 61% of the students are economically disadvantaged and
              71% are Hispanic, of which over a quarter are from migrant agricultural
              families. Participants in the program are being immersed in the systemic reform
              efforts at these two schools. Rural schools are under-served in access to SMET
              resources and expertise, and often under-served by policy makers on issues of
              rural education; e.g., resources, geography (distance and isolation),
              demographics, poverty, and community.
