Abstract    :
              This research project concerns the investigation of  whether teacher training in
              triarchic (analytic, creative, practical) teaching results in improved student
              performance in grades 1-4. The study will involve rural, suburban, and urban
              schools drawing populations from low, medium, and high socioeconomic levels.
              For each of the 6 settings there will be 3 experimental and 6 control schools. 
              There will be at least 216 teachers involved in the study with an expectation
              that up to 324 teachers will participate. 

All conditions will cover the
              same basic skills. The duration of the intervention will be the same for each
              condition. The conditions will differ in the methods teachers are given for
              teaching skills. These are triarchic instruction (experimental), critical
              thinking or analytic instruction (control), and convention (memory based)
              instruction (control). The success of the intervention will be measured using
              multiple dependent variables including conventional evaluations by teachers and
              students, performance evaluations of teachers and students, and affective
              evaluations of teachers and students. It will be possible to compare gain
              scores in the experimental versus the control groups as will as in the two
              control groups compared to one another. The instructional intervention is in
              teacher training which will be for 40 hours (5 working days) and 10 hours of
              inservice instruction and monitoring of their implementation of learned
              materials.
