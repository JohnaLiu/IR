Abstract    :
              In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supported by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Dudley Herschbach of Harvard
              University will develop a generally applicable approach to produce very slow
              molecules for potential uses ranging from chemical reaction dynamics to
              applications in epitaxy or lithography.  A supersonic nozzle will be mounted on
              the periphery of a rotor that spins fast enough to cancel the flow velocity of
              the molecules emerging from the supersonic source.  The net velocity of the
              molecules will be quite low relative to the apparatus that will utilize them. 
              The device is purely mechanical, operates in a high vacuum, and is expected to
              produce a homogeneous stream of slow molecules that is uncontaminated by atoms
              or buffer gas.  A successful apparatus will provide a versatile instrument for
              use by both chemists and physicists. 

The high speed at which molecules move
              under ordinary conditions has been a major handicap in manipulating beams of
              molecules.  This new approach to producing a versatile source of slow molecules
              has the potential to markedly enhance techniques for controlled chemical
              applications of molecular beams.
