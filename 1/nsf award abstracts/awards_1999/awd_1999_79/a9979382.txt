This Pan American Advanced Institutes (PASI) award,
              jointly supported by NSF and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will convene a
              meeting of the leading experts in the area of classical-quantum correspondence
              to accomplish dual goals of high levels of information exchange within the
              framework of an advanced study institute.  The fields that have contributed
              most to the progress in the area of classical quantum correspondence include
              Atomic Physics and Quantum Optics.  Mesoscopic phenomena are also being probed
              with the atomic Bose Einstein condensates providing an exciting new testing
              ground.  On the other hand, chaotic dynamical evolution and entanglement are
              particularly acute manifestations of the quantum nature of the underlying
              microphysics.  The organizers feel that this interdisciplinary advanced
              institute can catalyze a unity of effort towards the understanding of these
              fundamental issues and can stimulate cooperation among researchers in the
              Americas.
