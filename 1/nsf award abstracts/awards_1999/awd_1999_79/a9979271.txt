Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
This project makes use of a multinuclear solid state nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer to enhance the undergraduate curriculum. 
              Relevant experiments from chemistry journals are being adapted for use in the
              curriculum.  Integration of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy in the inorganic
              chemistry laboratory exposes students to the properties of modern materials, as
              structural changes are demonstrated and synthesis is combined with modern
              spectroscopy as analytical tools.  Undergraduate research using optical
              sensitivity enhancement techniques in the study of surfaces is nourished by the
              use of a multinuclear NMR spectrometer.  The PI has extensive experience with
              NMR instrumentation and research.  The equipment is made available to other
              universities and colleges in the area.
