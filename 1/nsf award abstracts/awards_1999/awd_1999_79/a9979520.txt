Abstract    :
              This grant provides fellowships and training for 10 graduate and 10 advanced
              undergraduate science students per year for three years. These students are
              serving as resources in K-12 science education through a teaching
              apprenticeship program that utilizes the UAB/public school partnership
              infrastructure, the facilities of the new McWane Science Center, and seven
              highly successful K-12 science outreach programs.  Fellows are recruited from
              the entering and current graduate student pool (200+ students) in the biology,
              chemistry, physics, and basic health sciences departments, with an emphasis on
              students from underrepresented populations. Fellows are receiving training in
              learning theory and pedagogy, as advocated by the National Science Education
              Standards, and the specific outreach programs in which the fellows serve as
              apprentices. These include four ongoing outreach programs that deliver science
              equipment and curricula to K-12 students and three professional development
              programs for K-12 science teachers. A new hands-on molecular biology course is
              being developed and implemented in the public schools. Graduate fellows are
              providing expertise in science content and participating in the teaching,
              curriculum development, hands-on science instruction, and mentoring activities
              with K-12 teachers and students.
