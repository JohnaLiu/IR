CISE Educational
              Innovation:  Simulation Science and Education

The goal of this CISE
              Educational Innovation (EI) award is to integrate research results on
              large-scale computational simulation into the undergraduate curriculum.  The
              grant supports the development, testing and dissemination of web-based
              courseware derived primarily from research carried out by the Department of
              Energy ASCI Alliance Center on Simulation of Accidental Fires and Explosions
              (C-SAFE) at the University of Utah.  The courseware is being developed in
              conjunction with Northern Arizona University and Worcester Polytechnic
              Institute as dissemination sites.  Thus, the course material is being utilized
              by three very different undergraduate audiences: (1) a Research 1 institution,
              (2) a private institution whose primary mission is undergraduate education, and
              (3) a four-year institution serving a significant Native American student
              population.   It is expected that the courseware, combined with research
              activity, both at the University of Utah and at the national labs, will create
              a national center for large-scale simulation science and education.
