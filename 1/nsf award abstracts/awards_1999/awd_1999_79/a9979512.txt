Abstract    :
              This project is a three-year collaboration between the University of Rhode
              Island's Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO), Office of Marine Programs
              (OMP), and fourteen marine and environmental academic departments. This
              wide-ranging effort prepares twelve Graduate Teaching Fellows per year to
              engage K-12 teachers and students in inquiry and educational technology
              activities, field exercises, and URI's NSF-funded Living on the Edge exhibit.
              Paired with Faculty Mentors, Fellows are working with Project Staff to directly
              reach 272 teacher participants and more than 13,300 students and their parents,
              many underrepresented, through a suite of formal and informal education.
Two
              activity themes provide the foundation for project activities. Under the
              learning processes theme, content knowledge related to marine and environmental
              topics is being used to enhance student and teacher learning. Methods apply
              cognitive principles and innovative pedagogy.  Incorporated in the technology
              theme, teachers are receiving instruction in the use of the Internet (including
              OMP's interactive site, Discovering Coastal Environments
              (http://omp.gso.uri.edu/doce.htm) to access educational resources and evaluate
              them for use in the classroom. Fellows are also introducing teachers and
              students to other technologies such as GIS, remote sensing, and the
              instrumentation they utilize in their thesis research.
