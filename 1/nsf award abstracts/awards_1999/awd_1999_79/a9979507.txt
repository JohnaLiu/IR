Abstract    :
              Oregon State University in collaboration with 9 schools in 3 school districts (a
              large city setting, a University town setting and a dispersed rural setting)
              placed 14  K-12 Fellows in the system to facilitate the development of active
              science learning.  The Fellows are derived from a variety of disciplines that
              include Molecular and Cellular Biology, Mathematics, Physics, Chemical
              Engineering and Bioresource Engineering.  The Fellows are called "Adopted
              Scientists" in grades K-6 and "Teaching Assistants" in grades 7-12.  They spend
              6 months in the schools and 3 months in extended outreach activities.  
	This
              program will develop active science and mathematics learning through the use of
              5 themes:  (1) Inquiry-based Learning; (2) Communication of Content; (3) Use of
              Appropriate Learning Styles; (4) Use of Technology; and (5) The Research
              Paradigm.
	During the initial tenure (summer), Fellows take 4 courses
              specifically designed for them by the Science and Mathematics Education
              Department (SMED).  In cooperation with the school district teachers, the
              Fellows attend a 2-day workshop.  A weekly seminar series is organized to
              facilitate in-class activities. Teachers from the school districts join the
              Fellows in the workshops at weekly meetings.
	An aggressive performance
              assessment of the Fellows' in-class activities, extended outreach activities,
              and impact of the program is adequately detailed.
