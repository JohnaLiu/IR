Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support to wrap-up this University of Michigan group's
              research program on the L3 experiment at the CERN LEP collider and to embark on
              the Mini-BooNe experiment at Fermilab.

The L3 experiment is now taking data
              above the W+W- threshold at the CERN LEP-II collider exploring a new energy
              range.  These date are being examined to determine the mass and width of the W
              boson, to search for anomalous W interactions, and to search for new particles
              such as the Higgs boson and supersymmetric particles.  The group intends to
              concentrate its effort on Higgs searches.  Funding for continued L3 effort is
              requested in a separate proposal (see K. Riles, PHY-99 84997).  This group
              expects its L3 effort to almost completely end by fall 2000.

The Mini-BooNe
              experiment using the Fermilab booster beam is intended to make a definitive
              test of the tentative neutrino oscillation result, nm   ne, observed by the
              LSND experiment at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The putative LSND signal
              corresponds to a neutrino mass difference of a few tenths of an eV.  This is a
              range of interest if neutrinos serve as the cosmological "hot" dark matter. 
              This experiment is scheduled to begin taking data in 2001, and thus provides a
              good match to the expected end of the group's L3 activity.
