Abstract    :
              The program for Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education at the University of
              Maine is consistent with the State's legislatively mandated goals for education
              in Science and Technology. Twelve Fellows are working in four local school
              districts through this program, which engages colleagues at the University and
              K-12 schools  in transfer of knowledge and curriculum development with respect
              to topics such as Classifying Living Things, Forestry & Pulp and Paper Studies,
              and The Hydrological Cycle.  The project is providing K-12 students and
              teachers with access to curriculum development, field trips, technology, and
              equipment that local school budgets had not provided. A summer "science camp"
              is being used in the training program to establish the teaching teams
              (university faculty and K-12 teachers) that mentor Fellows. The program
              provides SMET fellowships for the University, professional development for K-12
              teachers, important role models and knowledge to K-12 students, and a strong
              bond between the science faculty of the University and K-12 teachers.
