Radio frequency integrated circuits will strongly
              influence the versatility and portability of fu-ture wireless communication
              systems. With the ever increasing demands for higher bandwidth and capacity and
              for reductions in size, weight and cost, the need for more robust and efficient
              RF cir-cuits is expected to increase. In spite of recent advances in wireless
              circuit technology, several bar-riers still remain to be overcome before the
              next generation Low-cost portable systems can be im-plemented. These barriers
              require in-depth investigations in areas of design, modeling, simulation,
              processing, fabrication and testing. In this collaborative effort, we propose
              to integrate resources in these areas in order to implement a state-of-the art
              scheme for the design of future wireless RFICs. This effort will take advantage
              of recent developments in the processing of micro-electro-mechanical (MEM)
              devices as well as other technologies in microwave circuit design and
              process-ing. This integration combined with robust design guidelines and a
              low-cost packaging scheme will represent a substantial step towards the next
              generation communication system.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This proposal is a joint
              effort between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champalgn and the Georgia
              Institute of Technology and is being submitted by both institu-tions.
