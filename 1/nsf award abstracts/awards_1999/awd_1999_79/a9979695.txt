This is a collaborative proposal with
              Oregon State University and Ithaca College.  The Principal Investigators will
              study two potential sources of contaminants that are arctic freshwater
              environments - atmospheric deposition and biological vectors, specifically,
              anadromous fish that carry contaminants from marine to freshwater environments.
               They will investigate the relative importance of these two routes of
              contaminant delivery for freshwater systems of western Alaska using landlocked
              lakes and lakes with a fluvial connection to the sea.

Both the anadromous
              least cisco (Coregonus sardinella) and the freshwater Arctic grayling
              (Thymallus arcticus) are important subsistence species in the western Arctic. 
              In sub-arctic regions, graylings have been found to have higher contaminant
              concentrations and a different fingerprint of organochlorines (OCs)
              contaminants in lakes where they co-exist with sockeye salmon (Onchorhynchus
              nerka).  The Principal Investigators will attempt to determine whether the same
              situation pertains in the Arctic where OCs are believed to be derived primarily
              from atmospheric sources.

Study locations will be chosen in partnership with
              the North Slope Borough Wildlife Department and local communities.  Several
              small interview sessions will be arranged to enable the Principal Investigators
              and the Traditional Ecological Knowledge (local residents) opportunities to
              share information and communicative results.
