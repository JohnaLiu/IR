Abstract    :
              The major goals of this GK-12 project, Partnership for Research in Inquiry-based
              MSE Education (PRIME), are to enhance learning among middle school students,
              teachers, and GK-12 Fellows in math, science, and engineering (MSE); enhance
              the diversity of the MSE workforce; and develop a cadre of scientists and
              engineers who will enter the workforce ready, willing, and able to continuously
              improve the quality of K-12 education in the next century. PRIME is a
              partnership among five Seattle-area school districts; three NSF Local Systemic
              Initiatives; and fifteen academic departments in mathematics, science, and
              engineering, faculty in the College of Education and four diversity programs at
              the University of Washington in Seattle. PRIME's conceptual focus is
              inquiry-based MSE education in middle school settings with diverse student and
              teacher populations. Of 22,585 middle school students potentially affected by
              PRIME, nearly one-fifth (19%) are African American, Native American, or
              Hispanic. A summer learning sciences institute prepares PRIME Fellows to engage
              in partnerships with middle school teachers and students in MSE. This institute
              focuses on middle school learning and teaching, assessment practices, classroom
              instruction, and diversity. The institute prepares the Fellows to engage in
              sustained partnerships with classroom teachers. Fellows provide their
              disciplinary expertise to enhance classroom learning opportunities while also
              developing an increased understanding of pedagogy and diversity. The
              partnerships focus their efforts on the adaptation and localization of
              exemplary curricular materials. PRIME studies these sustained partnerships and
              disseminates the products of their efforts through annual regional showcases
              for teachers.
