Abstract    :
              This project involving the North Carolina State University and Duke University
              Colleges of Engineering, the Research Triangle Science and Math Partnership and
              Wake County Schools focuses on teaching physics, engineering and math to
              diverse populations including students from underrepresented groups in science,
              mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET), hearing-impaired students, and
              students for whom English is a second language.  The underlying theme for the
              entire program provides encouragement to students from groups that are
              underrepresented in SMET through the use of role models and particular teaching
              techniques.  This theme is emphasized in both the recruitment of GK-12 Fellows
              and the teaching of students.  A high percentage of women and individuals from
              underrepresented groups comprise the role model teams.   Activities and modules
              developed for use by the teams include: 1) "Hands-on Engineering",  2)
              exploring engineering in group settings, and 3) basic electricity and
              communication.  Benefits to the K-12 schools include curriculum that integrates
              science, technology, and engineering topics with math, reading, and writing. 
              Benefits to the Fellows include improved communication skills and self-image.
