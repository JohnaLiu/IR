Abstract    :
              The University of Puerto Rico (Rio Piedras campus and Mayaguez campus) in
              collaboration with Puerto Rico's Department of Education (PRDE) provides 45 
              K-12 Fellows as professional development resources for K-12 science and
              mathematics teachers in a constructivist and interdisciplinary approach to key
              concepts in alignment with national standards.  This project is aligned with
              Puerto Rico's statewide systemic initiative.  This project recruits, trains,
              and engages K-12 Fellows as professional development resources in the promotion
              of conceptual understanding of content knowledge for science and mathematics
              teachers in Puerto Rico.   The K-12 Fellows serve in several capacities: 1) as
              professional development resources in the scaling-up effort of the PRSSI
              reform-Phase II, as part of the team of university faculty and lead teachers
              reaching 400 additional schools (25% of the Island's 1,538 schools in the
              public system) to be inducted into the standards-based reform during 2000-2002;
              2) as follow-up to teachers from among the 200 PR-SSI schools that initiated
              the whole school based strategy during Phase II in 1998, which are currently
              completing the professional development program and require assistance in the
              effective implementation of the standards based curriculum; 3) as support to
              cooperating and mentor teachers in the preparation of future and novice
              teachers participating in the Puerto Rico Collaborative for Excellence in
              Teacher Preparation (PR-CETP) who are carrying out their practicum and
              induction experience in PR-SSI schools; 4) as co-teachers with K-12 teachers
              and serving as role models of future scientists, mathematicians and engineers
              for K-12 students. The K-12 Fellows are prepared for this activity by means of
              a year-long program consisting of:  (1) four-day retreat (summer),  (2) two
              workshops during the year,   (3) monthly meetings and  (4) Field Experiences.
              Performance assessment parallels the SSI and CETP programs that are in place. 
              The main purpose of the research-based evaluation is to translate data from
              multiple sources into meaningful information that is used to drive the systemic
              reform in Puerto Rico.
