Abstract    :
              This project builds on successful reforms in hands-on engineering education that
              are the core of the Integrated Teaching and Learning (ITL) Program in the
              College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Colorado at
              Boulder. Twenty graduate and 8 undergraduate GK-12 Fellows, comprehensively
              trained as "engineering ambassadors," are delivering the pedagogy and
              engineering content pioneered in the ITL Program over the past seven years.
              Each Fellow is paired with a faculty mentor selected for his/her demonstrated
              interest in engineering outreach.
The GK-12 program is creating a significant
              partnership between the College and K-12 schools to extend the success of the
              ITL undergraduate engineering program by providing a unique graduate student
              learning and mentoring experience that impacts the K-12 community of learners.
              The Fellows serve as classroom agents to help teachers better prepare students
              for a world increasingly dependent on engineering and technology through the
              integration of technology-enhanced, hands-on learning components with math,
              physical science and technology curricula. Fellows impact K-12 students with
              diverse learning styles through the use of project-based, hands-on learning,
              while assisting K-12 teachers in gaining content knowledge on engineering and
              technology as vehicles to address appropriate state educational standards. 
A
              number of formative and summative evaluation methods are being used to assess
              and continuously refine the many facets of the program. In addition to
              providing classroom support and encouraging more K-12 students to pursue
              technical careers, the project helps legitimize outreach as a valid and
              worthwhile academic endeavor for graduate students and engineering faculty.
