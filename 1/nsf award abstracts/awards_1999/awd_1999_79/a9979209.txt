	The 2000 Seminar on Stochastic Processes will be held at
              the University of Utah from March 16 to 18, 2000.  The seminars have become one
              of the most important regular seminar series for probabilists.  They attract
              and bring together an active group of eminent researchers and young specialists
              in probability and stochastic processes.  This award will provide travel
              support for participants.  The funds will be used primarily for women and
              junior researchers.
