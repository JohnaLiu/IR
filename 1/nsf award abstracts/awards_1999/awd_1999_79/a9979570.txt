Abstract    :
              The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine - Dunbar High School NSF GK-12
              Graduate Teaching Fellows Program (Hopkins-Dunbar Fellows Program) matches
              Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine PhD students (Fellows) with mentor
              teachers at Paul Lawrence Dunbar High School in teaching apprenticeships.  The
              Fellows receive formal training in classroom teaching and serve as
              student-teachers in science and biotechnology classrooms at Dunbar High School.
               The overall goal of this program is to improve the quality and depth of
              science education at the high school and to empower the students with improved
              learning skills.  The Fellows serve as important content resources to Dunbar
              teachers and allow the teachers to fully utilize biotechnology and information
              technology as teaching and learning tools.  The Fellows benefit through
              improved skills in communication, presentation, and organization.  The
              Hopkins-Dunbar Fellows Program is also helping to foster interest of
              underrepresented minority groups in biomedicine and related fields.  This
              program should also have a favorable effect on the pool of local
              underrepresented minority students interested in careers in science.
