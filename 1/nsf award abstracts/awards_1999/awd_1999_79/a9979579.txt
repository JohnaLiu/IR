Abstract    :
              Manipulatives, motivation, mentoring (M3) - these are the three themes this
              GK-12 project is using to create a technologically innovative highway that is
              empowering K-12 students with science, math, engineering, and technology (SMET)
              skills and thus broadening their career opportunities. The project uses Hybrid
              and electric vehicles as the platform for investigation and discovery in new,
              emerging, and environmentally responsible fields that affect not only
              individuals in our society, but also society in America as a whole.
              Manipulatives such as addition and subtraction conceptualization in the early
              years, alternative fuel engine simulation in junior high, design and analysis
              of semi-conductor solar panels in high school, and graphical computer-based
              education tools throughout these years, are providing visualization of
              real-world systems. Through exposure to the frontiers of discovery in
              electronics, power systems, computer-based control, system dynamics, safety,
              etc., this project is developing a vision that motivates students to master
              SMET fundamentals. Mentoring relationships are bringing the skills, vision, and
              enthusiasm of successful engineering graduate and undergraduate students into
              the lives of grades K- 12 children. M3 education is being constructed via a
              partnership between three participating Pennsylvania school districts, the
              Women in Science and Engineering Program with General Motors support, and Penn
              State University's Colleges of Engineering, Science, Earth and Mineral
              Sciences, and Education.
