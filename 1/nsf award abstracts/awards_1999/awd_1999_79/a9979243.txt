              ABSTRACT
CTS-9979243
Eric W. Kaler/Carlyle B. Storm
Gordon Research
              Center

The purpose of the conference is to encourage the transfer of ideas
              and information in the community of engineers and scientists who work in the
              fields of colloidal or macromolecules assemblies and supramolecular aggregates.
              

Topics include nanosized materials, polymer architecture and dynamics,
              molecular and meso-scale assembly techniques, photochemistry in organized
              systems, and biomolecular assemblies and their applications.
 
The schedule
              for the week is that of a traditional Gordon Conference, formal presentations
              by leading experts in the morning and evenings with plenty of time for
              discussions.  The afternoons are free for informal discussion and meetings. 
              Poster sessions are planned for attendees, including graduate students and
              postdoctoral fellows as well as faculty members, to present their recent
              work.
