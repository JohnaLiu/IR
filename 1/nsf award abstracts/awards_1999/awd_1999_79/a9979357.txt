The primary goal of this program is the development of
              fully-integrated Schottky receiver and transmitter front-ends for wireless
              applications at submillimeter-wave frequencies. Schottky diodes represent the
              most successful device technology for room temperature heterodyne receivers and
              harmonic generators at frequencies above 150 GHz and this project aims at
              developing a reliable and robust device technology base for submillimeter-wave
              wireless systems by applying MMIC processing technology to Schottky front-ends.
              The scope of the project incorporates three main tasks: (1) the development of
              a processing technology for diode-based monolithic millimeter-wave integrated
              circuits (MMIC's), (2) the use and integration of electromagnetic and device
              simulation tools for IC transceiver design, and (3) the application of
              diode-based MMIC's to the design and realization of fully integrated
              transmitter and receiver front-ends operating at submillimeter-wave
              frequencies. The project will culminate in the demonstration of a fully
              integrated communications link operating at 220 Ghz.
