Abstract    :
              ATM9979454abs

The investigators will study the chemistry of meteoric metals
              in the mesosphere, the dynamics of the stratosphere and mesosphere, interaction
              of dynamics and chemistry in the mesosphere, meteoric input, and noctilucent
              clouds.  The study will use observations made by two resonance lidar systems
              and one Rayleigh lidar located at Poker Flat, Alaska.  The resonance lidar
              systems will make simultaneous common volume observations of two species in the
              mesopause region during each observation period (sodium and iron, or sodium and
              ionized calcium, or sodium and potassium).  The lidar observations will be
              supplemented by measurements made with an OH interferometer, all-sky camera,
              photometer, magnetometer, and MF radar.  The observational data will be used to
              develop chemical models and dynamical models of the mesopause region.  The two
              sets of metal observations will force consistency in the chemical models while
              the Rayleigh lidar measurements will quantify the tidal and wave activity that
              propagates upward from the lower atmosphere.  The measurements will also
              provide data for assessing the role of the next generation solid-state based
              wind/temperature lidar systems in the polar regions.
