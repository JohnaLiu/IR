CISE
              Educational Innovation: Creating a flexible undergraduate program in computer
              science:  curriculum, educational technology and pedagogy

This CISE
              Educational Innovation project provides funds to develop a new undergraduate
              curriculum that facilitates rapid inclusion of research, incorporates advances
              in educational technology, and encourages innovation in teaching and in student
              learning.  The project involves a consortium of five colleges, the several
              units of the University of Massachusetts, and utilizes the experiences in
              distance education, industrial relations, and technology transfer of the
              department.  The project addresses four areas: curriculum development;
              educational technology; new pedagogy; and leveraging partnerships.  The project
              seeks to achieve three goals: to maintain the curriculum at the cutting edge of
              telecommunications and computing; to accommodate students with varied
              backgrounds, motivations and educational goals; and to motivate faculty to
              evolve and adopt new educational pedagogy.  Assessment and evaluation are
              incorporated in the project from the beginning and it is expected that the
              project will have a significant impact in undergraduate education.
