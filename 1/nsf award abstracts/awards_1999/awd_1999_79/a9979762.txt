Abstract    :
              The coupling of the ionosphere to the magnetosphere is a critical component to
              the understanding of the dynamics of energy flow in these regions.  This
              project will address the coupling that results from the interaction of the
              polar wind with the field-aligned electric potential drops that produce the
              so-called "inverted V" signature in ion energy spectrograms.  The coupling
              process takes place on all spatial scales down to the ion gyroradius and this
              program will address the interaction mechanisms at all these scales.  The
              program will determine the relative importance of a variety of phenomena,
              including the mirror force, convection, conduction, diffusion, and
              wave-particle interactions.  This work will build on the transport model
              developed by the PI under prior NSF support.
