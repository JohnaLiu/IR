Abstract    :
              The purpose of the conference is to give researchers in finite element methods a
              working knowledge of some important recent developments and open questions in
              finite element superconvergence.  This knowledge will in turn, enhance the
              development of adaptive finite element methods which are widely used in
              scientific computing and engineering practice.

The conference will provide
              an oppportunity for mathematicians to communicate with engineers in the fields
              and to learn some recent results on finite element superconvergence in the
              engineering community.  The conference will train new comers in the fields,
              including facult, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate students, all over the
              mid-west area.

Professor Lars Wahlbin of Cornell University will present a
              series of ten expository lectures on "Finite Element Superconvergence" at Texas
              Tech University.  The speaker has played a leading role in the development of
              this subject, and in many of the significant results.

The lectures will
              provide an introduction to the main techniques of the field, and survey the
              major recent developments and open problems.  Only a few other lectures will be
              scheduled, in order to leave plenty of time for informal discussions among the
              conference participants.
