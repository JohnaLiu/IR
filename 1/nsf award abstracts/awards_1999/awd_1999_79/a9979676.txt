This request is for funding to subsidize the travel costs of
              students to allow their participation in the Beauty'99 conference to be held in
              Bled, Slovenia on 21 thru 25 June 1999.  This conference is the principal
              conference in High Energy Physics devoted exclusively to a detailed comparison
              of the many experiments currently operating or being planned in the area of
              b-quark physics. This is one of the most prestigious area of High Energy
              Physics with seven major experimental programs in the US and overseas currently
              underway. This series of conferences, held every year since 1993, is well
              regarded in the field.  The entire request is for funds to subsidize the
              attendance of students and post-doctoral associates who would otherwise be
              unable to attend this meeting.
