The investigators will combine
              measurements of atomic oxygen emissions during twilight with digital ionosonde
              measurements to study the response of precipitating conjugate photoelectrons to
              variations in solar and geomagnetic activity during the upcoming solar maximum
              period, and to compare the results with predictions from the Field-aligned
              Interhemispheric Plasma (FLIP) model.  The observations consist of photometric
              measurements of the 630 and 844.6 nm atomic oxygen airglow emission rates over
              two winters at the Clemson Atmospheric Research Laboratory.  The emission rate
              at 630 nm caused by conjugate photoelectron impact is determined by subtraction
              of the model estimate for the local emission from the photometer observations. 
              These results and the observed 844.6 nm emissions would be compared with the
              FLIP predictions of nightglow enhancements generated by conjugate photoelectron
              fluxes.  These results would provide insight as to possible plasmasphere
              variations of transparency with latitude or longitude or with changes in solar
              and geomagnetic activity.
