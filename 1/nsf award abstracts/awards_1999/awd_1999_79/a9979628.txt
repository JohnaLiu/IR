Abstract    :
              This GK-12 program,  K-through-Infinity Professional Development Partnership
              (K--+-PDP) is more closely coupling K-12 education with the excitement of
              discovery, and the understanding of scientific knowledge, experienced by
              "fellows"-graduate students and upper-division undergraduate students in the
              fields of science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET). The project
              is promoting and facilitating collaboration between university faculty and K-12
              educators to effect a new type of university training that produces a
              generation of SMET professionals who are skilled in, and committed to, SMET
              education and service learning at all levels.
The ways that university
              researchers view and do science are important benefits that are now being
              shared with students and teachers in the K-12 schools. This initiative is
              providing K-12 students with the opportunity to learn how to do science from
              the example of a researcher who probes the unknown everyday.  This program is
              transforming teachers into people who see themselves as "scientist-teachers,"
              and transforming graduate student fellows-and by extension, their faculty
              advisors-into " teacher-scientists."
