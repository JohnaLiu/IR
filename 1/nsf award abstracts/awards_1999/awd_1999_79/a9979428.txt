The PIs propose the development of miniature low-power
              front-ends for 4.9 GHz (or 5.7 GHz) and 28 GHz applications.  FCC has selected
              these frequencies for wideband high-data rate communications over relatively
              short distances (from 30 m inside buildings to 3-5 km for outdoor use). 
              Currently, the electronics (Si and GaAs devices) for such systems as low-noise
              amplifiers, balanced mixers, medium power amplifiers, and the
              voltage-controlled oscillators/phase-locked loop are quite mature.  Actually,
              it is the off-chip components such as the frequency selection filters for the
              RF front-end, high-Q resonator structures for the RF oscillators, and the
              planar high-efficiency antennas which are currently the limiting components in
              low cost front-ends.  They also propose to investigate novel, and in some
              cases, revolutionary, approaches to build very high-Q resonators, low-loss
              filters, and high efficiency antennas.
