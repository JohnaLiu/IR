Abstract    :
              The project is a partnership between the Detroit Public School System, six
              departments in the College of Science (Physics, Biology, Geology, Mathematics,
              Chemistry, and Computer Science), and the College of Education on the Wayne
              State University campus.  Teams of graduate and advanced-undergraduate students
              from the mathematics and science departments are working with pre-service
              students and teachers to enhance the classroom efforts of teachers in the
              Detroit Public Schools, with emphasis on the middle grades.  Formal preparation
              of the fellows for their K-12 classroom experience is being accomplished
              through workshops planned and implemented by the two colleges using the input
              of master teachers from the middle schools with current classroom experience. 
              In addition, the participating teachers are reviewing fundamentals and learning
              about current research in the fellows' fields through formal workshops designed
              to support joint classroom-activity planning by the fellows and teachers
              involved.  The project supports the science and mathematics standards adopted
              by the Detroit Public School System and enhances materials currently in use in
              the schools.
