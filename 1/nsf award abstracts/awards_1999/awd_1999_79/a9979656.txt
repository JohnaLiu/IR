Abstract    :
              

Based on the theme "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of
              evolution", the Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology (EECB) Graduate
              Program has entered into a partnership with the State Department of Education
              to enhance K-12 education in the biological sciences. Students in the EECB
              program comprise some of the best students in the biological sciences at the
              University of Hawaii, and by taking their field-oriented thesis research
              programs into the K-12 classroom they are developing a science education
              program that is motivating and stimulating K-12 students into considering
              science as a career opportunity. The program is providing an opportunity for
              EECB students to improve the content knowledge and inquiry skills of the
              students and teachers at K-12 schools in Hawaii. The program is also conducting
              a series of courses that provide students selected as GK-12 Fellows with the
              learning processes, knowledge transfer/curriculum development techniques, and
              the teaching and learning tools to enable them to work effectively with K-12
              students and teachers.
