Abstract    :
              Through this three-year Cornell Environmental Sciences Research Partnerships
              program (CERP), 27 graduate and 15 undergraduate GK-12 fellows are guiding
              middle and high school students in conducting scientific research. Fellows are
              working intensively in 10 core schools in the vicinity of Ithaca, NY, and are
              conducting teacher workshops and shorter research projects with students in 15
              satellite schools in NYC and rural, upstate NY. They are drawing on curricula
              and models for high school student and teacher research developed through
              eight, previously funded NSF programs at Cornell. 

High school students are
              developing the ability to conduct original research, participating in classroom
              and Internet-mediated research communities, and enhancing their understanding
              of the nature of science and environmental sciences content. Teachers are
              enhancing their ability to guide student researchers and developing
              partnerships with universities and community organizations. GK-12 fellows are
              developing leadership, mentoring, and teaching skills, the ability to work in
              multidisciplinary teams, and partnerships that aid them in their research and
              future job search. Their work with students is also helping them formulate
              ideas and collect data for their thesis research. An important outcome of CERP
              is new models for high school student research, which are being disseminated
              nationwide.
