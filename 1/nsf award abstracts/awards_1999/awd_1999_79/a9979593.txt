Abstract    :
              This program, a project of the College of Engineering with collaborative support
              from the Department of Education at Tufts University and the Nashoba Regional
              School District, is infusing the K-10 curriculum with engineering approaches
              and activities that are aligned with the new Massachusetts Science and
              Technology/Engineering Standards by placing engineering and computer science
              students (fellows) in the classrooms. Using their backgrounds, and equipped
              with a set of hands-on engineering-based project ideas and pedagogy know-how,
              the fellows are working with teacher liaisons to introduce engineering
              principles into the K-10 grades.  The material being introduced conforms with
              the recently developed Massachusetts Standards for Science and
              Technology/Engineering and National Standards of Technology and Science.  This
              material is being collected and created by an experienced team of Tufts
              faculty, K-12 professionals and graduate students.  This is the first systemic
              and formal attempt to introduce engineering throughout the K-10 student
              experiences, with special emphasis on middle school.  As a by-product, it is
              expected that this program will lead to new and productive collaborations
              between engineers and mathematical scientists, educators, and education
              researchers, and create a model program for engineering education in K-12
              environments.
