Abstract    :
              In partnership with Hewlett Packard Foundation, the Boston Public Schools, the
              Boston Museum of Science, and the New England Aquarium, Northeastern University
              will develop and implement a training program for graduate teaching fellows and
              K-12 classroom teachers in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology
              (SMET).  The goal is to support teachers in their efforts to increase student
              excellence in SMET, improve achievement scores, and better prepare classroom
              students for future careers in an increasingly complex technological society. 
              The program will use a systematic approach to assess classroom needs, develop
              material that incorporates Boston Public Schools curriculum standards and is
              attuned to the needs of a diverse student population.  Discipline-specific
              teams comprised of Northeastern University faculty and graduate fellows will
              work with the classroom teachers to create lessons.  The graduate students will
              serve as the conduit between classroom teachers and Northeastern University
              faculty.
