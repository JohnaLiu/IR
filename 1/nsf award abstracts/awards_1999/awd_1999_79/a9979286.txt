Abstract    :
              This proposal will address three important and highly synergistic technical
              challenges for successful implementation of future generation millimeter-wave
              wireless communications systems, i.e., device, antenna and propagation, within
              a unified context. The concept of active integrated antennas will be explored
              extensively for optimal designing of both high-efficiency transmitting
              amplifiers and high-sensitivity receivers with adaptive capabilities. For
              instance, a novel push-pull power amplifier with integrated planar antennas for
              harmonic tuning and power combining, and a broadband, MMIC-compatible receiving
              array integrated with our recently invented quasi-Yagi antennas will be
              developed. To reach the proposed design objectives, unconventional CAD
              approaches such as global antenna/circuit/device EM simulation, and measurement
              techniques unique to highly integrated RF front ends, will be investigated as
              well.
