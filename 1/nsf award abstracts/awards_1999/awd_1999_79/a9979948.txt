Abstract    :
              This research project consists of the development and testing of technologically
              enriched Language Environment Enrichment Program (TLEEP) used by early
              childhood teachers, supervisors, and families to improve literacy learning for
              young children nationwide. The technology enrichment will include interactive
              television (ITV) and web-based instruction. 

The specific activities
              include:

Broadcast instructional ITV from Massachusetts to teachers and
              supervisors in New England, Maryland, and North Carolina for interactive
              professional development

Electronic meeting places for teachers and
              supervisors

The development of a sophisticated web site for parents to help
              improve the literacy learning of their children that can be accessed from
              school and home

An assessment of the affect that the above projects have on
              learning

Results of the project will be an assessment of what works and what
              does not and materials for replicating the successful aspects of the project
              nationwide.
