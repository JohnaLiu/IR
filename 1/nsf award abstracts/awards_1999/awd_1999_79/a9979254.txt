Abstract    :
              The differential geometry study of differential equations has a long and
              distinguished history, going back to the classical papers of Lie, Darboux and
              E. Cartan.  Their ideas have been at the source of many subsequent developments
              which have had a great impact in several areas of current interest in pure and
              applied mathematics, including the theory of completeley integrabale evolution
              equations and their soliton solutions, conservation laws, the calculus of
              variations, and the theory of infinite-dimensional Lie groups.  The aim of
              Professor Kamran in these lectures will be to give a reasonably self-contained
              account of some of the most significant recent developments which have arisen
              in this way from the differential study of differential equations.
