Abstract    :
              This project will investigate an innovative, technology-enabled approach to
              elementary reading - an automated reading tutor that displays stories on a
              computer screen, listens to children read aloud, and helps them learn to read.
              Experimental use in an urban elementary school has provided initial evidence of
              the Reading Tutor's ability to engage students in sustained assisted reading.
              In a four-month controlled study, children who used the Reading Tutor gained
              significantly more in reading comprehension than classmates who spent the same
              time in regular activities.  

The main question addressed by the project is
              the efficacy of the Reading Tutor when used in real classrooms. The experiments
              include an evaluation of the Reading Tutor's longitudinal effects on student
              progress, compared to commercial software and to human tutors. Expected
              outcomes include demonstrating the effectiveness of speech-recognition-enabled
              assistance in building and assessing reading skills, and establishing how much
              various type so learners, problems, and skill sets benefit from such
              assistance.

Sustainability and scalability will be addressed by analyzing
              and addressing key factors at the interface between technology and the
              classroom that affect the amount of usage of the system. Experiments with
              successive prototypes of a Reading Tutor that runs on commercially available
              computers will lay research foundations for transition of it and other
              educational software into affordable, effective, scalable interventions that
              can make a real difference in children's education.
