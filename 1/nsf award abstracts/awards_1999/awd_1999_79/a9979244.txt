              ABSTRACT


	This project is a collaborative academic/industrial research
              (GOALI) project to investigate the transport of supercritical hydrocarbon/CO2
              mixtures in microporous carbon molecular-sieve membranes. The study will
              proceed in two parts: (1) preparation and experimental characterization of the
              membrane along with computational modeling of the evolution of its structure
              during synthesis; and (2) measurement and simultaneous computer simulation of
              the sorption and transport of supercritical mixtures within the membranes.  The
              systems under study are supercritical mixtures composed of CO2 and one or more
              of the following hydrocarbons, butane, isobutane, benzene, and toluene.  These
              hydrocarbons were selected to represent typical aliphatic and aromatic
              compounds and to permit exploration of  factors such as molecular shape. 
              Non-equilibrium grand canonical molecular dynamics (NEGCMD) simulation
              techniques are being used to study the transport of these mixtures in
              microporous materials.  The objective of the molecular calculations is to
              relate and correlate the membrane's molecular structure with experimentally
              observed transport properties and separation efficacy.  The long-term goal is
              to achieve reliable engineering and design of improved materials for molecular
              sieves and catalytic-membrane reactors.   

The results of these studies will
              contribute to applications such as the regeneration of adsorbents by
              supercritical CO2 and the use of membranes under supercritical conditions. 
              Carbon molecular- sieve membranes are capable of withstanding the high
              pressures and temperatures associated with supercritical conditions.  They can
              be prepared with well-controlled porosity and pore size and a very narrow
              pore-size distribution.  Understanding the factors determining the ability of
              these materials to effect separations of supercritical mixtures based on
              differences in molecular mobility within the membranes will promote their use
              in the removal of various contaminants from water, sludges, soils, spent
              catalysts, and adsorbents like granular activated carbon.  The ability to
              remove solutes continuously from supercritical carbon dioxide would produce
              significant reductions in operating costs compared with the energy-intensive
              expansion/re-compression cycle normally used to separate solutes from
              supercritical solvents.
