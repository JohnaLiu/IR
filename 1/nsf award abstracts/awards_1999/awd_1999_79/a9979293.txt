This Pan American Advanced Institutes award, jointly supported
              by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will consist of a two-week
              course on modern trends in heat transfer.  The course will be held in the
              summer of 2000 in San Luis Potosi, Mexico with instructors and graduate
              students from across the Americas.  Eight prominent heat transfer researchers
              from Canada, the U.S.,  Mexico and Argentina have agreed to lecture, and the
              Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi has agreed to host the course, provide
              the facilities, and make local arrangements.  The contents of the course will
              include analytical, numerical and experimental aspects of natural-circulation
              loops, oscillatory convection, conjugate heat transfer processes, chaotic
              advection, two-phase heat transfer, gas-droplets flows, and artificial neural
              networks.  The course will combine advanced graduate-level lectures with
              cutting-edge research seminars.  It will involve extensive discussions in small
              and large groups as well as panel sessions to encourage interaction between
              faculty and students and lay the groundwork for future collaboration.
