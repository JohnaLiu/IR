This Americas Program award will support a US-Brazil research
              project between Dr. See-Chen Ying and Dr. J. Michael Kosterlitz of Brown
              University and Dr. Enzo Granato and Dr. Mauricio Baldan at the National
              Institute for Space Research (INPE) in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil.  The goal
              of the project is to investigate the dynamics and growth of lattice systems. 
              Included are xperimental and theoretical studies of driven lattices in a random
              potential, dislocation nucleation in epitaxial layers, and critical dynamics
              and adatom diffusion near a surface reconstruction transition.
