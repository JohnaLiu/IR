Abstract    :
              Rice University and two University of Houston campuses are joining the Houston
              Independent School District to create an innovative program that teams master
              and novice middle school teachers with SMET undergraduate and graduate
              students, designated as GK-12 Fellows.  Seven four-member teams are working
              together over a fifteen month fellowship period in an exchange of content
              knowledge and pedagogy.
The program includes the following major features:
* 
                 Fellows are introduced to K-12 education by participating in teacher
              enhancement programs at the participating universities. After spending an
              entire academic year working with their teacher team-mates, GK-12 Fellows serve
              as instructors in these same teacher enhancement programs during the last three
              months of their fellowship.
*      Teams design a two-semester project that
              involves the middle school students of the participating teachers.  Projects
              focus on one of three themes: curriculum development, learning processes, or
              integration of instructional technology into the K-12 science and mathematics
              curriculum.
*      In addition to their time on K-12 campuses, Fellows
              participate in a weekly seminar on precollege science and mathematics
              educational reform.
*      Fellows serve as role models for middle school
              students as they provide instructional assistance to their teacher
              teammates.
Our universities have a long history of working closely with the
              local school district to meet identified needs. This program strengthens and
              expands the already established relationships among the participating
              institutions, provides K-12 teachers with an exceptional professional
              development opportunity and their students with enriched instruction in science
              and mathematics, at the same time preparing graduate and undergraduate students
              to support K-12 education in their future careers.
