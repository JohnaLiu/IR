Abstract    :
              The North Mississippi GK-12 Project is providing fourteen Fellows from eight
              SMET related disciplines to two local school districts, where they are serving
              on interdisciplinary teams as resources for the local teachers. This goals of
              this GK-12 Project include:  1) communicating SMET content, applications, and
              career paths to students and teachers in the Oxford and Lafayette County school
              districts; 2) providing the location and/or development of a growing supply of
              high quality SMET instructional activities, laboratory exercises, software, and
              demonstrations to expand and enhance the educational practices in use by K-12
              teachers and students; and 3) increasing the ability of the teachers and
              Fellows to effectively utilize technology as a means to enhance the education
              of the students.
The school districts are benefiting from the variety of newly
              developed materials, the increased ability to effectively utilize technology in
              the educational process, and the meaningful interaction between teachers,
              students, and the Fellows. Benefits to the Fellows include a better
              understanding of pedagogical best-practices, and an increased understanding of
              the various student needs. Benefits to The University of Mississippi include
              the recruitment of excellent Fellows, better relationships with the local
              schools, and improved communications between SMET related departments.
