Abstract    :
              This project places science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET)
              graduate students from Michigan Technological University (MTU) into schools of
              the Copper Country Intermediate School District (CCISD) to serve as resource
              consultants to K-12 teachers.  The goals of the project include:  1) improving
              mathematics and science programs in the schools, 2) improving the communication
              and teaching skills for the SMET fellows, and 3) disseminating the best ideas
              and practices that are evolving from the project.  
The GK-12 fellows are:
              1)developing science and mathematics experiments to enable students to actively
              engage in doing and learning the subject, 2) developing family math, family
              science, and family computing programs,  3) helping teachers apply the tools of
              technology, and 4) sharing their special interests and career options within
              their major field of study. 
The GK-12 fellows and cooperating teachers are
              also hosting a two day hands-on summer workshop for 75 Upper Peninsula K-12
              mathematics and science teachers. The workshop will have a space odyssey theme
              and will be held during the summer of the year 2001.
