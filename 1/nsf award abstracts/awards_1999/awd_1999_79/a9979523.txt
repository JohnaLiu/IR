Abstract    :
              SMET graduate students at West Virginia University are providing content and
              instructional support to middle school teachers through a project involving
              West Virginia University Colleges of Arts & Sciences, Engineering & Mineral
              Resources, and Human Resources & Education.  As a part of TIGERS (Teams of
              Interdisciplinary Graduate- Fellows Engaged to Reinvigorate Students about
              SMET), three teams of four graduate students are formed around
              interdisciplinary themes that are a part of normal instruction in middle school
              science under Project CATS (Coordinated and Thematic Science). TIGERS fellows
              and 12 middle school teachers work together during the summer to pool their
              strengths of content and pedagogy in organizing thematic mathematics and
              science instruction to be implemented in the fall. TIGERS fellows share the
              insights gained from their research, while teachers share an appreciation for
              the middle school learner and school context. During the academic year, the
              teams of TIGER fellows visit the participating schools, facilitating science
              and mathematics instruction through hands-on learning experiences, long-term
              investigations, and field experiences. Upon completion of their experience,
              TIGERS fellows have an enhanced capacity to integrate their content experience
              with pedagogy as they become the professoriate and professionals of tomorrow.
