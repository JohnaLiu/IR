Abstract    :
              This GK-12 project is a collaborative effort by Vanderbilt University, Meharry
              Medical College, and the Davidson County Metropolitan School District to
              enhance 7-12th grade science and technology education through the use of
              teaching fellows as resource persons for teachers.  Teacher-mentors who are
              recognized as expert teachers by their peers and supervisors are participants
              in this program. Twelve graduate and two advanced undergraduate teaching
              fellows from Vanderbilt and Meharry are participating in the project each year.
              Faculty members from graduate programs in chemistry, physics, biological
              sciences (eight departments), chemical engineering, biomedical engineering, and
              environmental engineering are serving as mentors.  The teaching fellows are
              assisting the teachers in the implementation of an integrated 7-12th grade
              science curriculum, as well as helping teachers to match the local core
              curriculum with national and state science standards. The main objectives for
              7-12th grade students are to increase inquiry-based activities, enhance science
              literacy, develop positive attitudes about science, provide individual
              attention for students through tutoring and mentoring, and provide role models
              for students. The objectives for teachers are to increase science content
              knowledge and the use of computer technology, and enhance communication links
              between teachers and the learning community.  Goals for teaching fellows
              include learning how to transform their science knowledge into an appropriate
              form for understanding by students and teachers (and the general public), and
              developing an appreciation for the professionalism of teachers.
