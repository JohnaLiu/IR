Abstract    :
              This research involves a novel adaptive and scalable wireless network
              architecture utilizing a mixture of cellular and packet radio network
              topologies for broadband multimedia communications. The architecture enables
              rapid adaptability to traffic, channel and interference conditions and will
              result in significant reductions in transmit power and potential throughput
              improvements. We investigate techniques that, by coordination among physical,
              data link, and network layers enable significant improvements in capacity and
              quality of service relative to the current state-of-the-art. 


The main
              thrust of our research consists of selective use of multiuser detection;
              self-organization; and adaptive routing. We consider multiuser detection
              techniques that exploit information available at the data link layer.
              Specifically, we are investigating the benefits of error detection side
              information in aiding interference cancellation and suppression. Research in
              self-organizing involves network connectivity optimization and allocation of
              resources. This optimization adapts network to topological changes on a
              relatively longer time scale. Network adaptation to physical and application
              layer attributes is primarily accomplished via adaptive routing. The
              investigators are evaluating the suitability of centralized and distributed, or
              perhaps hybrid, routing approaches. It is desired to provide rapid adaptation
              to changes in traffic and channel conditions, including interference, as well
              as changes in quality of service requirements.
