Abstract    :
              Clarkson University in collaboration with 3 local school districts places 20
              graduate students and 7 undergraduate students in local school districts to
              facilitate a "Problem Based Learning" (PBL) experience for the 7th and 8th
              grades with faculty collaboration from SUNY-Potsdam.  This project is providing
              a learning experience within a multidisciplinary atmosphere creating a direct
              link between basic science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) and
              their relevance to the solution of societal problems. Graduate and
              undergraduate fellows are using this pedagogical technique as a means to
              enhance the teaching of SMET in area schools while simultaneously increasing
              the interest in SMET subjects by the K-12 student population. The year-long
              curriculum is exposing 7th and 8th grade students to a wide variety of SMET
              concepts as they solve problems associated with environmental contamination
              that have direct impacts on their community.  Specific modules associated with
              the overall problem are being adapted to target high school and elementary
              school levels. The curriculum includes two initial projects, solid waste
              management at the school and the hazards of human exposure to environmental
              lead. The fellows are distributed across SMET disciplines at Clarkson. Through
              this process the fellows are also gaining a better understanding of problem
              solving strategies, and valuable experience in teaching and communication.
              Additional activities include:  1) seminars and a three-credit course to
              prepare the fellows; 2) workshops for teacher training in technology
              applications and PBL methodology; 3) partnership meetings for review of
              on-going projects and assessment of outcomes, and; 4) presentation of results
              to external review groups and educational societies.
