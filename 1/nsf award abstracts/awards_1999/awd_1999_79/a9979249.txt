The projects described in this Minority Research Planning Grant
              will be conducted over an 18 month  period.  They are concerned principally
              with the effects of processing parameters on the microstructure development in
              polymer processing, in particular extrusion mixing and injection molding -
              leading to the formation of self-reinforcing micro-and nanocomposites.  More
              specifically, experimental and numerical simulation methodologies will be
              developed to evaluate the interrelationships between the process parameter and
              morphology development during processing of blends of a liquid crystalline
              polymer and a flexible-coil thermoplastic, the latter serving as the matrix
              polymer. This blend is often referred to variously as "in-situ composites",
              "self-reinforcing composites", or " molecular composites".

These research
              results should provide the basis for development of a competitive research
              proposal.  In addition, they will be closely integrated with educational
              activities at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as with
              extensive mentoring and outreach.
