The
              phenomenon of cloud cavitation, and its quite substantial and negative impact,
              is ubiquitous in hydraulic machinery.  Hence, the successful execution of the
              proposed research will have a significant impact on the prediction and
              avoidance of this phenomenon.  The co-investigators bring their respective
              computational and experimental strengths to this investigation.  It is expected
              that significant publications and student preparation will result.
