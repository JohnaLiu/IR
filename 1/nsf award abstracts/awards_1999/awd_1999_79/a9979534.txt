Abstract    :
              The Fifth World Congress of the Bernoulli Society will take place in Guanajuato,
              Mexico, 15-21 May, 2000, joint with the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Institute of
              Mathematical Statistics. The last such joint meeting occurred in 1994 at Chapel
              Hill. These meetings constitute a basic component of the infrastructure for
              scholarly exchange of ideas on an international level in the fields of
              Probability and Mathematical Statistics. They are the natural forum where to
              discuss and present the most important advances in these fields occurred during
              the previous five years. In particular, the Invited Program for this Congress
              consists of (1) twelve invited one hour lectures, including the IMS Wald
              Lectures, given by worldwide leaders in several of the
subfields, ranging from
              statistical applications in Genetics and probabilistic applications in Finance
              to the most theoretical areas of Statistics and Stochastic Processes; and (2)
              thirty nine Invited Paper Sessions representing a large variety of areas where
              substantial progress has recently occurred. An special effort has been made by
              the Program Committee to balance Probability, Statistics and their
              Applications. Given the
worldwide scope of the Congress and the quality of the
              Program, its attendance by young researchers will be specially useful as an
              opportunity for starting contacts with distinguished researchers from all over
              the world, for exposure to a significant amount of the best research being
              conducted today, in particular learning of the most important current
              directions of research, and for disseminating their own work on a scale rarely
              provided by other meetings.  This project provides partial support for Junior
              participants.
