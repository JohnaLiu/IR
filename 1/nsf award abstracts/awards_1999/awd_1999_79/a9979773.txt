CISE Educational
              Innovation:  Building Complex Systems at Low Cost

This CISE Educational
              Innovation (EI) project provides support to develop educational kits to be
              widely distributed that will allow undergraduate students to effectively learn
              how to design complex systems at low cost.  The kits consist of a prototyping
              card, with network capability, with a book with companion materials.  There is
              a strong team involving the University of Hawaii, several industrial
              organizations and a publisher.  
The plan of the project is in accordance with
              the emphasis on design in the new ABET accreditation requirements and is
              expected to make a significant impact in undergraduate education in engineering
              and science.
