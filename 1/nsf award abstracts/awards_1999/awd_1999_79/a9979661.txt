Abstract    :
              
The goals of our proposed project are to develop meshfree-particle methods,
              which provide: 

1. multiple length and time scales capabilities; 
2. the
              abilities to treat shear failure bands, damage evolution, fracture, crack
              growth, fragmentation, and large deformation problems; 
3. the capability to
              establish simulation-based acquisition, dramatically reducing the amount of
              live-fire testing, which is expensive and time consuming; and 

To this end,
              the following objectives will serve as milestones as well as assist in the
              accomplishment of the above stated results: 

1.   The development of an
              adaptive micro-macro material length scale bridging methodology based on
              wavelet multiresolution analysis of shear bands so that refinement can be
              introduced in areas of high gradients; and 
2.   Collaboration with DOE and
              DOD personnel for validation and refinement of the procedures by comparison
              with experimental results.
