Abstract    :
              This renewal award supports theoretical research in developing a theory for
              superconducting and normal state properties of cuprates using a
              spin-fluctuation approach.  This approach is based on fermions interacting via
              spin fluctuations that are nearly antiferromagnetic, and reduced to a model
              with three free parameters.  The current goal is to calculate within this model
              the superconducting transition temperature, Tc, as a function of doping, the
              forms of the fermionic spectram function, and the dynamical spin susceptibility
              below Tc.  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop the full theory of
              cuprates based on the spin-fluctuation model.
%%%
The high Tc superconducting
              materials start as insulating antiferromagnets before they are doped and
              transformed into metallic superconductors.  This research award will support
              continued work by the principal investigator to develop a theory for
              superconducting and normal state properties of the cuprates based on a
              spin-fluctuation approach, with the particular model developed under this
              effort attempting to describe the important materials properties of the
              cuprates with only three independent parameters.  This research is of critical
              importance in understanding the mysterious properties of the cuprates,
              including the appearance of high-temperature superconductivity upon
              doping.
