Abstract    :
              This award in the Arctic Contaminants program is supported by the Office of 
              Polar Programs, the Divisions of Chemistry and Earth Sciences, and the Math and
              Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  Dr. Ronald S.
              Sletten of the University of Washington will conduct the research in
              collaboration with Dr. Tom Pratum, also of the University of Washington, Dr.
              Steven  Grant from the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, and
              Dr. Thomas Osterkamp from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.  Together the
              research group has expertise in environmental and analytical chemistry, nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) methodology, thermodynamic modeling, and ionic
              migration in frozen soils.  The group will conduct laboratory and field studies
              and theoretical analysis of soils contaminated with ionic pollutants under
              subfreezing conditions.  Using NMR pulsed-gradient techniques, they will assess
              diffusion rates on the molecular scale. The solutes under investigation include
              lithium, sodium, lead, cadmium and zinc chlorides, and calcium sulfate.  Of
              particular interest is contaminant migration in permafrost areas, both in the
              continuously frozen subsurface and the annually thawing, surface active-layer. 
              The expected result is improved fundamental understanding of the transport and
              fate of pollutants in cold terrestrial environments underlain by permafrost.
