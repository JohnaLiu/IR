	Photochemical reactions of halogen compounds in the
              Arctic springtime atmosphere cause depletion of boundary-layer ozone,
              deposition of mercury to the arctic ecosystem, and halogen-mediated
              decomposition of organic compounds. However, key aspects of these processes are
              inadequately understood.  The Polar Sunrise Experiment-2000 (PSE-2000) is
              designed to improve understanding of springtime boundary layer halogen
              chemistry and the role of surface snow as a source and sink of photochemically
              active compounds.  Measurements and analyses of nitrogen oxides mixing ratios
              are proposed here as part of the PSE-2000 project.  NO, NO2, and NOy will be
              determined at the PSE-2000 site near Alert, Nunavut, Canada, with gradient
              measurements of NOx and ancillary measurements of the N02 photodissociation
              rate constant and spectral actinic flux.  The proposed N02 measurements will be
              used with measurements of BrO and other compounds by collaborating researchers
              to investigate the importance of these reactions to O3-depletion chemistry. 
              Analyses of the NO-NO2 photostationary state will provide further insight into
              the importance of the BrO + NO2 = BrONO2 reaction and other NOx-sink reactions.
               Measurements of the vertical gradient of NOx and analysis of expected
              post-sunrise diurnal cycles in NOx and NOy will be used to investigate the role
              of the snow surface as a source and sink for photochemically active nitrogen
              oxide compounds.
