Abstract    :
              


The objective of this proposal is to study the feasibility of delivering
              ultra-high data rates up to 1 Gbits/s to a mobile, wireless node through
              advances in the design of compact antenna arrays, modulation and error control
              coding/joint decoding techniques, and signal processing under high data rate
              and limited computing power environments. The technologies emphasized in our
              work are (1) novel design methods for patch antenna arrays, (2) recursive,
              nonlinear decoder structures that employ iterative decoding techniques similar
              to Turbo decoding, and channel estimation algorithms that utilize preliminary,
              probabilistic information from the iterative decoders, and (3) computationally
              ecient adaptation algorithms for estimating and predicting time-varying channel
              characteristics as well as steering the antenna patterns for nulling the
              signals arriving from the interfering users in a network. As part of our work,
              we propose to design and prototype a laptop system that integrates all three
              components listed above. While our studies will be more general in nature, we
              plan to use spread spectrum multiple access systems as the base technology for
              much of the experimental phase
of the work.
