This Americas Program award will support travel and related
              expenses for US scientists and students to participate in an international
              workshop on quantum symmetries in theoretical physics and mathematics to be
              held in San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina, on January 10-22, 2000.  Organizers
              are Dr. James D. Stasheff, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Dr.
              Roberto Trinchero, Centro Atomico Bariloche, Argentina, and Dr. Robert
              Coquereaux of Centre de Physique Theorique, Marseille, France.  The workshop is
              designed to introduce participants to aspects of the theory of quantum groups
              (Hopf algebras) and their applications in theoretical physics and mathematics. 
              This workshop is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs in
              the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences together with the
              Division of Physics, the Division of Mathematical Sciences, and the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences.

Symmetries in theoretical physics have long been important and
              have provided one of the major techniques for investigating the quantum realm. 
              Besides stimulating interactions between scientists, and strengthening
              international scientific collaboration, this workshop will enable US and Latin
              American scientists and students to become aware of the newer developments in
              this area of research and will help maintain cross-fertilization between the
              fields of mathematics and physics.  In addition to the US and Latin American
              participants, the workshop will also bring together leading scientists in the
              field from Europe.
