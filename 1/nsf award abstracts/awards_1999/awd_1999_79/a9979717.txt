The objective is to develop novel computational
              methods for the recently proposed virtual internal bond (VIB) method. The VIB
              method extends the application range of classical continuum mechanics to
              modeling cohesive elasticity at much smaller length scales (e.g., lattice
              spacing in elastic deformation). A major obstacle to the application of such
              theory is the lack of efficient numerical methods for higher order or nonlocal
              continuum theories involving multiple distinct materials length scales.  Here
              we plan to develop a robust and reliable numerical method to analyze multiscale
              phenomena that cannot be addressed by classical continuum theories. Our effort
              will include the development of efficient and scalable numerical methods for
              multiscale computation. We will compare the numerical results with experiments
              to validate the theory, and use the numerical method to investigate several
              fundamental problems that cannot be addressed by classical continuum
              theories.
