Abstract    :
              This project proposes a series of experimental and qualitative studies that will
              help in understanding the role of carefully designed early field experiences
              for preservice teachers, coupled with mathematics content courses, on the
              beliefs and the mathematical growth of prospective elementary teachers of
              mathematics.  The PIs propose to develop instruments that provide accurate
              measures of:
1. Beliefs of prospective teachers;
2. Prospective teachers;
              depth of understanding of the school mathematics they expect to teach;
3.
              Knowledge about what novices and experts actually attend to when observing
              teaching situations, with the understanding that this knowledge will guide the
              development of a field-based course.

The course will be evaluated using a
              quasi-experimental design employing assignment of classes of prospective
              teachers to one of three conditions.  Students in all three conditions will be
              compared as they complete their mathematics courses in subsequent semesters. 
              Related quasi-experimental studies are proposed to examine questions of timing.
               Various other data will be collected as adjuncts to the two major
              studies.

Research results will offer other universities a knowledge base in
              planning effective teacher preparation programs.
