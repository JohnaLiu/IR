Abstract    :
              This project, composed of 13 graduate students from San Diego area universities
              and 3 from Illisaguik College and the College of Barrow Alaska, is expanding
              the San Diego County PISCES Project; an ongoing, district-based,
              community-supported elementary science improvement program for grades K-6 in
              eight participating school districts.

The project is providing instruction
              to 16 fellows and at least 48 teachers annually in appropriate and effective
              learning processes for science education, facilitating science content
              knowledge transfer to cooperating teachers and enriched science curriculum
              development, and utilizing educational technology to leverage project impact. 
              Educational features include both summer and school-year on-site workshops and
              seminars for the fellows and their cooperating teachers, and extensive use of
              the San Diego County Office of Education's educational technology resources. 
              The project is developing improved communication and teaching skills for the
              fellows, providing enriched learning for K-6 students, offering professional
              development opportunities for K-6 teachers funded by the cooperating districts
              and private funds, and strengthening partnerships among science education
              stakeholders in San Diego.  The professional development instruction of the
              participating teachers is being co-funded by private sources through the San
              Diego Science Alliance and the participating school districts.

A bonus
              result of this project came from Dr. Walter Oechel's NSF Polar Programs
              environmental research program in Arctic Alaska and chaparral research in
              California, which is providing exchanges of Science Corps fellows and internet
              video and data links for use in this project.
