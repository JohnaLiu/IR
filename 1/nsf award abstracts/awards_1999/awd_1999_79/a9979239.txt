Scientists love a mystery, because solving a mystery in nature
              means the opportunity to learn something new about the universe. High-energy
              cosmic rays are just such a mystery.  Where they come from, how they get their
              energy, and how they get here is not known. The highest-energy cosmic rays have
              a hundred million times more energy than the particles produced in the world's
              most powerful particle accelerator.  Something out there -- no one knows what
              -- is hurling incredibly energetic particles around the universe. Do these
              particles come from some unknown super-powerful cosmic explosion? From a huge
              black hole sucking stars to their violent deaths?  From colliding galaxies?
              From the collapse of massive invisible relics from the origin of the
              universe?

Each second, about 200 cosmic ray particles with energies of a few
              million electron volts strike every square meter of the earth. While these
              low-energy cosmic rays are plentiful, cosmic rays at higher energies are far
              rarer. Above the energy of 10^18 eV, only one particle each week falls on an
              area of one square kilometer. Above the energy of 10^20 eV, only one particle
              falls on a square kilometer in a century! To find and measure these rare
              events, a high-energy cosmic ray study needs a truly giant detector. This is
              the instrument proposed by the Pierre Auger collaboration.

The Pierre Auger
              Project will construct two 3000 square kilometer grids of detectors spaced at
              1.5  kilometer intervals. An array in the Southern Hemisphere will attempt to
              track high-energy cosmic rays to their unknown sources.

This project is
              supported jointly by the Division of Physics and the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
              Directorate.
