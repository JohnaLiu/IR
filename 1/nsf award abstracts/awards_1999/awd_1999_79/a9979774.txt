Abstract    :
              This project will focus on developing innovative methods for analysis,
              representation and interpretation of human actions from data repositories
              containing information which describes human motion.  Analysis of human motion
              is important in many areas including kinesiology, ergonomics, anthropology,
              medical rehabilitation, creative arts such as dance, and athletic
              studies.

Using motion representations derived from related work in robotics
              and virtual reality modeling, the project will build user-friendly interfaces
              and tools which can accept various query forms, such as spatio-temporal
              specifications and other symbolic descriptors.  A second goal for the project
              is to develop robust and flexible indexing methods which can be used in
              recognition, reconstruction and retrieval of human actions from video and other
              motion databases.
