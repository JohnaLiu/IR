There is a need to extend the scientific basis for tissue
              engineering of articular cartilage for use in the replacement of arthritic
              joints. Normally, articular cartilage forms under the influence of mechanical
              load. Currently, the in vitro synthesis of cartilaginous tissue constructs from
              isolated chondrocytes is done in the absence of load, requires prolonged
              culture (for many months), and does not achieve a tissue with the composition,
              structure, and function of normal articular cartilage. The immediate aims of
              this project are to establish the feasibility of applying dynamic loading
              during construct growth in order to modulate tissue formation and of developing
              an associated theoretical framework. The specific aims are:

(1) To develop a
              method for synthesizing three-dimensional cartilaginous tissue constructs from
              isolated chondrocytes in a manner that allows application of compressive load
              at defined amplitude, frequency, and duration, and to use this method to
              evaluate construct formation with certain cell densities and loading
              conditions.

(2) To develop a simple theoretical model that describes the
              time-course of evolution of tissue composition and cumulative release into the
              medium of tissue products based on parameters that can be measured in
              short-term experiments, and to determine the sensitivity of the model to these
              parameters and the variability in the measured values.

The proposed work
              will emphasize quantitative aspects of tissue engineering. During the course of
              the study, human resources will be developed for tissue engineering through the
              training one post-doctoral fellow and one graduate student.
