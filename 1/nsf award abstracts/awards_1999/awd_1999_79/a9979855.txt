CISE Educational Innovation:
              Integrated Security Curricula Modules

This CISE Educational Innovation (EI)
              award supports the development of a set of instructional modules in computer
              security that is being integrated into undergraduate courses.  The body of
              knowledge that is included ranges from programming to ethics and is being
              threaded through several undergraduate courses rather than into a single
              monolithic course in computer security.  The project packages specific research
              efforts into small lessons, or modules, that can be easily integrated into a
              wide range of courses.  Each module is accompanied by an assessment piece and
              dissemination is accomplished by collaboration through the Web and by
              distribution of CD-ROMs that contain interactive lessons.  The PIs are
              recognized for their innovations in computer security education and the
              Information Systems Security Laboratory (of which the PIs are a part) at the
              institution that has been designated by the National Security Agency as one of
              their seven Centers of Excellence in Information Assurance Education.  This
              project complements the research support of NSF in this important area of
              computer security.
