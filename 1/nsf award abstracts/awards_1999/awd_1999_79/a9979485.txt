This Pan American Advanced Institute (PASI) award on
              Computational Materials Science (CMS), jointly supported by NSF and the U.S.
              Department of Energy (DOE), will feature a spectrum of forefront topics in this
              field.  CMS is one of the broadest, most rapidly evolving and technologically
              significant areas of science today.  From its foundations in basic science, CMS
              branches to new materials, to processing, and to the life sciences.  Due to
              rapid advances in computational capacity, including new algorithms, software
              macro-packages, and low-cost personal computers, CMS problems previously
              thought intractable are actively being pursued.  The enhanced capabilities of
              CMS increasingly have an impact on the search for new materials, the
              improvement and design of processing techniques, and research in biological
              areas such as protein folding.  This Institute is planned to be held in Peru,
              and will include senior and junior researchers from the U.S., Canada, and a
              number of South and Central American nations.
