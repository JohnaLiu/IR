MCMC Algorithms for Object Recognition

This is a standard SGER
              award.  This exploratory research is about finding clothed people in images
              with a mixture of probabilistic and geometric techniques. Current theories of
              object recognition cannot be used to recognize such complex deformable objects,
               particularly because they do not allow exact geometric models and are on
              cluttered backgrounds.  In this study, a bottom-up approach based on learning
              will be used to assemble image primitives (defined by invariant filters) into
              regions that could be clothing, and then to assemble these regions into regions
              that could be body segments, which will be assembled further into limbs, and so
              on, until a region is sufficiently large to indicate that a person is present.
              This purely bottom-up approach will be complemented by Markov chain Monte Carlo
              (MCMC) techniques to modify existing groups. The intention is to obtain cases
              that have high posterior probability. In particular, collections of segments
              that do not on their own pass assembly tests will be randomly advanced past
              those tests anyway, if the group that results has high posterior probability.
