Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the participation of 12 young academic
              researchers and 10 graduate students in the 1999 Gordon Research Conference on
              Analytical Chemistry.  The conference will be held at New England College,
              Henniker, NH on August 1-6, 1999.  The subject of the conference will be an
              attempt to define the biochemical measurement needs for the next decade.  The
              conference is multidisciplinary in nature and technologically significant.  The
              grant will be co-funded by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, the Office of Multi-disciplinary Activities of the
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Instrumentation and
              Instrument Development Program in the Biological Infrastructure and Resources
              Division of the Biological Sciences Directorate.

This award will assist
              young analytical chemists, both faculty and graduate students,  to participate
              in the 1999 Gordon Conference on Analytical Chemistry.  The research to be
              discussed in the conference sessions will be of major potential impact in a
              number of technologically important fields.
