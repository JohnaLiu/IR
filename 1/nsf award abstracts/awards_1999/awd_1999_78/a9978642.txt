Abstract    :
              This grant funds the development of a methodology for the determination of tolls
              in congested networks such as urban street networks and communication networks.
               While these examples are very different physically, the mathematical models
              used in their design and control are quite similar.  The theoretical
              development will identify all tolling strategies that make the network
              efficient, even when many individual users are allowed to make their own
              choices as in the case of urban traffic.  The computational development will
              provide robust numerical methods that calculate tolls accurately for networks
              of arbitrary size and configuration.

In transportation research dating from
              the 1950s economists have recognized the value of tolling of congested networks
              as a method of control and to provide revenues for alternative travel modes
              such as
transit.  Now technology allows for high-speed tollbooths and the U.
              S. Department of Transportation is funding several tolling experiments across
              the U. S.  However, there is no established method for determination of tolls
              in various settings.  This research will provide network designers and planners
              with tools that identify all tolls that achieve minimum system impact; and
              calculate the tolls that achieve additional objectives such as minimizing the
              number of tolling stations, minimizing costs to the users, etc.
