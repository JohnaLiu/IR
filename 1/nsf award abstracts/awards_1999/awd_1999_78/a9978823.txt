Abstract    :
              A workshop on 'Mathematical Foundations of CAD' will be held  at the
              Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, Berkeley CA, June 4-5, 1999. The
              purpose of this workshop is to bring together leading researchers from the
              fields of pure and applied mathematics, computational geometry, and
              computer-aided geometric design, to explore the fundamental unresolved
              mathematical and computational issues that currently impair the utility and
              reliability of CAD systems in scientific/engineering applications. Problems
              with the representation and manipulation of geometry in CAD systems have deep
              roots in many areas of mathematics, such as algebraic and differential
              geometry, topology, analysis, and approximation theory. 

This workshop will
              help promote discussion and interaction between the CAD and mathematics
              communities. It will be exploratory in nature, with 'position' papers used to
              stimulate debate and discussion concerning current needs, possibilities, and
              promising areas for joint exploration. The anticipated outcomes of the workshop
              will include: (1) exposing mathematicians to an interesting array of geometry
              problems motivated by practical CAD needs; (2) imparting to the CAD algorithm
              developers an idea of the current state-of-the-art in relevant mathematical
              disciplines; (3) promotion of collaborative projects between researchers in the
              CAD and mathematics communities; and (4) compilation and publication of the
              workshop findings in an appropriate forum.
