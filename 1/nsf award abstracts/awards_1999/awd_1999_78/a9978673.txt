Abstract    :
              Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP)
The University of
              Michigan
Fawwaz T. Ulaby

In the eleven years since UROP was launched to
              improve undergraduate education and minority student retention and academic
              achievement, it has evolved from serving 14 students to more than 850 first-
              and second-year students each year. The centerpiece of this innovative program
              is the creation of research partnerships between first- and second-year
              students and faculty researchers.  UROP has been successful in its mission to
              weave minority students into the fabric of the campus community at an early
              point in their academic careers.  To date, some 4,000 students have
              participated in UROP; more than 2,100 have been students of color.  Success
              indicators include an attrition rate lower than that for university-wide
              underrepresented students and a mean Grade Point Average 6% higher than that of
              students in a matched control group.
