The purpose of
              the Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics Conference is to bring
              together researchers in the areas of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
              in the midwest area of the exchange of ideas and most recent research results. 
              It is particularly designed as a platform for young researchers (graduate
              students and young faculty members) to gain confidence and experience in
              presenting and discussing their ideas and research accomplishments.

The 1999
              Conference will be held May 17-18,1999 at Wayne State University.

Early
              meetings tended to feature primarily experimental and theoretical classical
              thermodynamics.  Recent meetings have emphasized experiments, statistical
              mechanics and computer simulation; for this reason, the name of the meeting was
              lengthened to Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics in 1996.  The
              topics will continue to be emphasized.  Last year (1998), a special effort was
              made to include more experimental contributions.  The meeting is attended by
              chemical engineers, chemists, physicists, and materials scientists.
