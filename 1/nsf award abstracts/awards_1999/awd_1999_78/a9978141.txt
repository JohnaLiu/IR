Digital Government: Alliance Federal Consortium
              Program: Making the Alliance Accessible to Federal Agencies

This activity
              will support the development and delivery of a series of technology transfer
              and outreach activities by the NSF National Computational Science Alliance to
              the Federal Web Consortium, a group of Federal civilian agencies with
              significant information services mission elements.  Topics covered will include
              distance learning, high-bandwidth networking, simulation, mining and
              visualization of large datasets, and other activities.  Delivery mechanisms
              will include site visits by Alliance staff to Consortium agency sites, site
              visits by the agencies to the Alliance, remote training, videoconferencing, and
              monthly meetings hosted by NSF.  Additionally, support will be provided for the
              Alliance's Access Center, an 8,000-square feet high-tech demonstration and
              training site in Arlington, VA.
