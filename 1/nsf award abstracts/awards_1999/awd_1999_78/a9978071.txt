Abstract:
              This project involves a Special Semester at Stanford University and The
              American Institute of Mathematics bringing together a team of four senior
              investigators, two postdoctoral fellows and two advanced graduate students for
              an intense and collaborative study of essential surfaces in knot exteriors. Two
              of the senior investigators have been working on a program over the past two
              decades to detect certain knots by properties of essential surfaces in the knot
              exterior. Their methods have been very successful in identifying such
              properties but do not lead to methods that will enable one to realize such
              knots. The other two senior investigators have in the last three years
              developed new methods for realizing knots having interesting properties. This
              project will bring these two methods together to address one of the most
              outstanding problems in this area of mathematical research.

Low-dimensional
              topology brings together many areas of mathematical research and provides a
              common ground for interaction and advance across all of mathematics. It
              provides a natural geometric model of most physical phenomena. Research in this
              area is making significant contribution to computational geometry and topology
              and complexity theory. It has consequences in physics, computer visualization
              and medical modeling.
