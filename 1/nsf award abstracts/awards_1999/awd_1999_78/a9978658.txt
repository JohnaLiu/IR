This is a United Engineering Foundation international
              conference on "Processing of Fibers and Composites (Polymeric, Metallic, and
              Ceramic) to be held May 21-26, 2000 in II Ciocco, Italy.  The objective of the
              conference is to provide a unique forum for discourse on processing issues
              related to fibrous reinforcements and their composites.  The scope of this
              conference includes polymeric, metallic, and ceramic fibers and composites. The
              sessions are divided into three major categories: fibers, composites, and
              future directions in this field.  A main goal is to examine aspects of
              processing of fibers and composites with a view toward obtaining desired sets
              of properties.  In both the fibers and composites categories, there are four
              sessions.  It is expected that the participants will reach a consensus with
              regards to future directions, taking into account the interdisciplinary nature
              of the field as well as the expected changes in emphasis resulting from a past
              focus on defense-related applications to civilian applications of composites. 
              Support from the National Science Foundation enables graduate students to
              attend and provides partial support to a few distinguished
              researchers.
%%%
The field of fibers and fiber-reinforced composites has
              become very important in recent years.  It is recognized that processing is the
              key to obtaining a desired set of properties in these materials, hence the
              focus on this subject in the conference.
