	This project reanalyzes data on social networks from 18
              anthropological field sites and historical studies of sets of social
              relationships, involving a network of collaborators and students in US as well
              as foreign universities. Formal concepts such as biconnectedness - sets of
              multiply connected actors - are defined for social networks and analyzed in
              extant data sets.  For specified sets of social relations multiply connected
              sets of actors are hypothesized to have greater cohesiveness, as expressed in
              measurable behavioral criteria.  Bicomponent members are hypothesized to enjoy
              more social capital than others.  The project will train a large international
              set of collaborators to work on a coordinated set of analytical themes centered
              on the nature and impact of bicomponent network social relationships.
	The
              significance of the research is that the researchers will be able to predict
              the development of social institutions, the likeliness of social change in
              groups, the impact of divisiveness, and the fact that the project will train a
              set of researchers and advanced students in a quantitative analytic technique
              useful for a wide range of social analysis. Workshops will be convened in
              Paris, Cologne, Madrid, and possibly Mexico to develop and coordinate the
              methods.
