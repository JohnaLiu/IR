This award is to support studies of the fundamental scientific issues
              in heat conduction in thin films by lattice vibrations. Thin films and
              nanometer-scale multilayers of highly disordered materials will be prepared by
              magnetron sputtering and characterized by Rutherford backscattering
              spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and x-ray reflectivity.  Heat
              transport in these materials will be quantified using the 3-omega method in the
              temperature range 35-500 K, and longitudinal speeds of sound will be measured
              using picosecond ultrasonics.  This combination of measurements will facilitate
              a detailed comparison between the thermal conductivity data and the minimum
              thermal conductivity model.  The objective is to establish a greater
              understanding of the mechanisms that create high and low thermal conductivities
              in thin film materials with large disorder. This new knowledge is also expected
              to expand the range of thin film thermal properties that are available for
              applications.
