Abstract    :
              With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Program and the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences are supporting Dr.  Laren M. Tolbert of the School of Chemistry and
              Biochemistry at the Georgia Institute of Technology and  Dr. Isiah M. Warner of
              the Department of Chemistry at Louisiana State University.  Drs. Tolbert and
              Warner, along with Dr. Joel Shulman of the Proctor and Gamble Company, will
              organize and lead a workshop entitled "Minority Ph.D.'s in Chemistry:  What Are
              We Doing Wrong?"  The workshop, involving academic, industrial and private
              foundation leaders, will address the continuing drought of minority entry-level
              Ph.D.'s in chemistry for both industry and academia. The product of the
              workshop will be a set of recommendations for the improvement of the
              recruitment, guidance and successful development of minority Ph.D. candidates
              in chemistry.
