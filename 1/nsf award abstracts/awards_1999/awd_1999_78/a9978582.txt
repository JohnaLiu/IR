Abstract    :
              
DBI 9978582; SGER Computational Neuroscience Problems with application to
              Microarray Expression Analysis

The objective of the proposed research is to
              develop and implement computational
approaches for determining the mechanisms
              through which information is represented
and processed within neural systems.
              The project will then examine the hypothesis  that this problem is similar to
              studying gene expression patterns using DNA microarrays in order to learn about
              the underlying regulatory networks that presumably govern gene expression.
              Thus, the proposed overall intent is to adapt methods developed in the neural
              domain to analyze gene expression data from microarray experiments.
The
              premise is that the scientific problem of neural mapping and the problem of
              using DNA microarrays to understand gene regulatory networks share some
              interesting similarities. The underlying assumption is that both systems, gene
              product regulation and neural activity are governed by a control
              network-understanding in greater depth and subsequent computational modeling of
              the neural system could, when applied to the network control analogy in gene
              expression provide valuable insights and ultimately the basis of a new set of
              informatics tools designed to better analyze microarray gene expression
              data.
