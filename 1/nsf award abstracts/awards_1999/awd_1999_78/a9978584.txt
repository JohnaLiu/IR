Functionally graded materials (FGM) with 'continuous' changes
              occurring in their microstructure are useful for several electrical and
              mechanical applications.  In order to expand the usefulness of FGM in optical
              arena the materials should have graded structure-property relationship on the
              micro to nanoscale range.  In this SGER proposal the PI has suggested to use
              the nanoscale-ordering behavior of the mixed oxide materials and thus tailoring
              and grading the optoelectronic properties of this special class of materials. 
              Under special heating cycle the degree of orderedness in the material can be
              varied which consequently will also influence the optoelectronic properties of
              materials.  Several relaxor and order-disorder type materials will be tested
              for achieving the goals of the proposed research.

The idea is novel and has
              not been tested before to produce the highly useful and needed optical graded
              refractive index ceramics or single crystal materials.

The scope of the
              proposed work does fall in the new and high-risk category of research.  If it
              is successful several new applications of such materials are envisaged in the
              optoelectronic area.
