	Among terrestrial organisms, the beetles remain one of the
              poorest known major groups of animals, with species diversity already
              recognized in the tens of thousands but possibly much greater than that. Their
              ecological significance is also great, and in particular the staphylinid rove
              beetles of the subfamily Aleocharinae are thought to be major predators of soil
              nematodes and other soil microarthropods worldwide. Yet, the poor state of
              knowledge of beetle taxonomy impedes progress in general classification of
              these animals and in application and use of identification keys by ecologists,
              resource managers, and others needing reliable information and ready access to
              accurate data. Continuing a productive program of research and training in
              beetle systematics, Dr. James Ashe and colleagues at the University of Kansas
              embark on a second series of projects under the Partnerships for Enhancing
              Expertise in Taxonomy (PEET), which will include training of minimally two new
              taxonomic experts in beetle systematics; production of taxonomic monographs and
              revisions of selected groups of rove beetles; and databasing of specimen
              information, geographic distributions, morphological data, images and
              illustrations, and identification keys in web-accessible formats. Dr. Ashe also
              helps maintain the website that hosts all of the NSF-supported PEET projects,
              at the University of Kansas's Natural History Museum.
