This is a proof of concept study to test the feasibility of
              measuring ionospheric plasma density profiles using existing, low-power,
              ground-based radar.  The method utilizes the Faraday rotation of radar signals
              coherently scattered by plasma density irregularities.  Such a method
              necessitates the use of a bistatic radar system, to be composed of transmitting
              elements in Piura, Peru, and receiving and data acquisition equipment at the
              Jicamarca Radio Observatory.  Electron densities can not be made by the
              Jicamarca radar by itself because of the radar clutter generated by small-scale
              irregularities in the electrojet.  It is important to know the E-region
              electron density because its variability affects the growth rate and decay of
              plasma instabilities.  This quantity is an essential input to many models of
              the low latitude ionosphere.  If this study is successful, it will establish an
              effective means to measure equatorial plasma densities using low-power,
              ground-based instrumentation.
