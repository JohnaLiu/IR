This award supports Simon Moss, Paul Chow, Joseph Kulik, and a
              graduate student from the University of Houston in a collaboration with Hannu
              Pekka Suortti at the X-Ray Laboratory at the University of Helsinki, Finland. 
              The project will focus on establishing the existence of a Fermi surface and
              measuring its dimensions using Compton scattering from selected quasicrystals
              and related intermetallic structures.  A long-range goal is to understand the
              transport and electronic properties of complex conductors which can eventually
              include metallic glasses, conducting oxides, and magnetic materials.  The
              collaboration draws on the individual expertise of researchers in the fields of
              quasicrystals (U. of Houston, Ames Laboratory, and City College of New York)
              and Compton scattering (U. of Helsinki).  The overall scientific benefit of the
              collaboration to the research community will be to provide important
              information on alloy physics which would be difficult for any individual group
              to collect and analyze due to the complicated nature of quasicrystals and the
              sophisticated techniques required for high-energy Compton scattering.
