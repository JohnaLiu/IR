Abstract    :
              Support is provided for the symposium and workshop:  "Extremophile Research:
              Theory and Techniques" under the auspices of George Mason University's
              Institute for Bioscience, Bioinformatics, and Biotechnology and the Center of
              Marine Biotechnology (COMB), University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute.
              The four-day course is being held at COMB facilities at the Columbus Center,
              Baltimore, MD, during the summer of 1999. "Extremophile Research: Theory and
              Techniques" includes a one-day symposium and a three-day intensive laboratory
              workshop. The symposium brings experts from various areas of extremophile
              research to discuss the current state of knowledge on growth, biochemistry and
              genetics of extremely anaerobic methanogens, hyperthermophiles and extreme
              halophiles. The laboratory sessions include lectures and blocks of
              demonstration and hands-on experiments focussing on specialized techniques used
              to study these groups of organisms.  Support is being provided for graduate
              students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from small colleges and
              universities.  Participation in this course should increase the number of
              researchers studying microbes with unusual growth properties, some of which
              contain genes for enzymes and products of application to biotechnology.
