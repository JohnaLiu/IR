Abstract    :
               
The conference has been organized to bring together the industrial and
              university photonics community to discuss issues on Optoelectronoc Assembly,
              Packaging and Manufacturing.  The workshop will be held in Vail, Colorado,
              Sepltember 15 to 17, 1999. The goal of the workshop is to develop up-to-date
              requirements for assembly, packaging, and manufacurturing technologies for next
              generation fiber-optics, optoelectronics and photonic components and
              systems.

Invited and contributed presentations will include application of
              MEM technologies, new materials, automation, optical micro-bench, thermal
              management, VCSEL arrays, WDM components, diffractive optical elements,
              micro-filter, etc.  Students will benefit by presenting their research results
              in the workshop, interacting with industries, and having an opportunity to seek
              future employment.  The NSF funds will be used to support student travel to the
              conference.
