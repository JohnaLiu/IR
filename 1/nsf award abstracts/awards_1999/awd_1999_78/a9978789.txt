The goal of this project is to develop a design methodology for
              selection and processing of application specific wear resistant coatings. 
              Finite element modeling of the contact mechanics of nano-structured multi-layer
              films on compliant substrates will be used in combination with experimental
              studies to develop specific control techniques.  These will allow deposition of
              strongly adherent hard coatings with properties that are specific to selected
              applications.  The control techniques will be based on the physical quantities
              that control coating chemistry and microstructure, such as ion and atom fluxes
              and substrate temperature, combined with real-time in situ process monitoring
              and coating analysis.  Initial work will focus on CrN based multi-layers for
              hard chrome replacement.  Later, ternary transition metal nitrides and tailored
              multi-layer and graded-layer nano-structured coatings will be studied.
