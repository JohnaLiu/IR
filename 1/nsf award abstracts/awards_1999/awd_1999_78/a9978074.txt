This theoretical research involves several topics brought
              together by an overarching theme of understanding condensed phase systems
              exhibiting strong electron correlations.   In particular, investigations are
              unified by their connections with quantum systems in the vicinity of zero
              temperature continuous phase transitions.  These quantum critical points can be
              studied using generalizations of scaling and renormalization ideas developed in
              classical critical phenomena. Topics to be studied include nonlinear electrical
              response near quantum critical points in charged systems; dynamics near avoided
              critical points; and studies of possible quantum phases and phase transitions
              in quantum Hall and other strongly correlated systems.

This grant supports
              theoretical research in strongly interacting electron systems.  Although simple
              quasi-particle approximations have been very successful in describing materials
              properties, many other materials such as quantum Hall systems, cuprates, and
              heavy fermion systems are not well described by these models which assume weak
              electron corrrelations.  The research in this grant will study novel strongly
              correlated electron systems near a "quantum phase transition."  Strongly
              correlated systems in this regime can be treated using many of the same
              tecniques which have been applied so successfully to classical thermal critical
              phenomena.
