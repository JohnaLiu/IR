Abstract    :
              Over the next five years North Carolina State University and North Carolina A&T
              State University will triple their numbers of doctoral students prepared for
              faculty careers in science, math and engineering (SME). The North Carolina
              Minority Graduate Education Partnership is a comprehensive recruitment and
              mentoring initiative designed to change institutional cultures as it develops
              interest in SME research, and particularly in academic careers, among
              underrepresented minority students from their junior undergraduate year through
              completion of doctoral education. Components include intensive faculty-mentored
              research experiences for minority NC State University SME undergraduate
              students and for students from NCAMP colleges. NC A&T will identify and recruit
              NCAMP students to participate in STAR, a transition and retention program for
              graduate students. Special cluster groups will tackle graduate problem solving
              and career exploration. Both universities will offer mentored training programs
              to prepare selected SME doctoral students for future faculty positions. The
              partner universities will jointly offer research training and student
              development seminars throughout each year. NC State University will launch a
              training program for participating faculty designed to develop skills in
              mentoring diverse populations; a seminar series open to all graduate students
              and faculty will focus on themes of inclusiveness and issues of diversity.
