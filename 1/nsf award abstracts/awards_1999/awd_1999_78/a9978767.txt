Abstract    :
              The durability of concrete structures is strongly affected by formation or
              decomposition and reformation of hydrated calcium aluminosulfate compounds,
              such as ettringite.  The changes are caused by environmental factors, such as
              humidity, temperature, and the presence of sulfates and carbonates.  The goal
              of this study is to determine the nature of the compound crystal structure
              changes with environmental variables and to determine the dynamics of water as
              a crystal-chemical structural member.  

Neutron diffraction and NMR studies
              of compound structure will be combined with X-ray and TGA measurements to
              examine the formation and decomposition of the cement hydration compounds and
              to elucidate the effects of relative humidity, and of sulfate, silicate, and
              carbonate concentrations on compound structure.  Of particular interest will be
              the orientation of the water in the hydrated molecules, its dependence on
              environmental factors, the dynamics of the structural water and the effects of
              its relatively easy ingress and egress on the migration of other impurities in
              the system.  This will lead to better understanding and control of the
              deterioration of concrete structures due to environmental attack.
