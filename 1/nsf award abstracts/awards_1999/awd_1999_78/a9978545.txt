This award supports a workshop entitled, "Research in Sedimentary
              Geology: Directions for the 21st Century."  The goal of the workshop is to
              outline research trends for the discipline, and to highlight their societal
              value.  The product of the workshop will be a framework document that provides
              valuable input to guiding the national effort in sedimentary geology, and that
              will be made widely available to the profession.  The workshop is designed
              around 5 themes, which are: 1) humanity, geosphere and hydrosphere:  critical
              interfaces; 2) quantitative geometry and timing of sedimentary deposits for
              human benefit; 3) Precambrian world and origin of life; 4) spatial variability
              of diagenetic products and pore-fluid composition and ; 5) quantitative 3-D
              modeling of sedimentary systems.
