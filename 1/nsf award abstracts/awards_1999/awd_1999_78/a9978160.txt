Abstract    :
              This grant provides funds for a flow cytometer that would be used by several
              investigators for research and educational activities. The Principal
              Investigators present a cohesive set of studies that bridge several
              disciplines.  These studies explore several important questions in cancer
              biology, molecular biology, and gene 
therapy by using a flow cytometer/sorter
              to complement current experimental techniques.  The projects involve studying
              areas of cell-cell adhesion, cell signaling and cycling, gene regulation,
              protein production and expression, and drug/gene delivery.
