ABSTRACT

Excessive levels of floor vibrations due to human
              activities such as walkhg, jumping, and dancing have been the topic of several
              research studies. Unfortunately, there has only been a limited success in
              finding corrective measures to this problem.

This study- investigates the
              effectiveness of magneto-rheological (MR) devices such as MR dampers, and TVA's
              for reducing floor vibrations. Methodologies and guidelines will be developed
              for the design of these devices based on the dynamic characteristics of
              different floor systems. A floor test will be constructed at the Virginia Tech
              Structures and Materials Research Laboratory and a series of dynamic tests will
              be performed to provide experimental verifications of the analvtical
              results.

Several industries will cooperate and provide technical and
              financial assistance to the project principal investigators. This study will be
              performed by the Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Architecture
              Departments of Virginia
