Abstract    :
              This project  is to develop a new database, designated AtIR, that will provide
              public electronic access to all public information pertaining to, and derived
              from, the Arabidopsis genome project. AtIR will be the next generation of a
              product formerly known as AtDB. The stated goal of the project is to facilitate
              utilization by the scientific community of the genomic resources available in
              Arabidopsis. The design anticipates the completion of the Arabidopsis genome
              sequence, widespread use of high density DNA microarrays for studies of gene
              expression and other emerging genetic technologies. In addition, relevant
              information from the approximately 9000 papers published on Arabidopsis will be
              entered into the database and associated with genome-related information.
              Because of the importance of Arabidopsis as a model for all higher plants, a
              fundamental design feature of AtIR will be ease of access by scientists who do
              not have a primary research interest in Arabidopsis. For similar reasons, the
              database design and implementation will attempt to maximize communication of
              AtIR with other databases. The database will be managed as a public resource by
              an executive committee with representatives from four institutions, and will be
              overseen by both advisory bodies and user focus groups.
