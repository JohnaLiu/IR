Abstract    :
              Organisms live in changing environments.  One means of adapting to these
              environments is through phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a single genotype
              to give rise to multiple phenotypes.  This ability reflects the interaction of
              the individual's generic and developmental systems with environment.  An
              interdisciplinary research project to study the phenotypic plasticity of
              reproduction in grasshoppers (Romalea guttata and Taeniopoda eques) is
              described.  The research will investigate the molecular and physiological
              mechanisms, and the ecological correlates of plasticity and will provide
              understanding of reproductive plasticity across different levels of
              organization.
