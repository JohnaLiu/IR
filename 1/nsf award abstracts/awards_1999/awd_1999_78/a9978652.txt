This U.S.-Mexico award will support a planning meeting
              involving 12 U.S. scientists, under the coordination of George Jiracek of San
              Diego State University, with 16 Mexican researchers, coordinated on the Mexican
              side by Enrique Gomez Trevino of the Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de
              Educacion Superior de Ensenada (CICESE), to develop an integrated 3-year,
              multi-disciplinary, geophysical/geological study of the Baja California-Gulf of
              California plate margin.  The binational study would investigate important
              evolutionary processes at this active margin, using a unique combination of
              offshore and onshore methods, including active and passive seismic surveys,
              magnetotelluric soundings, and geologic mapping. The results would contribute
              to the understanding of present and past evolution of continental margins
              globally.
