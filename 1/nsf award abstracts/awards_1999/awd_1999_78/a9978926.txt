Fundamental understanding and modeling of the "laser
              ablation of microparticles" process and the extension of the process to the
              collection of unagglomerated nanoparticles on dry or wet surfaces is proposed. 
              Nanoparticles of 5 to15 nm with narrow size distribution composed of various
              materials can be obtained with the suggested approach at large production
              rates.  Modeling and experimental investigation will focus on nanoparticle
              nucleation and growth process, evaporation of materials by laser ablation,
              chemical changes in nanoparticles by varying the surrounding gas, and in situ
              particle size electrostatic selection.  This is a multidisciplinary
              collaborative university-industry project (GOALI) between the University of
              Texas at Austin and DuPont Polymer and Electronic Materials Co. for the
              generation, characterization and use of nanoparticles with immediate
              application for thick film pastes.  If successful, the research will advance
              understanding of ablation and nucleation processes, and will have application
              to generation of new materials and structures of importance in electronics,
              sensors and optical devices.
