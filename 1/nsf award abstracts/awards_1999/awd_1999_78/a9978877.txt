Abstract    :
              Wavelets are useful in selected applications, for example in data compression,
              but not for others. This lectures series deals with alternative methods when
              classical methods fail to meet expectations.  Alternatives use transform
              methods with adaptive time-frequency bases, edgelets, ridgelets, and orthogonal
              curvelet bases to create statistical feature extractors, estimators, and
              denoisers.  Problems characteristically suffering from the curse of
              dimensionality in statistics, image analysis, and neuro-computing are treated
              from a unified approach. In addition problems in harmonic analysis are covered
              including oscillatory integrals, Bochner-Riesz summability, propagation of
              singularities, tomography with Radon-transform tools, and nonlinear
              Littlewood-Paley analysis.  The analysis of all problems supports fast
              transforms and algorithms. Finally, a concluding lecture will be devoted to
              open problems and directions for future research.
