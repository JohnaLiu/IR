This dissertation-enhancement award supports Donald Janssen's
              graduate student Erika Holt, from the University of Washington, to spend a year
              at the Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT) in Helsinki.  In the civil
              engineering and construction field it is increasingly important to provide
              materials which can withstand severe physical and environmental loads.  As a
              primary building material, concrete has been continually improved to meet
              design challenges.  This work is a continuation of previous studies pursued
              jointly by the VTT and U. Washington which provide experience with advanced
              material compositions in harsh environments.  The work is best done in Finnish
              laboratories because of the interaction between the concrete industry and
              researchers, the unique testing facilities, and the availability of
              environmental simulations.
