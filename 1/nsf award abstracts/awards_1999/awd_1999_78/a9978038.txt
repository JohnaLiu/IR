Digital Government: 
              Planning Grant for Research into the Use of Internet-based Intelligent Systems
              for Shaping and Enhancing Citizen Participation and Service Delivery

 
              Increasingly government at all levels is beginning to provide on-line services
              to the citizenry, and to collaborate and interact in a broader way with
              citizens, in areas such as public comments on proposed regulations. 
              Particularly at the local level, government can be found hosting interactive
              discussion sites, for example, New models of government-citizen interaction are
              arising;  this grant will begin to systematically explore issues such as
              equity, effectiveness, and cost of service, citizen influence, appropriate
              feedback mechanisms, and administrative, technical, and policy barriers.  Key
              activities will include a survey and a subsequent workshop to assess the
              results.
