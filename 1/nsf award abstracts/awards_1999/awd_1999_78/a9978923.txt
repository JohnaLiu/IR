Abstract    :
                   This grant provides funding for tile development of diagnostic tools for
              multi-agent systems. Specifically, this research will develop methods to
              evaluate rationality, convergence and op-timality of the social preference or
              group objective given the preferences, local goals and interaction mechanisms
              of individual agents. The developed tools will identify conditions under which
              the rationality, convergence and desired solution quality requirements are not
              satisfied by the multi-agent system. The methods will be tested in the context
              of engineering design decision making. The tools will be made available to the
              research community, via the WWW, to validate existing or planned agent-based
              applications.
     If successful, the results of this research will improve
              the performance and reliability of agent-based solutions for the control arid
              coordination of complex systems. The primary goal of this research is to
              develop methods for answering fundamental questions about the validity and
              quality of decisions made by distributed decision-makers. Identifying
              conditions under which multi-agent systems produce acceptable results will help
              to determine appropriate application areas for agent-based solutions.
