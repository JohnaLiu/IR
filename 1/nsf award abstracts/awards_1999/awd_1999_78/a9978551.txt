D. Pullin, California Institute of Technology

It is
              widely accepted that LES (Large Eddy Simulation) modeling of turbulent flows
              represents the most viable path forward to address the need to enable CFD
              methods to address these technologically and naturally occurring flow fields. 
              It is also, however, recognized that significant developments must occur for
              these methods (very likely with significant modifications from their present
              structure) to fulfill their promise.   The proposed study by Pullin will
              advance an approach to modeling the subgrid stress field that is, in principle,
              more directly related to the important physical attributes of the subgrid flow
              than other, more commonly utilized, models.

It is expected that this support
              will contribute significantly to the development of LES models and it will lead
              to the preparation of current graduate students who can continue these
              important efforts.
