Abstract    :
              MINORITY GRADUATE EDUCATION PROGRAM PROPOSAL ABSTRACT

The Minority Graduate
              Education Project at the University of the North Carolina at Chapel Hill
will
              have three major purposes: To further enhance the education and production of
              underrepresented minority Ph.D. recipients from UNC-CH science and math
              graduate programs. To expand an undergraduate component to increase  the
              participation of UNC-CH minority undergraduate students in research with UNC-CH
              science and math faculty members and encourage those students to pursue
              graduate studies in those discipline.
To expand the summer research program to
              support fulltime summer research for undergraduate students, and prospective
              graduate students, primarily from other institutions to work with U NC-CH
              science and math faculty members.  	Although UNC-CH has a very positive history
              in enrolling and graduating minority graduate students, the MGE project will
              serve as a catalyst to create an even more supportive culture and will:
              initiate support for an increased number of underrepresented graduate minority
              students entering science and math Ph.D. programs at UNC-CH; provide support
              for in-depth research experiences in the science and math for underrepresented
              minority undergraduate students at UNC-CH; and provide support for in-depth
              summer research experiences in science and math at UNC-CH for underrepresented
              minority undergraduate students.
