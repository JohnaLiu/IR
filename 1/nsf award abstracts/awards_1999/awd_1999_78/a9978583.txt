This project proposes to continue
              the assessment of potential climate change impact on California as one regional
              component of the ongoing U.S. National Assessment on the consequences of
              climate variability and change.  The proposal focuses on several sectors
              including urban and water systems, coastal effects, agriculture, and
              ecosystems.  It proposes to coordinate existing efforts of modeling, impact
              assessment, and outreach currently being performed.  Using this information,
              the proposal will extend the analysis done under a prior award to provide
              immediate input to the National Assessment process, particularly in the sectors
              noted above, and will result in a regional report on the impact of global
              change on these sectors in California.
