Abstract: Gradient theory,
              i.e. a theory equipped with an internal length in the form of higher-order
              gradients for the constitutive variables, has been introduced by Aifantis and
              co-workers in the early 1980's in order to address the problem of dislocation
              patterning, to provide estimates of shear band thickness, and to settle the
              issue of mesh-size dependence in finite element calculations in the strain
              softening regime. An additional problem that was possible to address within the
              setting of gradient theory was concerned with the bridging of length scales by
              providing a mechanism for capturing the occurrence of material instabilities at
              the microscale and investigating their effect on the macroscopic response.
              Various authors have made significant contributions on the subject along the
              original second-order "symmetric stress" theory mentioned above (e.g. Zbib,
              Muhlhaus, Vardoulakis, de Borst, Tomita, etc.) or along the first-order
              "asymmetric stress" theory introduced by Fleck and Hutchinson in the early
              1990's (e.g. Shu, Stolken, Huang, Gao, Nix, etc.). The main objective of this
              project is to revisit previously employed gradient models of elasticity,
              dislocation dynamics, and plasticity with respect to their physical origin, the
              nature of the gradient coefficients, and the form of the pertinent boundary
              conditions. A comparison between the aforementioned "symmetric stress" strain
              gradient theory and the "asymmetric stress" strain gradient theory on all these
              aspects will be provided and an assessment will be made on their advantages and
              shortcomings. Particular examples selected for this comparison will be simple
              shear / pure bending configurations, nanoidentation problems, and solid
              interfaces.
