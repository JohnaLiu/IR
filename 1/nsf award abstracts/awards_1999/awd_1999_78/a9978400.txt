Faculty and graduate students in the Department of Applied
              Mathematics at the University of Washington, Seattle are conducting a
              comparative study of middle school instructional materials in mathematics. 
              Specifically, a thorough examination of three sets of materials at grade levels
              6,7, and 8 is underway.  The goal is to do the research needed to compare
              materials used in Singapore with texts widely used at these grade levels in
              this country and with a set of middle school materials recently developed with
              NSF support.   Particular attention is given to the mathematics topics treated,
              the level and sophistication of the treatment, the degree to which the various
              topics appear as strands in the curriculum, and the degree to which closure is
              applied at various points in the materials.  Applications of mathematics and
              the contexts in which the mathematics topics are presented are also
              investigated.
