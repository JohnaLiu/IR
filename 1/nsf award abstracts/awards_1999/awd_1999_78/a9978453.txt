Abstract    :
              Children grow up in a many-layered environment that includes their families,
              their schools, and their communities. This research will investigate how
              communities and families affect the academic achievement, aggressive behavior,
              and depressed feeling of boys and girls during the time that they are in
              elementary and middle school. Current behavioral research has suggested that
              child growth and development is affected by community capital (the economic
              health and vitality of a neighborhood), social capital (the interaction among
              the residents and institutions of a neighborhood), and human capital
              (individual and family access to education and good jobs). This project will
              look at these three forms of capital to try to discern just what role each
              plays in the shaping of children, and how they may affect boys and girls
              differently.

The study will utilize a wide range of data that have already
              been collected: (1) 1990 U.S. census data, which provide measures of social and
              demographic characteristics of neighborhoods; (2) crime data to measure levels
              of violence within neighborhoods; and (3) data collected by the Prevention
              Program of Johns Hopkins University on 2000 children and their care-takers. The
              statistical procedures to be used will range from simple descriptive statistics
              and cross-tabulations to structural equation and latent growth modeling in
              order to understand the complex effects of neighborhood and family
              characteristics on how children learn and develop while they are in grades one
              through seven.
