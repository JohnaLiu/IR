This award provides funding from the
              Engineering Research Centers (ERC) Program to the self-sustaining NSF ERC
              called the Institute for Systems Research (ISR) at the University of Maryland,
              College Park, and the NSF/SRC ERC for Environmentally- Benign Semiconductor
              Manufacturing (CEBSM) at the University of Arizona, Tucson, to jointly develop
              a portfolio of interactive, computer-based simulator learning modules to
              support education in the design for environment (DFE).   These modules will be
              developed by application domain experts at CEBSM and software and cognitive
              science developers of simulator-based learning systems at ISR.   The modules
              will incorporate existing simulator codes developed by CEBSM as a part of their
              research program in areas such as water purification, water usage in wafer
              rinsing, and the water recycle process.  Students will be able simulate an
              entire system as well as explore the design of subsystems.    The modules will
              incorporate components that are appropriate for learning at the high school,
              undergraduate and graduate levels and by practicing engineers and scientists.  
              The modules will be evaluated at various educational levels, including testing
              by industry experts, and disseminated among the CEBSM institutions.
