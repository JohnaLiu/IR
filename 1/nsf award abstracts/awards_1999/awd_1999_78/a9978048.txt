Liquids, whose
              rheological properties can be significantly modified by the application of an
              electro-magnetic field, would find a wide range of important technological
              applications.  The work of the PI shows promise to achieve such properties in
              his "FIRST Fluids".

The recommended support will provide the
              bridge-financing that is expected to show that the FIRST Fluids should be
              further developed or that their promise is not likely to be realized.  A one
              year program is recommended.
