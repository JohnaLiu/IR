This  project will investigate new algorithms for training
              Support Vector Machines based on Interior Point Methods (IPMs). Training a
              Support Vector Machine (SVM) requires the solution of a very large quadratic
              programming (QP) optimization problem. The PI will break this large QP problem
              into a series of smallest possible QP subproblems by exploiting the special
              structure of the problem. IPMs will be used for the solution of the resulting
              QP subproblems. The objective is to handle very large training sets for
              analyzing massive data.         

There several classes of IPMs from which to
              choose to solve the QP
subproblems.   The PI will use potential reduction and
              column generation methods.
Investigation of the special structure of the SVM
              QP problem will be examined by using decomposition techniques of mathematical
              programming.

The proposed project is multidisciplinary, integrating state of
              the art techniques of mathematical programming and machine learning to solve
              large scale data mining problems with applications to meteorology, seismology,
              high energy physics, astronomy, finance and credit card fraud. It will have a
              significant effect on infrastructure of science and engineering since it
              presents a new approach for training large scale SVMs.
