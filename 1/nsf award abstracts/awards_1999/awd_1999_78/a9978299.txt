Abstract    :
              This award supports the Global Emissions Inventory Activity (GEIA) which is a
              crosscutting activity of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC)
              project.  The GEIA center coordinates the user and developer groups, provides
              effective distribution of GEIA data bases and related information, and manages
              the GEIA web site, which is the hub of GEIA information exchange and data base
              distribution.  Additional activities include outreach and the initiation of new
              inventory activities.
