The use of glass fiber reinforced plastic
              (GFRP) materials in structural applications is in its infancy These materials
              offer substantial benefits over traditional materials be-cause of their
              excellent durability characteristics and flexible manufacturability, How. ever,
              they remain uncompetitive with traditional materials for many application
              be-cause of the poor engineering performance of connections. The development of
              connections suited to the particular characteristics of this material is
              essential to the economic use of GRFP as a structural material. This research
              is aimed at such a devel-opment, and, consequently, could have a great impact
              on the evolution of this material in structural applications.

The objectives
              of this project are: ( 1) Design joints for use in moment resisting frames made
              from pultruded GFRP members. (2) Develop efficient manufacturing processes for
              these joints. (8) Test the joints under static loads in a frame and
              individually under cyclic, quasi-static loadings, (4) Produce simplified
              analytical models of the joints that can be used to design framed structures.
