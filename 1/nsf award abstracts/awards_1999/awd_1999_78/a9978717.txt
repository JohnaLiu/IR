Abstract    :
              Recommender systems have emerged as a practical tool for helping users alleviate
              information overload.  Early systems served close-knit communities, but
              required substantial effort from the users.  Later systems evolved to serve
              many users at low effort, but hid the recommendation mechanism and left the
              users anonymous to each other. This project restores balance between community
              and understandable processes, on the one hand, and serving larger populations
              with less effort, on the other.  In doing so, it explores how the design of
              recommender systems affects their value to users. The project explores three
              types of questions by developing and studying new interfaces in the context of
              an existing recommender system.  First, it examines interfaces that increase
              user control or understanding (e.g., explanations and user-controlled
              recommendations).  Second it looks as interfaces that foster community (e.g.,
              persistent identities and text reviews).  Finally it assesses user behavior
              when provided with interfaces to select their own communities.  This project
              results in a better understanding of how users interact in on-line communities
              built around information filtering needs.  The knowledge gained will be useful
              to designers of filtering systems and on-line communities as they strive to
              better address information overload through on-line collaboration.
