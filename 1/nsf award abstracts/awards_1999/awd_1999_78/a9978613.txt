Abstract    :
              Blue crabs play a key role in regulating shallow water communities and support
              one of the most important fisheries along the eastern coast of the United
              States.  Juveniles represent a critical stage in blue crab life history and are
              dependent on nursery habitats for survival.  Work recently conducted indicates
              that one potentially important nursery habitat includes low salinity areas of
              estuaries.  These areas may provide a benefit of lower predation rates. 
              However, the osmoregulatory demands associated with living in low salinity may
              also produce energetic costs that may have consequences for growth and
              survival.  The potential benefits of using low salinity habitats through a
              combination of distribution and tethering studies will be tested.  Potential
              for osmoregulation, relative energetic costs associated with osmoregulation and
              consequences for juvenile growth will be assessed through physiological,
              molecular and microscopy approaches.  The results of this research will have
              implications not only for understanding the life history dynamics trade-offs in
              other estuarine crustaceans.  The proposed research will rely heavily on
              undergraduate involvement and will aid in establishing a research methods
              course sequence.
