Abstract    :
              Significant changes in the atmosphere, the oceans, and the terrestrial
              environment and biota in the Arctic have been seen over the past several
              decades. A workshop had previously convened (October 1997) to describe current
              observations regarding to these changes.  Based on the report from that
              workshop, the scientific steering committees of the Arctic System Science
              program and the Ocean Atmosphere Ice Interactions program recommended the
              development a science plan. Under this award, a scientific steering committee
              for the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) will plan a study of
              Arctic environmental change and will interact with the scientific community in
              part through a workshop.  The SEARCH steering committee will complete a science
              plan that will describe the approach needed to study and to assess the causes,
              rates, and environmental significance of these Arctic changes.
