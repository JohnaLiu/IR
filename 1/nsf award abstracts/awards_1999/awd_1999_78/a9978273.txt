The project provides partial support for graduate students and
              young physicists to participate in the Sixth International Conference on
              Materials and Mechanisms of Superconductivity-High Temperature Superconductors
              to be held February 20-25, 2000, in Houston, Texas. High temperature
              superconductivity has posed an unparalleled challenge to scientists and has
              offered great promise to technologists. In spite of the impressive progress
              made in high temperature superconductivity science and technology in the last
              13 years, a comprehensive microscopic theory is yet to be developed and viable
              commercialization remains beyond reach. The Conference will bring together
              members of the international superconductivity community to focus on insights
              into the physics, materials and devices of superconductors, with a projection
              to the emerging and future research areas in superconductivity and related
              science and devices. All major superconductivity and related topics will be
              covered. The Conference is the largest international event on
              super-conductivity and is held every two to three years. Ample time will be
              made available for close interaction between participants, and between veteran
              and young researchers, in particular. It is strongly believed that
              cross-fertilization between various subdomains of superconductivity and related
              research resulting from the close interaction among participants at the
              Conference will accelerate the development of superconductivity science and
              technology.

The support provided by this project will enhance the
              opportunity for graduate students and young scientists to attend the Sixth
              International Conference on Materials and Mechanisms of Superconductivity-High
              Temperature Superconductors to be held, February 20-25, 2000, in Houston,
              Texas. The Conference is the largest international event on superconductivity
              held every two-three years with the expected attendance of about 1500 for this
              coming event. High temperature superconductivity has been proposed by some to
              be one of the critical technologies of the 21st century. The training of young
              researchers in this area is very important to maintaining the US in a prominent
              position in the future development of high temperature superconductivity
              science and technology.
