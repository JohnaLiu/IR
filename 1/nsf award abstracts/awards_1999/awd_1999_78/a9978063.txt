Abstract    :
              
This project will extend global visual display techniques with local
              visualization
methods, which combine graphics with haptic (force feedback)
              displays in three areas:

1.	Allow users to apply well-known local techniques
              (e.g. streamlines or
	releasing colored dyes) within a globally visualized
              display (created by line integral
	convolution (LIC), volume rendering, or
              feature extraction).
2.	Develop haptic interfaces to complement the local
              visual methods for
	representing vector fields. These interfaces will be
              tested and compared with each other and with                 visual
              methods.
3.	Integrate haptic and visual algorithms into a computational
              steering environment. This will allow                 for fast feedback upon
              changing visualization parameters, such as the location of a 3D, stream line   
                           advection widget or the method of haptic interaction.

The
              project will use a co-registered, semi-immersive environment consisting of a
              Fakespace Immersive Workbench and a large SenseAble Phantom 3.0 haptic device;
              other haptic devices may be added later. By co-registering haptics in the
              semi-immersive workspace, the user will have the ability to both see and feel
              the field under study.
