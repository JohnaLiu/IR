Abstract    :
              Collaborative learning often leads to better learning than learning alone. One
              distinct reason for its effectiveness could be that collaboration enables
              people to learn and integrate different ideas and perspectives, which then
              predicts that collaboration among children with different background knowledge
              will be more fruitful than collaboration among children with same or similar
              background knowledge. This project will explore what kind of and how much
              difference in prior knowledge is needed to ensure a fruitful collaboration. The
              focus of the project is on developing (and pilot telling) materials that will
              be used in a future study which will examine directly whether collaboration
              among children with different prior knowledge is ironed more conducive to the
              creation of new knowledge than collaboration among children with same prior
              knowledge. It is expected that upon the completion of this project, we will be
              in a better postion to address the effect of prior knowledge on collaboration.
