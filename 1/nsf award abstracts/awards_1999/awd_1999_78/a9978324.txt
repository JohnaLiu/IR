The North Carolina Science Teacher Institute (NCSTI) is a
              complimentary expansion of the successful South Florida Science Teacher
              Institute initiated in Miami, Florida in the summer of 1998.  This geoscience
              education program provides an innovative approach to science teacher
              professional development focused on geoscience education and technology
              training in coastal marine environments.  The institute proposes to improve the
              quality of geoscience education by offering North Carolina middle and high
              school teachers geoscience content, laboratory, field, and technology training
              in coastal themes relating to barrier island systems, meteorology,
              hydrogeology, nearshore environments, and marine biotoxins.  The 1999 Institute
              will build closer relationships between K-12 education, universities, business,
              industry, government, and community partners in both North Carolina and
              Florida.  The participation of these partners will play a fundamental role in
              bringing about widespread science educational reform in the local schools.  The
              objectives of the proposed North Carolina Science Teacher Institute compliment
              the priorities and recommendations of the National Science Foundation's
              Directorate for Geosciences (GEO), the Geoscience Education Working Group
              Report (1996), the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996), and the
              North Carolina Science Education Standards.  The primary Objectives of the
              program are to develop a stronger teaching force to improve the knowledge,
              understanding, appreciation, and implementation of geoscience content and
              technology at the middle and high school level, and to promote long-term
              collaborations between university research and K-12 education, as well as,
              local government agencies, businesses, industries and the community in an
              effort to keep the K-12 education abreast of the rapid advances in science and
              technology.  The expansion of this Institution to other coastal states offers
              an innovative approach in changing, developing, and strengthening partnerships
              between research and education throughout the nation.  The Institute also
              provides teachers innovative approaches to geoscience knowledge and problem
              solving skills through a combination of research and technology-based learning
              tools.
