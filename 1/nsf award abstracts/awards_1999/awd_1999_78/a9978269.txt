Drs. Ward and Canup
              will investigate the stability of planets against large changes in obliquity
              which would dramatically affect seasons, climate, and planetary habitability. 
              A variety of planetary system architectures will be considered, and the role of
              a large satellite in stabilizing a planet's obliquity will be explored.  An
              emphasis will be placed on planets that also occupy the habitable zone around a
              star.  They will investigate the sensitivity of planetary stability to a
              variety of planetary system architectures, their selection of which will be
              guided by results from modeling planetary formation and recent discoveries of
              extrasolar planetary systems.
