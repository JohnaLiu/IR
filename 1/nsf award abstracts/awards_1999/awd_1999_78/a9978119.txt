Abstract    :
              9978119 Bieler
Bivalvia (= Lamellibranchia, Pelecypoda) is a group of great
              living and fossil diversity, and one of immense economic importance.  There are
              few biologists specializing in investigating bivalve diversity and the largest
              (and ecologically as well as economically most important) bivalves have
              remained among the least understood.  In a joint program involving biologists
              and laboratories from the around the world, R. Bieler, a molluscan systematist
              at the Field Museum of Natural History and P. M. Mikkelsen, a molluscan
              systematist at the American Museum of Natural History, combine their expertise
              to train a new generation of bivalve workers and significantly to advance the
              systematics of the group.  The research will concentrate on the marine family
              Veneridae, a group of bivalves with more than 500 living species that form a
              key component in the world's clam fisheries.  The project will train students
              at the graduate and postdoctoral levels and involves a wide range of approaches
              and techniques ranging from field collecting and comparative anatomical studies
              to DNA sequencing.  Other educational efforts will target undergraduate
              trainees and various audiences that can be reached through web publications and
              museum programming.  Promoting bivalve research worldwide is an important goal
              of this project.  To make information about the species and associated data
              available to specialists and non-specialists alike, various bivalve databases,
              images, and keys will be developed for electronic web dissemination.
