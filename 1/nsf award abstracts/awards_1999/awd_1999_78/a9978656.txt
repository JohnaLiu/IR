Abstract    :
              This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research
              project will address the challenges of producing polymer fibers with desired
              microstructures by investigating the relationship between the processing
              parameters and the mechanical and physical properties of the fibers.   The
              production of a semicrystalline microstructure is dictated by the processing
              conditions, such as the take-up speed and the draw ratio in the fiber spinning
              process. The current understanding of the process/property relationship is
              mostly empirical, based on experiments and trial and error. This project will
              address the fundamental complexity by characterizing the internal
              microstructures as related to the differences in the length and time scales of
              the process, and will undertake a hierarchical modeling approach based upon the
              Hamiltonian formalism of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.  A coupled micro- and
              meso-scale modeling scheme based upon the dynamics of the mean chain
              deformations that are governed by evolution equations obtained using the
              Hamiltonian approach will be tested against on-line and off-line experimental
              data obtained from the industry in this University-Industry collaboration.
              

This is expected to lead to better models that allow for an optimization of
              the high-speed fiber spinning process resulting in superior product quality and
              a lower processing cost.  The industry personnel will take an active role in
              providing educational experiences for the students as well.
