"LExEn:
              Windows of Habitability in the Jovian System from Coupled Thermal-Orbital
              Evolution Models"

This project is an investigation of the combined effects
              of heat transfer, orbital dynamics and tidal dissipation within the Galilean
              moon system (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto).  Developing efficient computer
              codes for spherical-shell thermal convection with variable properties and
              internal heating is the primary focus of the effort.  The computer code
              developed is being used to model the evolution of tidally interacting systems
              in order to place constraints on where and when liquid water may exist.  Such
              environments may provide habitats for life.  In addition, the thermomechanical
              behavior of ice and silicates undergoing melting into thermal convection
              calculation will be applicable to other geophysical heat transfer problems. 
              The calculation of heat flow out of the cores of Io and Ganymede will help
              understand the magnetic signatures detected by the Galileo spacecraft.  This
              information will aid the planning of future exploration of these potential
              habitats.

This project is part of the NSF Life in Extreme Environments
              (LExEn) program.  Funding is provided by the NSF Division of Astronomical
              Science Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics (AST/SAA) program, the Division of
              Biological Sciences Microbiology (BIO/MCB) program, and the Division of
              Chemistry (CHE).
