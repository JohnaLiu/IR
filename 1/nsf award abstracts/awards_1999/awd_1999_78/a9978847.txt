Abstract    :
              The Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques requests the National Science
              Foundation to provide some support for the visit here of numerous Americans who
              come and do advanced research in Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, both
              individually and in collaboration with IHES permanent professors.  Our
              statistics continue to show a large  proportion of US visitors :  more than
              twice the number of the next best represented country.  Visits here are on one
              of two bases : the first results from solicitation on our side, the second is a
              selection from applications we receive.  In both cases the choice is made on
              considerations combining personal research potential and the potential of
              interaction in the fields described below and which are presently very active
              at the IHES.  The names in brackets are those of our permanent fellows and/or
              long-term visitors.

        Combinatorics (O. Gabber, M. Gromov, M.
              Kontsevich)
        Discrete groups (M. Gromov)
        Algebraic geometry
              and number theory (O. Gabber, M. Kontsevich, C. Soule)
        Harmonic
              analysis (A. Connes)
        C*-algebras (A. Connes)
        Geometry and
              topology (A. Connes, M. Gromov, M. Kontsevich)
        Dynamical systems (H.
              Epstein, M. Gromov, D. Ruelle)
        Statistical mechanics, turbulence (H.
              Epstein, K. Gawedzki, D. Ruelle)
        Quantum field theory (K. Gawedzki, M.
              Kontsevich)
        String theory (K. Gawedzki, M. Kontsevich)
       
              General relativity, gravitation (A. Connes, T. Damour)

Activities in
              M-theory is likely to develop with the presence of Michael Douglas.  J.
              Froehlich will make long visits starting 2001.

The IHES is requesting US$
              100,000 for 1999-2000, US$ 100,000 for 2000-01 and a further US$ 100,000 for
              2001-02. This amount seems to us to be more than justified since our support
              for US mathematicians amounts to a far larger sum.
