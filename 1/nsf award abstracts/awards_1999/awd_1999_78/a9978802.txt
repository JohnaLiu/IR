This proposal is a
              collaborative proposal between researchers at the University of
              Nebraska-Lincoln and Vanderbilt University.  The PI's will consider several
              algorithmic problems associated with presentations of groups and semigroups. 
              In particular they will use recent results on Higman type embeddings of free
              Burnside groups into finitely presented groups in order to construct an
              infinite torsion group with a finite number of generators and a finite number
              of relations.  They will also use these embedding results to study
              computational complexity by algebraic means.  In a second set of problems, they
              will study connections between residually finite extensions of free groups and
              their connection with dynamics of polynomial maps over p-adic numbers.  A third
              set of problems is concerned with use of automata-theoretic methods to study
              algorithmic problems about subgroups of various classes and associated
              problems.  A fourth set of problems is concerned with the study of diagram
              groups---groups that arise naturally in connection with semigroup
              presentations.

Groups and semigroups are algebraic objects that arise
              ubiquitously in mathematics whenever one studies symmetries of a mathematical
              object.  When these groups and semigroups are well described, certain
              algorithmic techniques my be used to study them.  There are applications of
              these studies to a number of areas including computer science.
