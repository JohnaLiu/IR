Abstract    :
              The City University of New York (CUNY) proposes to use the NSF/MGE Program to
              increase the number of Black and Latino students receiving doctoral degrees in
              the following disciplines: Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science,
              Earth & Environmental Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, and Speech &
              Hearing Science. This proposed project, Minority Access/Graduate Networking in
              Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics (MAGNET-SEM), seeks to extend and
              evaluate a model for recruitment, retention and support that effectively links
              multiple layers of higher education across a multi-campus system. Incorporated
              in the model are four components: a) a supportive community of minority
              scholars; b) academic opportunities; c) systematic faculty and peer mentoring;
              and d) financial support. Building on previous successful experiences with
              minority-targeted programs, the project will combine social services, academic
              and non-academic types of support, and technology in the recruitment and
              retention efforts. Financial support of students will be a shared effort among
              the project, the CUNY system, and the individual colleges. Participating
              faculty and administrators are committed to the importance of early
              preparation, a network of communication, minority role models, and peer and
              faculty mentoring. Research preparation and financial support are also critical
              for developing minority students' interests and for translating those interests
              into successful degree completion.
