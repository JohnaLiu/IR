Abstract    :
              In order to 1) develop and implement a model for recruiting, mentoring and
              retaining minority students in SME doctoral programs, and 2) develop effective
              strategies for identifying an supporting underrepresented minorities who want
              to pursue academic careers, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst (UMass)
              will engage in a systematic faculty-driven plan that reflects best practices
              and approaches believed to be unique for producing minority SME doctorates. 
              The Wass MGE plan will address the national shortage, and increase levels of
              minority graduate student recruitment and retention, through six major
              strategies: 1) create a staffed administrative SME Recruitment and Retention
              Unit within the Graduate School; 2) identify and recruit underrepresented
              minority SME candidates through the use of "Diversity Teams" of faculty,
              students and alumni; partnerships with invited institutions; a summer research
              program and exiting campus resources; 3) change admissions criteria to reflect
              the balanced contribution of quantitative and non-quantitative variables; 4)
              develop a supportive learning environment designed to enhance academic skills,
              self-confidence and sense of community; 5) provide opportunities for students
              to become involved in an integrated program of teaching and research; and 6)
              offer multi-year stipend packages that support teaching and research.  All
              activities will be professionally evaluated.
