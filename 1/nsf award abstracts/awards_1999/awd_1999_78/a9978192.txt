This is a planning visit award for Dr. Stephen E. Silliman,
              of the Department of Civil Engineering and Geological Sciences at the
              University of Notre Dame, to travel to Benin to meet with Dr. Moussa Boukari,
              of the Department of Earth Sciences at the Universite Nationale du Benin.  The
              purposes of the visit are to develop a cooperative research project for the
              delineation of groundwater flow through fractured rock masses, and collect
              initial geochemical and historical data sets from ten sites.  In Benin, as
              elsewhere in Africa, high-quality water in ample quantities for domestic use is
              very scarce.  Much of Benin's water supply is provided by wells which are hand
              dug or drilled into fractured crystalline rock, but the lack of ability to
              identify where the best sources of water are located produces many dry wells. 
              The proposed research activity will study the complex interrelationships among
              fracture location, geology, geochemistry, remote imaging, and indigenous
              knowledge about local water systems and drilling histories.  The results are
              expected to produce a scientific method for locating high-quality water sources
              in fractured crystalline rock formations. 

Funding for this project is being
              provided jointly by the Division of International Programs and the Division of
              Earth Sciences.
