Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Engineering Research Center (ERC) for Advanced
              Engineering Fibers and Films (CAEFF) to acquire a portable x-ray diffraction
              device specially designed to measure the effect of stress on crystal growth as
              well as crystalline and amorphous orientation during both fiber and film
              formation.  The system will be designed, built, and installed by Bruker
              Analytical x-Ray Systems, Inc., in close collaboration with the ERC staff.  The
              vendor will provide training on operation and maintenance.  This equipment will
              overcome the problem of extremely long exposure times needed in the past to
              monitor the effect of stress on crystall growth and orientation during fiber
              and film formation.  This equipment will establish the critical links between
              the ERC's present and projected on-line equipment and the ERC's off-line
              analytical capabilities.
