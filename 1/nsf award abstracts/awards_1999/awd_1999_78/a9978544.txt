The Gordon Research Conference on "Organic Thin Films" will
              be held on July 11th-15th, 1999 in Newport, RI.  The goal of the conference is
              to facilitate interactions and information exchange among researchers with
              interests in polymers for biosensors and electroactive displays.  The NSF funds
              will be used to support the attendance of young American students.

There are
              emerging opportunities related to the design, synthesis, characterization and
              evaluation of organic thin films for biosensors and displays, critical
              technologies for United States industries.
