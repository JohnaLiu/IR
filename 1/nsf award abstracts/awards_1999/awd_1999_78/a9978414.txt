Abstract    :
              The proposed project will explore how mode of high school exit fits into the
              larger context of disadvantaged young people's transition to adulthood. 
              In-depth, qualitative interviews will be conducted with 80 young adults (age
              23), selected from among the low income families in a larger, on-going panel of
              Baltimore youth.  Interviews will be divided among four groups, balanced by
              race (African-American; White) and sex: 1) 20 who graduated from high school
              without interruption and went on to college; 2) 20 who graduated without
              interruption but did not go to college; 3) 20 who completed high school or a
              GED after first dropping out- "recovered" dropouts; 4) 20 dropouts who neither
              returned to school nor completed a GED- "continuing" dropouts.  These
              qualitative interviews, together with extensive survey and school record data
              that extend back to first grade, will be used to identify sources of resilience
              in low income urban youths' lives that help them overcome obstacles to a
              successful adolescent-to-adult transition.
