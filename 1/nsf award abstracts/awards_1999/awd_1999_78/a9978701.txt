ACE focuses on retaining students in
              entry-level undergraduate science courses through a combination of
              collaborative problem-solving sessions and one-on-one peer mentoring.  ACE
              provides a setting in which students master the appropriate course material
              while developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills.  In 1998, ACE
              served approximately 500 students, most of whom belong to underrepresented
              minority groups, providing co-curricular discussion sessions in the fields of
              calculus, chemistry, physics, biology and genetics.  Sixty-two percent of ACE
              participants graduated and seventy-five percent earned a degree in science,
              mathematics or engineering.
