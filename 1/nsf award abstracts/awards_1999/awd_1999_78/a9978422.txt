Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a workshop to be held in Berkeley,
              California, on May 26, 1999 to explore the  need for and advantages of  an
              American National Corpus of lexical and linguistic resources. The  workshop
              will be attended by university researchers, representatives of  the publishing
              community, and others interested in research in lexical and linguistic topics.
              The need for this workshop is critical to advance and coordinate resources
              needed in the rapidly growing area of natural language research in the United
              States.
