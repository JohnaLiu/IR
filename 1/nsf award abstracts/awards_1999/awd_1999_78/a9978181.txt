This research project will conduct a series of measurements
              in conjunction with the NASA mission SOLVE (SAGE Ozone Loss and Validation
              Experiment), to examine the issue of ozone loss due to halogen radicals in the
              arctic polar vortex. ClO, BrO, Cl2O2, CFC-11, particles, and ozone will be
              measured with fast-response in situ instruments between 10 and 30 km with small
              balloons to be launched from Kiruna, Sweden. Up to six launches will be
              scheduled from late November, 1999, through February, 2000, to address the
              following issues: 

. Flight 1 - Initial pre-PSC vortex composition,
              including particle, halogen radical, and ozone distributions,   and the impact
              of warm (~200-210 K) heterogeneous chemistry,
.  Flight 2 - Early-winter
              reactive chlorine (ClO + Cl2O2) partitioning and ozone loss at high-solar
              zenith    angles, 
. Flights 3-6 - Halogen activation by PSCs, mid-winter
              ozone loss due to BrO and ClO, and halogen recovery.

The project will be
              conducted in close collaboration with investigators from France and Sweden who
              will be conducting separate balloon measurements of NO2, OClO, BrO, ozone,
              water vapor, CFC-11, and CFC-12, and ground-based measurements of a large suite
              of compounds, including columns of BrO, source gases, and reservoirs, and
              profiles of ClO. Launches will be scheduled to overlap with other SOLVE
              activities to enhance the science objectives. This will include validations of
              coincident SAGE III measurements, intercomparisons with similar measurements on
              the ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft, and opportunities for correlative flights with
              balloons measuring long-lived tracers and reservoirs of halogen and nitrogen
              oxides. 

The primary objective will be to provide a unique data set with
              which to determine halogen activation and deactivation and ozone loss from the
              tropopause to ~30 km, and which can be used to suitably constrain models used
              to calculate ozone loss. This work will also complement activities outlined in
              the SOLVE NRA by providing high-resolution profiles that will extend the
              observations of similar species in time and vertical space (in the case of the
              ER-2 and DC-8) and by producing a more comprehensive set of measurements (in
              the case of large remote and in situ balloon payloads). 

The campaign will
              be directed by an experimental team that includes the PI, Prof. Terry Deshler
              of the University of Wyoming, Dr. Neil Harris of the European Ozone Research
              Coordinating Unit, Dr. Jean-Pierre Pommereau of Service d'Aeronomie du CNRS,
              France, and Prof. Sheila Kirkwood of the Swedish Institute of Space Physics,
              Kiruna, Sweden. The final flight schedule will be developed with additional
              input from the SOLVE science team, and launches will be based primarily on
              meteorological forecasts from the Goddard Space Flight Center trajectory mailer
              with information from 3-D photochemical models.
