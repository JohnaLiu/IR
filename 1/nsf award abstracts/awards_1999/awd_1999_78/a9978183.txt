Abstract    :
              This project addresses the needs of the legally blind to interact with
              information systems that utilize graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  The
              research focuses on the study of descriptive animated icons and the development
              of a framework to enable GUI developers to more effectively address the icon
              recognition process utilized by the legally blind when designing interface
              layout and functionality.  In an initial study the PIs will determine optimal
              sizes for icons, animated as well as non-animated, that are perceived by
              individuals whose visual acuity is in the range of 20/200 to 20/800.  This
              study will result in a heuristic that will allow them to describe the means by
              which legally blind computer users interact with a GUI.  The PIs will then
              design a library of animated icons which will serve as a foundation in the
              development of GUIs that are accessible to the legally blind.    A
              proof-of-concept application will be developed and evaluated using this
              technology, in order to provide information on how to properly integrate
              animated icons into a GUI to achieve the stated goals.  The PIs expect the icon
              library developed as part of this project to be applicable to a wide variety of
              application domains, and that the use of properly sized, descriptive animated
              icons in GUIs will help the increasing legally blind population to access
              information in electronic form.
