Early XXI century opportunities for multi-trillion transistor
              chips or terascale integration (TSI) engaging 100-10 nanometer (nm) technology
              will be governed by a hierarchy of physical limits whose five levels can be
              codified as: 1) fundamental, 2) material, 3) device, 4) circuit and 5) system.
              The key objective of the proposed research is to explore the novel hypothesis
              that in the era of TSI, the most critical constraints of this hierarchy will be
              imposed by a dominant subset of inescapable intrinsic stochastic limits that
              previously have been of little consequence and therefore very largely
              neglected.

Intrinsic stochastic limits on TSI emerge from two independent
              root causes. The first is random placement of dopant atoms in the channel
              region of MOSFETs; the second is the stochastic nature of the interconnect
              length distribution of a random logic network. The principal methods to be
              engaged in the proposed research are derivation of compact models that
              describe: 1) the stochastic distributions of key MOSFET parameters, such as
              threshold voltage, resulting from random dopant atom placement and 2) the
              complete stochastic interconnect latency distribution resulting from random
              logic circuit placement. Combining these two stochastic distributions enables a
              projection of the intrinsic limits that will govern the ultimate progress of
              TSI.

The significance of the proposed activity to the advancement of
              knowledge and education is that the research will provide a unique theoretical
              basis for projecting the terminal phase of the most powerful driving force of
              the most important technological and economic advance of the XX
              century.
