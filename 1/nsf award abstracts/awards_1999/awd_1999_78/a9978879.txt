Abstract    :
              Stony Brook proposes 1) to build on its existing initiatives to produce
              significant increases (as much as 300%) in the recruitment, retention, and
              doctoral degree conferral figures of underrepresented students in SME
              disciplines in five years, and 2) to develop models for the replication and
              institutionalization of strategies that prove to be successful. The MGE program
              will enable Stony Brook to improve the centralization of staffing, resources,
              planning, implementation, and evaluation activities. Key components of the
              Stony Brook proposal are: increasing the pool of graduate students by building
              on existing and new partnerships with AMP programs and HBCUs; departmental
              incentives for the admission and retention of targeted students; building on
              the 'Chain of Mentors'
program already in existence; developing a
              comprehensive data collection and tracking system; using evaluation to ensure
              replication and to produce change in institutional culture; and
              institutionalizing the model through the establishment of a management
              structure that involves top administrators. The mechanisms proposed by Stony
              Brook are designed to produce a profound impact on the doctoral student
              experience in the foreseeable future.
