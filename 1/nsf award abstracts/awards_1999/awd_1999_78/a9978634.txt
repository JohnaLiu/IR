Deteriorated sewer systems can be rehabilitated in-situ using any
              one of a variety of polymer linings (trenchless, lining) applied to the inside
              of an existing host-pipe. Here it proposed to develop and validate rapid test
              methods for determining the relative effectiveness of the various available
              technologies. In particular, the evolution of creep

compliance of the liners
              will be predicted for times up to 50 years by employing the time-temperature
              superpusition theory in concert with the equivalent-time theory; dynamic
              mechanical and creep compliance data in bending will be utilized as model
              inputs. Reliability of this procedure will be validated with full-size,
              long-term creep tests. Finally, a creep buckling model will be implemented
              using ABAQUS to interpret the full-size strain data in the post-buckling
              regime. Although data will be obtained on only four materials, results are
              expected to be applicable to a variety of polymers and polymer-matrix
              composites.
