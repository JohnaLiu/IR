Heraty and Pinto
	Small parasitic wasps of the Chalcidoidea group are
              important biocontrol agents throughout the world, with recorded effects on
              aphids, scale insects, and whitefly pests in both natural and agricultural
              environments. Although ca. 18,000 scientific names have been recorded for the
              group, the taxonomy, classification, and phylogenetic understanding of these
              minute wasps are poorly developed. With adults often less than 2 mm in size and
              consequently with few easily discernible features to aid in identification and
              classification, the taxonomy of the group has relied upon tedious microscopic
              examination, often from limited collections. New morphological characters from
              electron microscopy of whole-insect mounts, and new DNA evidence from gene
              sequencing, now offer a revitalization of the field, with pioneering
              contributions from this strong team of researchers at University of
              California-Riverside. An impressive network of collaboration has been
              established with the relatively few remaining specialists in the world, and
              these colleagues will also facilitate new field collecting of specimens and
              studies of existing major museum holdings in Europe and Australia. Graduate
              student training builds upon a substantial university commitment to research
              and training in entomology. Databasing aspects of the project build upon an
              existing website devoted to studies of wasp biology and systematics, with an
              expanding inventory of specimen data.
