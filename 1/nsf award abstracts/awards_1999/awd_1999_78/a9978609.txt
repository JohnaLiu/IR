Abstract    :
              Development of unique welding characteristics is required for improving the
              performance of many technologically important small lightweight components such
              as valves, welded link assemblies, biomedical devices. Superior welding
              qualities can be achieved by manipulating the transport properties in the weld
              pool. A novel process for welding based upon centrifugation will be
              investigated. 
The objective of the project is to understand the effect of
              centrifugal accelerations (1 gc <g<12gc) on the transport characteristics,
              microstructure, and joint efficiency of the weld. A unique and novel facility,
              known as the Multi-Gravity Research Welding System (MGRWS) will be used for
              this research project.  It can generate a net acceleration of more than 20
              times the earth's gravitational acceleration at the weld pool surface. Both
              autogenous (no filler) and non-autogenous (with filler) are welding processes
              that can be examined in the centrifuge. This project included well-planned
              learning experiences for graduate and undergraduate students that will enhance
              the "new generation" of manufacturing engineers' capabilities in the work
              force.
