Abstract    :
              Visualization systems are most effective when the user can interactively explore
              the data by varying the viewpoint and visualization parameters via direct
              manipulation. However, visualization applications fre-quently deal with
              extremely large datasets, so such interaction is often impossible. In addition
              to being large, these datasets often have high depth-complexity and
              non-polygonal primitives, which makes them poorly suited to most current
              graphics accelerators. This project will investigate the use of ray tracing
              vi-sualization applications. By exploiting parallelism and
              image-based-rendering (pixel reprojection) this project can create a system
              that is both interactive and responsive for very large datasets. In addition,
              the programmable nature of such a system will allow improved rendering effects
              such as shadows and transparency, and sup-port for non-polygonal primitives
              such as glyphs and volumes. To test the relevance and performance of this
              system the project will be tested in several application areas: medical
              visualization, fluid flow visualization, terrain visualization, and bioelectric
              modeling visualization.
