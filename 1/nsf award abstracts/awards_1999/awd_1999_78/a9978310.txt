Abstract    :
              This proposal is designed to provide a strong foundation for the microbiological
              community to explore and fully characterize the deep biosphere of oceanic
              sediments and rocky crust.  The direct purpose of the proposal is to facilitate
              the development of a permanent microbiology program on the ocean drilling
              vessel JOIDES Resolution.  Funding of this proposal will allow the U.S.
              microbiological community to fuly participate in the world's only continuous
              deep-ocean drilling program.  At minimal cost to LExEn and the microbiology
              community, this participation will provide unparalleled access to an unmatched
              diversity of sedimentary and crustal microbial habitats.
