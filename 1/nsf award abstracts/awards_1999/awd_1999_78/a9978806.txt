Abstract    :
              Life has evolved in close association with metals and it is not surprising,
              therefore, that evolutionary processes have selectively incorporated specific
              metals to take advantage of the additional chemical attributes that these
              metals bring to biological molecules.  Thus, the incorporation of Zn or Cu
              metal may confer additional steric possibilities, catalytic activity or redox
              properties to the acceptor molecule and these metalloproteins are known to
              control important biological processes as varied as gene expression,
              respiration and acid/base balance.

One intracellular protein that has been
              advocated to be involved in all of these processes in metallothionein, although
              the mechanisms by which this protein controls cellular metal homeostasis is
              unclear.  A novel technique (EC/HPLC/ICP-MS) involving directly coupling
              electrochemistry (EC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
              inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) will be developed to
              conduct a series of experiments that have been collectively designed to
              determine (i) the relative importance of glutathione and redox conditions
              necessary to cause the donation and acceptance of essential metals between
              metallothionein and apoenzymes within a complex cytoplasmic milieu; (ii)
              whether glutathione disulfide or oxidizing conditions can lead to the release
              of Cd and other physiologically toxic metals from metallothionein causing
              subsequent non-specific binding to target macromolecules.
