The overall goal of the proposed effort is the development of
              an integrated system capable of imaging blood flow velocity, shear rate,
              perfusion, and vessel structure using optical low-coherence techniques. The
              significance of this effort lies in the potential to develop better vascular
              stents, grafts, and factors for neovascularization control. The proposed work
              will help elucidate the mechanisms of intimal cell proliferation and new blood
              vessel formation. This will be accomplished with least-invasive procedures that
              provide physiological flow information with unprecedented resolution, and
              anatomical information previously only available by histology.

A
              miniaturized, flexible catheter delivery system, hardware modifications, and
              improved signal processing will be incorporated into to an existing optical
              coherence tomography system. With these augmentations, the vascular optical
              coherence tomography (VOCT) system will be able to provide important vascular
              system information including vascular structure, blood flow velocity and shear
              rate. Additionally, depth-resolved imaging of perfusion in vascularized tissues
              will be performed.
