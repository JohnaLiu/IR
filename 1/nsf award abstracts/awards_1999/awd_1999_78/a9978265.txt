Abstract    :
              Mountain Lake Biological Station was founded in 1921 as an inland field station
              for and teaching in the Southern Appalachians.  In the last twenty years the
              research program has developed a focus in population biology with an emphasis
              in ecological genetics.  Projects currently being conducted include studies of
              the genetics and epidemiology of a sexually transmitted disease in a plant, the
              behavioral and physiological ecology of juncos, the genetic structure of a
              local metapopulation, ecology and evolution of polymorphic life history in a
              plant, life history evolution and species interactions in salamanders,
              biosystematics and evolutionary genetics of ferns evolution of plant sex ratio
              biases, behavioral ecology and mate choice in salamanders, adaptive
              significance of the biological clock in chipmunks, the evolution of parasitic
              plants, and the genetic structure of seedbanks.

Mountain Lake houses up to
              100 students, faculty and researchers at a time.  Most of the living quarters
              were built in the late 1930s and aside from renovations of plumbing, porches
              and some roofs in 1992, they have not been renovated since.  Many of the
              accommodations are run-down and pose health and safety risks.  This project
              will support the renovation of most of the older cabins on the station. 
              Windows and doors containing lead paint and asbestos will be replaced in 16 of
              the older buildings; crumbling interior walls and wiring will be replaced in 5
              of the largest student dorms; leaking roofs will be replaced in 5
              cabins.

The other primary area to be upgraded is in computer and
              telecommunication facilities.  Researchers and students alike now require
              current computer and telephone technology and facilities to conduct their work.
               This project will support the installation of a full-service server/client
              computer and telephone network to provide file and application serving, full
              Internet access and telephone service to all research and teaching labs,
              administrative offices, and the computer lab on the station.
