For switching technology involving metal-oxide-semiconductor
              (MOS) devices,  SiC is a promising candidate to replace  Si because it may be
              thermally oxidized to form the insulating SiO2 layer, and it lattice matches
              well with an alternative insulator, A1N.  Most SiC studies show that devices
              built on the C-face (000-1) are inferior to those produced on the Siface
              (0001), but there are few investigations that address methods of improving the
              C-face. The PI's will conduct electrical measurements on MOS capacitors formed
              from the C-face and Siface of SiC, and they will investigate a variety of
              oxidation and post-oxidation treatments to look into the possibility of
              improving C-face MOS devices.  Recognizing the tendency for the C-face to
              graphitize more readily than the Si-face will provide a starting point in their
              search to find conditions which optimize the structural and electrical quality
              of carbon-face devices.

The proposed work has potential for advancing high
              power device technology in several ways.  Ultimately, the work should produce a
              recipe for making C-face MOS structures free from the difficulties which plague
              Si-face structures.  In the process, the PI's likely could improve Si-face
              devices; thus, they open the way to a variety of SiC-based MOS devices
              utilizing both the Si- and C-faces.  On a more fundamental level, the
              systematic series of controlled experiments proposed should reveal a better
              understanding of the differences between the two faces.
