Abstract    :
              While recent advances in the micro-fabrication of materials for the integrated
              circuits and microelectromechanical systems primarily rely on combinations of
              lithographic techniques and physical or chemical etching, these material
              removal processes are not very useful for the micro-fabrication of features in
              hard coating such as diamond.  This project investigates a novel method for the
              in-situ fabrication of a large variety of diamond microstructures ranging from
              the sub-micron to the sub-millimeter dimension by a pulsed dual-laser ablation
              process with a pulsed CO2 laser generated transient thermal micro-patterning
              process.  The growth of both freestanding diamond meso-structures as well as
              desired microstructures of diamond on silicon substrates will be studied.
              

The process will provide a versatile microfabrication tool for diamond that
              may be extended to other hard, tribological materials. The experimental study
              includes the determination of the relationship between energy, excitation and
              degree of ionization in the laser-ablated plume and the interaction with the
              substrate.  A theoretical model of the dynamics of the transient laser-induced
              thermal profiles on the substrate will be developed to predict possible feature
              sizes based upon the experimental findings.  The project provides exciting
              opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to gain experience in
              laser physics, materials science and thermal modeling.
