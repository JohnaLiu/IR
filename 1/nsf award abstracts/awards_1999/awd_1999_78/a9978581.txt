Dynamic Modeling and Analysis of Right-angle Geared Rotor
              System

The objective of this research project is to perform analytical
              modeling and computational analysis of the dynamic transmission error
              excitation and coupled torsional-lateral vibrations of right-angle geared rotor
              systems.  This class of power transmission system is commonly used in
              automotive and rotorcraft drive-train applications because of its ability to
              transmit high torque levels and rotational motion in the perpendicular
              direction.  However, the geared systems are quite susceptible to dynamic
              response amplification that causes undesirable noise and damaging structural
              fatigue.  In this study, the nonlinear time and spatial-varying gear
              mesh-coupling model of the gear pair system is developed.  The formulation
              includes the effects of tooth geometry and flexibility, angular rotation, and
              multi-tooth meshing process.  Also, the system dynamic response subject to
              transmission error excitation and input torque fluctuation is computed.  The
              analysis specifically examines the significance of time-varying mesh stiffness,
              clearance non-linearity, friction excitation, and variation of the tooth
              engagement process.  The proposed research is expected to significantly enhance
              the understanding of transmission error excitation generation and its effect on
              the system response.  In addition, the information and knowledge from this
              research are expected to contribute to the advancement of right-angle
              drive-train technology and development of newer generation power transmission
              systems with superior dynamic characteristics.
