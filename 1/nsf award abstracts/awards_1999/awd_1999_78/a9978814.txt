The
              objective of the proposed project is to improve turbulence modeling by using
              gravitational settling of particles as a simple flow experiment and adopting
              several new concepts in the simulation of turbulence dissipation.  Particles
              with the same index of refraction as the fluid are to be released into a
              quiescent fluid at a steady rate over the entire cross-section of the tank.  A
              three-dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) will be used to measure
              fluid velocity in the tank.   A small fraction of solid particles will be
              marked with a reflective coating for tracking.  The measurement will provide
              the volume averaged components of the turbulence energy and the components of
              the Reynolds stress for liquid and particles in a zone where the turbulence is
              established.  The effect of interparticle distance on turbulence dissipation
              will be evaluated.  A12-month award will provide the proof of concept of the
              three-dimensional two-phase PIV measurements.
