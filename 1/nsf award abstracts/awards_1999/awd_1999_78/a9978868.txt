Abstract    :
              The Mountain States Alliance for Minority Graduate Education (MGE@MSA) addresses
              the extremely low graduation rate of minority Science, Engineering, and
              Mathematics (SEM) students by increasing by 100% over five years, its annual
              total underrepresented SEM graduate student enrollment (from 696 to 1,392):
              increasing the annual M.S. degrees earned by these students by 75% over five
              years; and increasing by 100% over 10 years the annual number of SEM doctorates
              awarded to these students.

Our graduate preparation and admissions
              sub-component will increase the number of students recruited, facilitate the
              graduate application process, reduce expenses, and provide personal counseling.
              Once admitted, students will receive a program of activities that will
              significantly increase their retention and graduation rates . Activities
              include institutes and networks that utilize nationally-known experts to
              dramatically increase the number of excellent mentors and match minority
              graduate students with them. Other programs will help graduate students to
              progress efficiently and expeditiously toward degree completion and help them
              achieve postdoctoral, particularly faculty, career paths. MGE@MSA operates in
              Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and West Texas and makes use of
              and coordinates established programs many of which are already
              institutionalized and do not require additional resources, but rather, more
              students.
