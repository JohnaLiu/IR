The characterization of the structure of rock masses is an
              important
consideration in understanding how rock masses behave.  With a
              few
exceptions, most of the rock masses that engineers deal with are
              influenced
to some extent or another by discontinuities.  While we understand
              much
about the mechanical properties of intact solid rock, our understanding
              of
discontinuous rock is significantly less well developed.

Conventional
              wisdom indicates that for adequate characterization, data must
be collected
              using surface mapping.  Tools and models are designed for this
approach.  As a
              result drilling (borehole) data, which as the mainstay of
geologic exploration
              is omnipresent, is typically under-utilized.  Oriented
borehole data however
              has the advantage of being easier and more cost
effective to obtain.  Drilling
              can provide access to rock at depth and at
the precise locations where the
              data is needed.  Drilling data is an
integral and routine part of early site
              investigations, so it is almost
always available. Analysis is however not
              routine, largely because of the
lack of useful analysis tools which can make
              use of the measured data and
incorporate it into a model with practical
              value.

A new analysis tool being developed, incorporates the various
              attributes of
the discontinuities in a multivariate analysis, and uses
              multi-dimensional
clustering to identify joint sets and geological/
              geomechanical domains
(statistically homogeneous regions with respect to
              geological structure).
The method will make use of both statistical analysis
              and three-dimensional
visualization tools, in an integrated and automated
              package of computer
algorithms.
