The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design
              Projects Program  category, and requests support for undergraduate  student
              engineers to provide prototype "custom designed" devices and software to aid
              persons with disabilities.  The primary goal  is to provide meaningful design
              experiences for the engineering student that will directly aid a specific
              disabled individual.  A formal program is in place at SUNY Buffalo which will
              ensure satisfactory progress is attained on these projects.  A group of
              students and the investigators  will work with a  collaborating agency and
              individuals on these projects.  Seventy-five projects are planned during the
              five year duration of this award, and a written report on the completed
              projects will be submitted for an annual publication.  Once completed, each
              project will be given to the person for whom it is designed.  The hope is that
              this "real world" experience will give engineering students a sense of purpose
              and pride, help engineering schools serve the community, attract new students
              into engineering, and raise student interest in graduate education.

This
              type of undertaking is important since it provides a meaningful experience for
              engineering students as part of their undergraduate design requirements, and
              will also benefit a population where customization is often needed for
              rehabilitation devices.
