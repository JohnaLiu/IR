Abstract    :
              The UC Berkeley Excellence and Diversity in Graduate Education in Science,
              Engineering and Mathematics Coalition (The Berkeley Edge) requests a grant of
              $500,000 per year for five years from the National Science Foundation. The
              Berkeley Edge's goal is to double the numbers of minority students who earn
              doctoral degrees in science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM) and to prepare
              underrepresented minorities to advance into the highest ranks of the scientific
              profession, including the professoriate. The Berkeley Edge includes the
              graduate minority support programs in Engineering, Chemistry, the Physical
              Sciences, and the Biological Sciences, with close coordination with Berkeley's
              SEM minority support programs at the undergraduate level. Berkeley will
              institute new programs in the SEM disciplines, disseminate best practices and
              approaches consistently across the SEM departments and colleges, formalize and
              institutionalize discipline-based graduate minority support programs, and link
              efforts at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The MGE award will enable
              Berkeley, the largest producer of Ph.D. recipients in SEM, to initiate a
              meaningful collaboration with HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions
              that are the largest producers of minority BA/BS recipients in SEM.
