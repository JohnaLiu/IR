This grant supports work at the interface of statistical
              physics and theoretical computer science.  In particular this grant supports
              work involving the development  and application of cluster Monte Carlo
              algorithms in statistical physics, and the analysis of models in statistical
              physics from the viewpoint of computational complexity theory.  In the first
              area, the PI will extend previous work in developing a new invasive cluster
              approach to simulate the properties of materials described by lattice models. 
              In the second, the PI will apply computational complexity theory, which
              classifies problems according to the resources required to simulate them, to
              related materials theory models such as diffusion limited aggregation and
              invasion percolation.

This grant supports work at the interface of
              computer science and materials theory, with research proposed in two related
              areas.  The first area will emphasize the development and application of an
              innovative cluster Monte Carlo approach in statistical physics to expand
              current theoretical capabilities in computational modeling of phase transitions
              in materials.  The second area will emphasize applying developments in
              computational complexity theory from computer science to mathematically related
              problems in materials science such as the growth of materials in diffusion
              limited conditions and fluid flow though porous media.
