Abstract    :
              The investigators will study near-Earth substorm processes by statistically
              investigating the pre-onset magnetic configuration as a function of substorm
              intensity.  A substorm is the most dynamic magnetospheric phenomenon, and
              understanding its energetics is one of the outstanding questions in
              magnetospheric physics.  This study will make use of correlated ground
              magnetometer data and satellite measurements.  The substorm intensity will be
              measured by the amplitude of magnetic perturbations in mid-latitude ground
              magnetometers.  The stretching of the magnetotail before substorm onsets will
              be evaluated by comparing observations with magnetic field models.  The project
              will statistically examine the pre-onset tail magnetic configuration and its
              relationship to the intensity of the subsequent substorm.  By examining the
              time delay of a local onset of dipolarization, the investigators will examine
              the spatial development of tail current disruption and its dependence on
              substorm intensity.  The project will also provide useful information about the
              prediction capability of substorm intensity from near-Earth magnetic field
              observations.
