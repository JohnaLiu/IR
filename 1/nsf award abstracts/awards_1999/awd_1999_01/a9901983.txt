DDIG: Defining spatial scales of energy flow through
              river food webs using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes

Trophic linkages
              between terrestrial ecosystems, headwater streams, and downstream rivers are a
              fundamental feature of lotic ecosystems, but the scale of the processes that
              mediate food web exchange at a given site remain poorly defined. Two general
              approaches have characterized efforts to understand river food webs. The first
              approach analyzed changes in carbon sources and ecosystem function along
              longitudinal gradients from headwaters to large rivers. A contrasting approach
              has focused on understanding controls of community structure and function using
              experimental methods on a much smaller spatial scale. This project will examine
              stable isotope ratios of biologically active elements such as carbon and
              nitrogen to link these approaches by providing information about river food web
              processes at intermediate scales. This research is critical to understanding
              the spatial scales that are important to mobile top predators in rivers (i.e.
              fish), and could help guide management of rivers. The research will also help
              ecologists determine the appropriate scale of investigation in future river
              food web studies.
