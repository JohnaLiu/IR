Abstract    :
              This research program will continue the PI's efforts to develop nonlinear, data
              based models for predicting geomagnetic activity.  The new work will expand the
              previous methods to include arrays of ground-based magnetometers rather than
              just using various magnetic indices.  The spatial resolution provided by
              magnetometer arrays will provide information of the propagation of disturbances
              and should yield new insight into the possible triggering mechanisms for
              substorms.  It will also be possible to monitor and predict important physical
              quantities, such as the ionospheric electric field and Joule heating.
