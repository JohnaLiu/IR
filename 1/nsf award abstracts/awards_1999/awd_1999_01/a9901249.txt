Action
              Modeling

Research is being performed on the design and development of
              parallel algorithms for obtaining accurate models of natural objects and
              actions.  The goal of the work is to develop a suite of parallel, distributed
              algorithms executing on a network of personal computers that can integrate
              video images from multiple viewpoints to construct an accurate geometric model
              of a complex, rigid object, or detailed dynamic action models of moving,
              articulated and non-rigid objects - specifically people.  The work integrates
              and extends previous research in computer vision, hierarchical data structures
              and high performance software systems.  Geometric and statistical algorithms
              for extracting shape and action descriptions from single and multiple video
              streams are being used along with hierarchical spatial data structures (e.g.
              oct-trees and quadtrees) which constitute the basic data structures for the
              shape and action representations being constructed.  The enormous quantity of
              data and computation associated with applying such techniques and structures to
              a large number of video streams makes it impossible for vision scientists alone
              to design, construct and evaluate the  omputational performance of these
              distributed algorithms and systems.  Vision researchers are working together
              with parallel and distributed computing researchers to articulate a solution
              that includes geometric, algorithmic, and systems-oriented perspectives.
