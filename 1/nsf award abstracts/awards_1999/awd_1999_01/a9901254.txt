Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop a comprehensive methodology for
the
              synthesis of control dominated random logic circuits, targeting
              mixed
pass-transistor (PTL) and static CMOS logic. Central to this
              methodology
is the integration of top-down design partitioning and logic
              synthesis
with bottom-up layout assembly.  Specific  tasks include: a)
              algorithms
for initial Boolean network partitioning; b) novel BDD-based
              logic
decomposition driven by PTL/CMOS technology requirements; c)
              circuit
synthesis for mixed CMOS/PTL technology; and d) global level placement
               and
floorplanning to assume control over the wiring-induced delays in
              the
final layout. An experimental synthesis system based on this methodology
              is
now being developed.
