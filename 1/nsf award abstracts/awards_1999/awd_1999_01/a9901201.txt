Abstract    :
              Upadhyaya 99-01201

This US-Brazil award supports collaborative research
              between Dr. Belee R. Upadhyaya, University of Tennessee, Knoxville and Dr.
              Daniel K. S. Ting, Instituto de Pesquisas Energeticas e Nucleares (IPEN), San
              Paulo, Brazil. They will conduct a two-year research study on monitoring and
              diagnosis of process system components. 

The principal goal of this research
              is to develop new on-line monitoring and fault detection methods to improve the
              operational safety, reliability, and economic gains of large industrial
              systems. 

The proposed work is complementary.  The US PI will have access to
              two IPEN research reactors and a full scale thermal-hydraulic laboratory.
              Access to IPEN data and an understanding of issues relative to plant aging and
              life extension will benefit not only the PI but has application s to US
              industrial interests in general. 
Brazil will benefit from PC based signal
              processing and applied artificial intelligence modules to be developed by the
              University of Tennessee for testing at IPEN. The Brazilian commercial nuclear
              power plants are the ultimate receives of this technology.
