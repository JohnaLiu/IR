Title: Development of a general Theory for Control Systems Analysis
              and design Using Power and Energy Framework

The objective of this research
              is to develop a general theory to analyze multivariable control systems using a
              power and energy framework.  The proposed research will investigate the power
              energy interaction between various system input-output nodes and will develop
              tools for the frequency domain analysis and design of multiple input-multiple
              output systems using energy and power transfer functions.  As a Research in
              Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) activity, the proposed effort is designed to
              enhance the research environment in the recently created concentration within
              the Cal. State University-Fullerton Mechanical Engineering Department's
              curriculum in the area of Robotics and Automated Manufacturing and will promote
              interaction with local small manufacturing companies.
