This is a three year cooperative research project proposed by
              Dr. Zhangxin Chen, Southern Methodist University, Dr. Richard Ewing, Texas A
              and M University and Professor Zhong-Ci Shi of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
               The goal of  this project is to develop numerical methods for differential
              equations and their application to modeling and computer simulation of
              multiphase fluid flows in groundwater and petroleum reservoirs.  The efficient
              solution of nonlinear coupled systems of partial differential equations is
              important to many fields of science and engineering.  This project may provide
              efficient ways to obtain solutions to these nonlinear systems.  This project is
              jointly supported by the Chinese Academy of Science and the National Science
              Foundation
