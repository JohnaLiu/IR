Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses
              the control of S02 emissions to the atmosphere from coal-fired power plants. 
              The majority of utilities use blending of coal from different sources, as the
              means for the reduction of sulfur emissions. This project will produce an
              on-line analyzer that will assist coal producers and coal users in assessing
              the major coal bulk parameters of the blended coal. This analyzer will measure
              in real time, non-destructively, the sulfur and sodium content of coal along
              with other important parameters such as caloric value, moisture, density,
              volatile matter, etc.  The main features of the analyzer, which is based on
              pulsed fast/thermal neutrons, are self-calibration independent of the coal
              seam, diminished radiation risk, and better accuracy in the determination of
              elements such as carbon, oxygen, and sodium.
     The on-line elemental coal
              analyzer is to be used by coal mines, coal preparation plants, and coal-fired
              power plants worldwide.  In the US, there are nearly 900 of the above
              facilities, and  over 100 on-line analyzers have already been installed.  This
              project addresses the issues that the current generation of elemental analyzers
              has problems with.  In the beginning, it targets approximately 100 coal mines
              and power plants that, responding to our market survey, have indicated an
              interest in a second generation elemental analyzer.
