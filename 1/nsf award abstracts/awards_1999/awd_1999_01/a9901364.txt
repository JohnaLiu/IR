This project, Project PARTNERS  (Parents: Allies
              Reinforcing Technology and Neighborhood Educators Reinforcing Science) supports
              parents and their children in learning the mathematics and science taught in
              the schools.  The Bronx Educational Alliance (BEA), in collaboration with
              Lehman College, School District Nine, the Bronx High School Superintendency,
              and the Bronx Federation of High School Parent Association Presidents, provides
              a four-month Parent Academy twice a year. Thirty-six parents (20 elementary, 6
              middle and 10 high school), from 18 Bronx schools in three K-12 corridors with
              which the BEA Resource/Outreach Center for Parents currently works, participate
              in each Academy, reaching 360 over five years.

Project PARTNERS goals are
              to:  1) increase student achievement in 18 Corridor Schools through meaningful
              parental support;  2) provide parent training in Math, Science and Technology
              and enable parents to understand the New Standards;  3) develop skills to
              reinforce their children's learning at home; and 
4) model how to effectively
              learn in science-rich informal educational institutions.

Parents meet on
              Saturdays twice a month for six hours.  On one Saturday they team with a
              teacher and child to visit a science rich institution.   On the other Saturday
              they learn to use computer software programs which support MST, and math
              concepts through games and manipulatives.  Incentives for parents include
              learning computer skills and stipends of $300 upon completion.  The BEA
              Academies coordinate  with the BUSI and District's Family Math and Family
              Science workshops.
