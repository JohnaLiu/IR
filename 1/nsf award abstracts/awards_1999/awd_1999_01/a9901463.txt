Abstract    :
              This project is focused on studying the isotopic composition of chemically and
              radiatively important trace gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4)
              and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the stratosphere and upper troposphere.
              Continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry will be used to analyze a
              subset of whole air samples obtained from the NASA ER-2 high-altitude aircraft.
              The results will be interpreted in terms of (a) establishing a data base of the
              global-scale variations in stratospheric isotope compositions and (b)
              constraining isotope fractionation mechanisms in the stratosphere. Further
              objectives are to determine the feasibility of using isotopic observations to
              (a) quantify vertical and horizontal transport in the stratosphere, (b)
              distinguish chemical ozone loss from ozone changes due to transport alone, (c)
              improve estimates of stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and (d) derive improved
              estimates of the influence of stratospheric fractionation processes on the
              isotopic compositions of tropospheric N2O, CO2, and, by inference, O2.
