The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Laura Ferrer-Wreder with
              support for twelve months to work at Orebro University in Sweden with Professor
              Hakan Stattin.

Dr. Ferrer-Wreder will study youth adjustment and health
              outcomes to develop a course of prevention.  In the U.S. there is a growing
              number of young people at-risk for problem behaviors, such as school failure,
              high-risk sexual activity, juvenile delinquency and substance abuse. The main
              focus of this study will be an analysis of existing longitudinal and
              epidemiological data sets.  This analysis will be used to identify risk and
              protective factors that predict a specific cluster adjustment outcome.  From
              this a youth prevention program can be developed.  Sweden is the ideal place to
              do this research, because studying subjects in a small, homogenous country can
              alleviate the confounding factors that would be present in data collected from
              a diverse society like the U.S.  By implementing a psycho educational
              intervention in a supportive setting such as this, it will be possible to
              provide the foundation for the design, implementation and evaluation of a
              large-scale community-based intervention program for at-risk youth in the
              U.S.

Professor Stattin, a pioneer in the field of youth development and
              longitudinal methodology, has an international reputation in the study of
              normative adolescent development and psychopathology.  Both Professor Stattin
              and his university are highly regarded in the field of adolescent
              development.
