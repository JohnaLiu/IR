This project will undertake an examination of the structural and
              the electro-optic properties of cholesteric liquid crystals and explore
              possible device applications of these materials.  The project's primary focus
              will be a detailed study of the origins of the characteristic oily streaks
              textures and other defect structures in cholesteric liquid crystals, which we
              believe have hindered the utilization of these materials in unique-optical and
              electro-optical devices.  It is expected that the understanding that may come
              from the project would pave the way to make better monodomain samples which
              would simplify the interpretation of experiments, lead to a better
              understanding of these materials, and allow optical quality devices to be
              constructed.

Due to the explosive growth in the use of the internet,
              there is a growing need for wavelength selective components for use in the
              Wavelength Division Multiplexed architecture that will increase the bandwidth
              of the optical fiber.  We expect that the proposed research project will lead
              to new device structures for use the next generation of optical networks.
