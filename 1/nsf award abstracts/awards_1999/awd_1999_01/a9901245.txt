Professor is seeking funding to operate the "1999 International
              Multiparticle Dynamics" Conference on the campus of Brown University.  This
              Conference covers topics of particle interactions that are of interest to
              
EPP, Nuclear, and Particle and Nuclear Astrophysics.  It also worthy of note
              that funding sought goes toward supporting fledgling physicists.
