Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on the physics of
              fundamental interactions that lie beyond the currently understood regime of
              energies.  Investigations of these new interactions will use the theoretical
              structures of unification based on supersymmetry and superstring theories. 
              Supersymmetry and superstrings provide a framework which could lead to the full
              unification of all forces, including gravity. 
	The research to be carried out
              in this project will focus on signatures of unification in supercollider
              experiments and in dark matter searches.  Other aspects of the investigations
              will focus on more theoretical aspects of model building.  Studies will also be
              conducted to see if the unification of forces can occur in the realm of
              energies that can be reached in the next generation of accelerators. These
              investigations are of significance since the nature of physics at energies that
              will be achievable in the near future at supercolliders can unravel new
              dimensions of space time that appear in a class of string theories with a low
              unification scale.  Research to be carried out will identify the effects of
              these extra dimensions in precision measurements that will be made at the
              Tevatron at Fermilab and at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva,
              Switzerland.
