The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral
              research visit by Dr. P. Graham Mortyn to work with Dr. Gerald Ganssen at the
              Geomarine Center of the Free University in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  An
              additional six months of support is available based on the results of the first
              year of support, provided by the Marine Geology and Geophysics Program.
The
              aim of this research is to further develop and calibrate the oxygen isotopic
              composition and magnesium/calcium methods of assessing paleo-SST (sea surface
              temperature) in the fossilized carbonate shells of planktonic foraminifera,
              which are routinely preserved in deep-sea sediments.  The focus will be on
              mid-to High-latitude species calibrated with modern temperature measures.  If
              an independent relationship can be determined between salinity and
              magnesium/calcium, it would remove some of the obscurity in the use of this
              geochemical tracer as a sea surface temperature proxy.
Dr. Ganssen is a
              leading researcher in the field of paleoceanography and paleoclimatology.  He
              has formed a collaboration with Dr. Henry Elderfield at the University of
              Cambridge to measure Mg/Ca and Cd/Ca ratios from modern planktonic
              foraminiferal samples from the North Atlantic. Dr. Mortyn will benefit from
              being part of this three-way alliance linking three countries in the field of
              trace-element geochemistry.
