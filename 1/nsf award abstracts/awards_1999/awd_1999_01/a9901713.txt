Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is designed to
              develop a versatile, facile, and cost effective coating of plastic materials
              used in microchip and biosensor systems.  Passivation of the surface with a
              biomolecule-compatible stablizing agent, patterned imobilization of
              biomolecules, and other critical obstacles to the commercial development of
              bisensor technology will be resolved with a photoreative "universal binding"
              thin film surface.  Covalent phototechnical bonding of the passivating agent
              and of the high affinity general ligand (biotin) derivative, will be done
              quickly under mild reaction conditions by patterned and uniform illumination,
              respectively.  This passivated, hydrophobic "virtual well" array surface will
              then be useful for essentially any nucleic acid probe or specifc analyte
              binding protein (e.g., antibody) assay by printing with the desired ligands for
              the chosen analytes (e.g., oligonucleotides for nematode genes).  Specific aims
              include the demonstration of a plastic microscope slide array with 16 sites/mm2
              of X-avidin, stable to ambient storage for at least 3 months and providing a
              specific binding signal at least twenty times that of its noise signal in a
              probe hybridization assay.                                                     
                
     This program is expected to generate custom plastic microchips with up
              to 16,000 analyte sites per microscope slide, hydrophobic passivated slides
              with general binding ligands for customer printing of analyte arrays, and
              photoreative "virtual well" arrays on plastic slides and plates.  These
              products comprise a major part of a rapidly growing market of $1 billion in the
              near term.
