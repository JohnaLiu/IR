"Math Packs for Families" is a three-year project which will
              enable a broad spectrum of parents throughout the country to do interesting,
              fun, and enriching mathematical activities with their children in the context
              of everyday family life.  The project will develop, publish and disseminate ten
              Math Packs or packages of activities.  The innovative, realistic materials will
              help parents do math throughout the day, and within the constraints of everyday
              life, with their elementary (K-5th grade) children while doing housework,
              shopping, and meal preparation.  With the aid of one of the project partners,
              Ceridian Performance Partners, a leading work-family provider of contract
              services to small businesses (representing six million workers), it is
              anticipated the packs will be distributed to between 50,000 and several million
              parents at their workplaces across the nation.

The final component of the
              project is a research-based evaluation which will provide data to understanding
              how children learn math, the role of including the parent, doing math
              activities informally in the home setting, the efficacy of the Math Packs, and
              the effectiveness of workplace distribution.
