This award will bring together academic and industrial
              engineers from the United States and Vietnam, as well as from Japan, to present
              current research and discuss future directions on integration of hardware,
              software, and human performability in industrial computing systems and their
              applications.  The workshop will take place in Vietnam.  Seven American
              participants will interact with several hundred Vietnamese participants.  It is
              expected that this will lead to future cooperative research activities.
