Abstract    :
              The PI, Snowden-Ifft, in collaboration with Martoff (co-discovered of the
              principle of the new detector called negative-ion drift chamber) and a number
              of British scientists proposes to build a directional recoil identification
              track detector to search for weakly interacting massive particles.  Tests
              carried out with a prototype version of this detector showed that this detector
              has better background rejection than the current set of operating cold matter
              detectors based on scintillation and cryogenic detectors.  He proposes to build
              a 1 cubic meter detector in three years and operate it in the Bulby Mine in UK.
              The sensitivity of this detector is comparable with those of the current set of
              detectors but it will have the director sensing capability not present in
              current detectors.
