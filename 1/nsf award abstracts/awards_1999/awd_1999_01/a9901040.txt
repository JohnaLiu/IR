The principal investigators propose a
              coordinated experimental and numerical study of convection in the melt region
              of solidification that is due to compositional variations.  The mushy zone is
              the origin of a porous network of chimneys, called freckles, which degrade the
              quality of casting.  The research will further the understanding of
              silidification and lead to improve manufacturing processes.  The numerical work
              consists of developing new algorithms, based upon wavelet discretization, to
              determine chimney spacing and freckle formation.  This will reduce the time
              required for simulation and improve accuracy.  The experimental work will
              measure the velocity fields using an optically transparent analog of a binary
              metallic alloy using Molecular Tagging Velocimetry.   Different melt
              configurations in three dimensions will be studied.  The data will be used to
              validate the wavelet-based models.  The final results will be improved,
              gridless, simulation tool to study practical manufacturing configurations and
              processes.
