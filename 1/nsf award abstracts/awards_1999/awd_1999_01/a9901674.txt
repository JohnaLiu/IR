Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on the next
              generation of electronic packaging which requires the replacement of discrete
              passives with embedded devices to achieve the necessary gains in component
              density, performance, and cost reductions.  Of the three passive components,
              resistors, inductors, and capacitors, it is capacitors that are used in the
              highest quantities and have received the smallest amount of integration
              research.  Current capacitive materials for MCM-L substrate lack the
              dielectric, physical, and chemical properties required for future performance
              improvements. In the Phase I work, a new polyimide-barium titanate polyamic
              acid was developed which exhibited an order of magnitude improvement in
              capacitance, with the ability to form either a positive or negative resist. 
              This Phase II program will qualify this material to compete with current
              discrete mounted chip capacitors at reduced cost to the circuit board
              fabricator.  Polymer synthesis methods will be fine-tuned to further increase
              the dielectric constant of the base polyamide.  Production level deposition and
              photo patterning facilities at Sandia National Laboratories will be utilized to
              determine the ultimate line pattern resolution of the material.  To assure
              compatibility with commercial production processing methods, TPL will work with
              engineers from Allied Signal Laminate Systems to qualify the new materials to
              OEM specifications.
The electronics industry is growing 3-4 times faster than
              global and U.S. gross domestic product.  The market for MCM-L containing
              embedded capacitance is expected to grow at between 20 and 30% annually over
              the next 10 years.  This market is driven by high insertion costs for discrete
              capacitors (75% of total component cost), need for improved performance, and
              diminishing board space.  Sales of unpopulated circuit board stock are
              projected to be over $6B for 1998 in the North American market alone.  In 8
              years time, projections are that 25% of this market will include embedded
              capacitance at a total of $3-4B annually.
