Abstract    :
              The Marine Board of the National Research Council's (NRC) Commission on
              Engineering and Technical Systems serves the national interest by providing
              evaluations and advice concerning ocean developments and uses and the nation's
              ability to meet its marine and maritime goals.  The Board considers questions
              of the relationship of engineering and technology to coastal and offshore
              resource development and operations; to navigation and the commerce of the
              seas, waterways and ports; to related human resources and onshore activities;
              and their relationship to the establishment and implementation of public
              policies.  The Board identifies opportunities and needs for new technologies
              and other developments and recommends appropriate actions.  It stimulates the
              exchange of information and cooperative activities and provides a forum for the
              national and international professional community.

The activities through
              which the Board accomplishes its programs are: (1) assessments of the technical
              capability to undertake and manage offshore and maritime developments and uses,
              including the adequacy of knowledge to support technology development; (2)
              evaluations of safety of personnel and of the environment; (3) assistance in
              the preparation and assessment of the government's programs directed to ocean
              and maritime developments and uses and (4) identification of future
              opportunities for the integration of advanced technology into marine and
              maritime systems and the influence of technical advances on the establishment
              and implementation of public policy.
