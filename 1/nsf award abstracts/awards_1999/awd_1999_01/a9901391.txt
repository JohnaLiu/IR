Controlled Recovery in Distributed Systems 
PI:

A distributed system traditionally consists of a set of
              
interconnected processes that do not share a global memory. 
Communication
              among processes is either through locally shared
memory, or through messages
              that propagate along the links joining pairs
of processes. In many
              applications, a distributed system is required to 
stage a spontaneous
              run-time recovery from failures of an unforeseen nature, 
or from
              environmental perturbations. The design of such systems, known as
              
self-stabilizing systems or simply stabilizing systems, has been
extensively
              studied in recent years. 

A major weakness in current stabilizing
              distributed systems is their 
inability to correlate the recovery time with
              the extent of failure.  A 
second concern is the potential of non-faulty
              processes being contaminated 
during the recovery phase, a problem that may
              have alarming consequences 
with the rapid proliferation of large distributed
              systems. This motivates 
the study of controlled recovery in distributed
              systems, where control
implies that certain performance constraints are
              satisfied during recovery.
The study of controlled recovery will lead to a
              better understanding
of the design of safety-critical systems. In addition to
              studying
the algorithmic foundations of the design of such systems,
              applications 
in the areas of multimedia data routing and ad-hoc networks of
              mobile
nodes will be examined.
