The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network requests
              $1,518,318 to develop and pilot, in ten low-income communities, a two-pronged
              initiative for providing professional development for parents to be stronger
              advocates for their children in science, mathematics and technology.  The
              objectives for this project are to prepare a cadre of parents (or parent
              surrogates) at each of ten pilot sites to advocate for a stronger participation
              in quality science, mathematics, and technology education for their own and
              other children;  to establish an information and support network from which
              parents can retrieve educational resources via QEM's Website, an 800-telephone
              number, fax, and e-mail, and regular postal service.       

The pilot sites
              are Lowndes County, AL; targeted communities in Cleveland and Florence, SC;
              seven public housing communities in Atlanta, GA, Baltimore, MD, Chicago, IL,
              New York (Brooklyn and Jamaica), Norfolk, VA, and Tallahassee, FL.  The
              Community Service Centers (CSC's) established on neighboring college campuses
              serve the seven public housing communities with support from the Annie E. Casey
              Foundation, with technical assistance provided by the QEM Network.  The
              participating neighboring colleges are Clark-Atlanta University, Morgan State
              University, Chicago State University, New York City Technical College, York
              College, Norfolk State University, and Florida A&M University.
