Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project  will
              establish the Archive of Exemplary Behavioral Science Research Instruments
              (BSRI) on the Internet and on CD-ROM.  A printed Guide to the Behavioral
              Science Research Instrument Archive will also be produced. The BSRI Archive
              will contain searchable, edit-ready, and print-ready machine-readable versions
              of approximately 200 exemplary demographic, behavioral, and health science
              instruments-questionnaires, medical forms, interview protocols--used to collect
              the quantitative research data in the Sociometrics Data Archives and to
              document the effectiveness of the promising social intervention programs
              comprising the Sociometrics Program Archives.  Each of the topically-focused
              data and program archives that will contribute research and evaluation
              instruments to BSRI is a "best-of-the-lot" collection, carefully chosen using
              criteria of scientific merit, substantive utility, and policy relevance by a
              National Advisory Panel of scientists who are experts in that topical focus of
              the archives.  Norms for the scales and items comprising the BSRI instruments
              will be included in the archive in the form of scale means and standard
              deviations, item frequencies or response distributions, and item
              cross-tabulations with age, race/ethnicity, and gender, obtained from the
              linked data archives at Sociometrics.  If Phase II concept refinement
              explorations are successful, BSRI will also contain a link to the corresponding
              data file that will allow a researcher to select variables for a fully
              documented SPSS or SAS analysis extract file from BSRI's variable listing,
              original instrument, and/or item statistics.  This new feature should be of
              enormous help to the researcher, as it will allow him/her to see the complete
              context of the item prior to selecting it for analysis.
     BSRI's instrument
              search, edit, and print capabilities-along with its development in print,
              CD-ROM, and Internet formats-make BSRI a natural product for several thousand
              institutional target markets serving several hundred thousand individual users.
                Among BSI's target markets are: (1) academic markets, including 5,000+ social
              science departments, 160,000+ social and health science professors and
              researchers working in the topical areas covered by BSRI, 3,000+ main libraries
              at colleges and universities, and 100+ medical libraries in universities; (2)
              policymaking and business markets, such as the 200+ member Assoc. of Public
              Data Users, and (3) general information resource markets, such as 9,000+ public
              libraries.
