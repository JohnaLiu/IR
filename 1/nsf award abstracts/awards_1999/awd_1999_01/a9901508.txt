A three-year research project is proposed which contains a
              collaborative effort from scientists at the University of Dallas, the United
              States Naval Academy and the University of Kentucky.  The proposed research, in
              addition to exploring basic nuclear physics, will serve as a valuable means of
              introducing undergraduate students to scientific investigation.  Experiments
              will be completed at the University of Kentucky Van de Graaff Laboratory using
              the neutron scattering and gamma-ray detection facilities available there. 
              Data analyses will be completed by students and senior investigators using
              computational equipment located at the University of Dallas and at the United
              States Naval Academy.

Experiments are proposed on Tellurium-126,128, and
              130, to investigate the low-lying excitations of these nuclei.  This research
              is part of a systematic study of the stable isotopes of Tellurium to
              investigate the collective and particle nature of the excitations in these
              nuclei and how these structures evolve within this isotopic chain.  Gamma-ray
              angular distributions, Doppler shifts, coincidences, and excitation functions
              will be measured for transitions from levels in these nuclei up to an
              excitation energy of 3.3 MeV.  From these measurements, level schemes and decay
              characteristics will be determined.  Electromagnetic transition rates,
              branching ratios, and multipole-mixing ratios will deduced; these are extremely
              important for the comparison of models with experimental data.
