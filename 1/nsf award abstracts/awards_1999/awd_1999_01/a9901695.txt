Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to 
              continue development and commercialization of instrumentation to improve the
              accuracy of the determination of the molecular weight of polydispersive
              synthetic polymers by the automated combination of Size Exclusion
              Chromatography (SEC) and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass
              Spectrometry (MALDI-MS).  Combining both techniques eliminates errors due to
              sample polydispersity, SEC standards incompatibility and complexity in sample
              structure.  The SEC eluent is "painted" onto a foil, precoated with MALDI-MS
              matrix, to produce a track which is automatically probed by the MALDI-MS laser.
               The spectra are summed and the composite used to calculate molecular weight
              moments.  Research will quantify the effects of mass discrimination,
              matrix/analyte ratio, polymer solubility and MALDI-MS instrumental bias. 
              Prototype interface hardware will be simplified for ease of operation and cost
              reduced for wider appeal.  The project is supported by two manufacturers of
              polymer instrumentation and two polymer manufacturers.
     Some 8000
              laboratories world-wide routinely use SEC for molecular weight determination to
              control and predict polymer performance. MALDI-MS is the fastest growing
              instrumental technique for large molecule analysis.
