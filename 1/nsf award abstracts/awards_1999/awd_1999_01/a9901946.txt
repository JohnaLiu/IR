This proposal requests support for a group at Michigan State
              University for a program of research with the Tevatron proton-anti-proton
              collider at Fermilab and with the proton-proton Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at
              the CERN Laboratory in Geneva Switzerland.  The proposed redsearch program uses
              the CDF detector at Fermilab and the ATLAS detector at the LHC.  The CDF
              experiment has already yielded important results such as the discovery of the
              top quark and measurement of the jet cross section at the highest transverse
              energies.  This group has been an integral part of the CDF collaboration since
              1993.  They propose to design, construct, and test components of the hadron
              calorimeter (Tilecal) system for the ATLAS detector.
