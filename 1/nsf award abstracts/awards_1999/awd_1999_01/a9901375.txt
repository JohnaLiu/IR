A phase Doppler particle analyzer
              (PDPA) will be acquired for conducting research on metal sprays and
              materials-related droplet processes in the Departments of Mechanical
              Engineering and Physics at UCI.  This is a request for a research equipment
              grant (REG).  The equipment will be used for measurements of droplet size
              distribution, gas and droplet velocities in metal sprays.  The results will
              have impact on understanding basic phenomena in spray forming, the correlation
              between the fluid dynamics and resulted material structure properties,
              enhancing nozzle design, and as a reference base for model development.

The
              equipment will be used for several research projects sponsored by NSF, DOD,
              NASA, SNL and industry, as well as in undergraduate and graduate education.  If
              successful, the use of PDPA for molten metal sprays will lead to improved
              understanding of various droplet-based manufacturing processes, including
              nanostructured coatings.  The research has immediate industrial relevance to
              aluminum products.
