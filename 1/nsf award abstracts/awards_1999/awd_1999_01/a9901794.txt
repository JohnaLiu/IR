Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project  will
              optimize the performance and durability of high Specific Surface Area (SSA)
              catalytic coatings for methane combustion, and extend their development into
              prototype combustor applications.  In Phase I, reduced lightoff temperature and
              stable operation of methane-fueled catalytic combustor configurations were
              demonstrated by developing a high surface area coating for a novel Short
              Channel Length, High Cell Density (SCL-HCD) metal monolith catalyst substrate. 
              Two catalytic combustor configurations were successfully demonstrated.  During
              Phase II, more extensive testing of these concepts, both at atmospheric and at
              high pressure, will be performed with the aim of incorporating the combustor
              into a gas turbine engine.  Design, applications analysis, and viability
              assessment through interaction with product design groups at gas turbine
              manufacturers will be included in this Phase-II effort.
     The successful
              development of this technology is enabling commercialization of ultra-low
              emission catalytic combustion technology for natural-gas-fueled gas turbine
              engines in commercial applications such as distributed power generation and
              natural gas pipeline compressor drivers.  In addition, developing the high SSA
              coating has application in fast thermal response SCL-HCD automotive catalytic
              converters.
