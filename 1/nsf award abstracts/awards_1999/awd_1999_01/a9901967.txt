The Ft. Worth Museum of Science and History will develop
              "Texas Dinosaurs: How Do We Know? -- Regional Dissemination of Science Inquiry
              Exhibits and Educational Programs on Paleontology."  This will be a major
              permanent and portable exhibition project that will be accompanied by an array
              of educational programs for formal and informal audiences throughout Texas. 
              The permanent 12,000 sq. ft. exhibit, "Texas Dinosaurs: How Do We Know?", will
              recreate field and laboratory processes of paleontological research in an
              inquiry approach to public learning in geology, biology, ecology and
              mathematics.  Portable versions of the exhibit will be distributed to the
              Dinosaur Valley State Park in Glen Rose, the Texas Parks and Wildlife
              Headquarters, the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum in Canyon, the Science
              Spectrum in Lubbock, the McAllen International Museum, and the El Paso Insights
              Science Museum -- all in Texas.  Regional dissemination of "How Do We Know?"
              exhibits and educational programs and materials will reach at least 1.5 million
              people annually, including isolated rural communities in the large geographic
              region of Texas.
