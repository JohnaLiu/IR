Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on
              producing a miniature  photomultiplier for detection of light signals traveling
              on fiber-optic networks and for use as on-board high speed optical detection
              for chemical sensing in lab-on-a-chip and DNA sequencing systems.  Integrated
              optics for digital and analog data transmission and analog sensors can benefit
              from the high-speed miniature photodectors (>1 GHz). Solid state detectors are
              available with very high bandwidth or high gain, but not both simultaneously. 
              A high (>1,000) detector operated at low power with high speed and large
              dynamic range, and that could be integrated onto a silicon circuit would have
              value, especially as a fiber-optic receiver and sensor.  We propose a
              micromachined vacuum photomultiplier employing dynode secondary electron
              emission gain, a Planar Micromachined PhotoMultiplier Tube (PMPMT).  Such a
              device would make a superior chip-scale integrable high gain fiber-optic (FO)
              receiver, capable of substantially lowering the power performance  requirements
              of gigabit/s laser diode FO transmitters, the cost-barrier to ultra-high speed
              WAN networks.  Such a device would also enable truly field portable test
              equipment for chemical, biochemical and medical diagnostics.
     If this
              project is successful it could usher in a revolutionary new fiber optic sensor
              for telecommunciations networks.  Additional commercial applications exist in
              biomedical and chemical analysis labs-on-a-chip where a high speed optical
              detector can revolutionize rapid analyses such as DNA screening or chemical or
              toxin identification.
