Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will employ
              a new phenomena, high pressure electrokinetic (HPEK) pumping, for the
              development of high specific force precision actuators.  This research effort
              will demonstrate the utility of this new phenomena in both microscopic as well
              as acroscopic regimes, by combining HPEK pumps with slave devices such as
              micro-machined bellows and cm-scale diaphragms, to effectively translate the
              high pressure hydraulic flow into usable work.  Specific applications are
              targeted for the development of HPEK prototype devices. As part of this effort,
              the key actuator components employed in such devices will be systematically
              tested in order to assess optimurn designs, with subsequent integration into
              complete kinematic manipulation systems.
     These electrokinetic-based
              liquid pumps open the door to an entirely new class of devices for numerous
              high specific force applications. Applications include micropositioning
              systems, robotics components, supercritical chemical separations systems, and
              drug delivery systems.
