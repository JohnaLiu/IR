Abstract    :
              This project concerns investigations of technology in support of problem solving
              environments for advanced scientific computation, based on a higher-level view
              of the relationship of mathematical modeling to computation.  This is based on
              reconsidering

* Symbolic mathematical manipulation and computer algebra
              systems: These are tools and techniques that support problem solving, code
              development, comprehension, debugging and partial evaluation (the principle
              behind many optimization techniques).

* Data modeling and the interface
              between numeric and symbolic computation: in particular, the use of IEEE
              floating-point number representations and operations, and extensions for these
              representations in arbitrary precision arithmetic.  For example, in a number of
              problems we find an emerging need to compute with approximate real numbers
              beyond that which is provided in hardware. How can this be done efficiently and
              with correct characterization of accuracy?

* Exact or High-precision
              Computations, Series which may be in some sense be exact (coefficients) but
              also approximate, since they are generally truncated, used for tasks usually
              viewed as numerical.

* The use of scripting languages: the linkage of
              high-performance library routines to graphical interfaces for data analysis and
              modeling.
