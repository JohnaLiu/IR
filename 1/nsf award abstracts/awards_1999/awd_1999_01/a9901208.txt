This award to Columbia University in the City of New York
              will provide instrumentation for oceanographic research for use on R/V Maurice
              Ewing, a NSF-owned research vessel operated by the Lamont-Doherty Earth
              Observatory as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
              research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be acquired includes a cartridge
              tape drive, a thermal plotter and controller, six seismic source upgrade kits,
              two streamer tail slip rings, one GI gun, 20 float-retrieval winches, and three
              streamer recovery devices. The shared-use instrumentation supported here will
              enhance research capabilities for NSF and other worldwide programs on R/V Ewing
              in 1999 and beyond.
