Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project will demonstrate
              unique capabilities at Xidex's Six Degree-of-Freedom Atomic Force microscope
              (6-DOF AFM) technology for use as a critical dimension (CD) metrology tool by
              semiconductor industry.  Our CD-AFM design accommodates tilting of the AFM
              cantilever through large anqular ranges, thereby enabling the probe tip to
              access undercuts and re-entrant features. Our sensing system tracks the AFM
              cantilever in up to 6 degrees-of-freedom.  The CD-AFM also allows operating the
              cantilever and tip in the X, Y, and Z directions, enabling is to determine 3-D
              surface slopes.  This enables a scanning strategy where the raster step in Y
              can be altered for faster AFM imaging and better inspection of profiles in Y.
              Another advantage is elimination of cosine errors due to cantilever bending and
              tilt, vertical tip-sample alignment, and X and Y orthogonality error.  The
              semiconductor industry recognizes that a viable alternative to CD-scanning
              electronic microscope (CD-SEM) technology will be required within the next few
              year!!.  The shortcomings of CD-SEMs present an opportunity to develop a new
              AFM-based CD metrology tool to ultimately replace the CD-SEM and meet urgent
              needs of the National Technology Roadmap for production quality control at
              sub-180 nm feature sizes.
     Commercial applications include (a) critical
              dimension (CD) metrology tools for inline production quality control in
              semiconductor fabrication facilities and (b) tools for calibration of CD
              scanning electron microscopes (SEMs).
