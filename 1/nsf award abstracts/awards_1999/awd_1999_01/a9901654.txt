In this project, the PI will continue theoretical studies
              in two areas.  In the first, he will study the General Circulation of the
              Oceans with a focus on the abyssal circulation as affected by topography. Both
              steady and time-dependent circulation will be studied analytically and
              numerically. Laboratory experiments will supplement the theoretical studies for
              both steady and unsteady problems.   In the second, the PI will address the
              Linear and Nonlinear Baroclinic Wave Dynamics of Oceanic Flows, with a focus on
              steady circulation of buoyancy-driven flows in the laboratory.  The observation
              of instabilities, should they arise, will be studied analytically and
              numerically.
