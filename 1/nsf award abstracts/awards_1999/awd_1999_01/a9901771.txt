This award provides funds to support a 6-month research
              visit by Dr. Brian F. Atwater, Western Earthquake Hazards Team, U.S. Geological
              Survey (USGS), University of Washington, for collaboration with Dr. Kenji
              Satake, Geological Survey of Japan (GSJ), at Tsukuba.  These two scientists
              will collaborate on two projects about a January 1700 tsunami in Japan and the
              American earthquake at Cascadia that probably caused it.  The first is the
              writing of a book about these events and the series of discoveries that linked
              them.  The book will be written in English plain enough to reach a broad
              audience of American and Japanese citizens concerned with earthquake and
              tsunami hazards.  The second collaborative project may clarify earthquake and
              tsunami hazards in the United States by revising the estimated size of the 1700
              tsunami in Japan.
The immediate objective of the research is to learn the
              position of sea level in 1700 at several sites in Japan. These sites have been
              subsiding so rapidly in the past 50-100 years that the documented level of the
              1700 tsunami in Japan, if referenced to modern sea level, may be too low by a
              meter or more.  Both projects will implement two U.S.-Japan agreements to use
              tsunamis and coastal geology in assessing earthquake hazards.  One of these
              accords, the U.S.-Japan Earthquake Disaster Mitigation Partnership, is part of
              the Common Agenda for Cooperation in Global Perspective, while the other was a
              recently signed annex to the new Memorandum of Understanding between the USGS
              and GSJ.  The project will be beneficial to U.S. engineers, public officials,
              and others to justify earthquake-resistant design, tsunami-inundation zoning,
              and other public-safety measures at the Cascadia subduction zone.  In Japan,
              the project may encourage the use of  coastal geology to reduce losses from
              future earthquakes.  This project is supported under the Science Fellowship
              Program between the National Science Foundation and the Japan Foundation Center
              for Global Partnership.
