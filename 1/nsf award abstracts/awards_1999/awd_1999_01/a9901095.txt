Abstract    :
              Richard Stratt of Brown University is supported by a grant from the Theoretical
              and Computational Chemistry Program to extend his applications of the
              Instantaneous Normal Mode (INM) theory by the introduction of anharmonicities
              and nonlinearities in liquids.  Stratt hopes to transcend the limitations of
              his previous linear, harmonic picture for liquid dynamics while still retaining
              enough of the language of modes to permit an understanding of the molecular
              mechanisms.  In doing so Stratt seeks to broaden the short-time INM approach
              and bring it closer to resolution with the long-time hydrodynamic ideas. 
              Stratt will also seek to examine the molecular origins of two-dimensional Raman
              spectroscopy which owes its existence to nonlinearity and the intrinsic
              anharmonicity that exists in liquid motions.

The question of the influence
              of solvents on the dynamics and outcome of chemical reactions is of central
              importance to chemistry, given that most chemical reactions in nature and in
              chemical industry occur in the presence of solvents.  Stratt's research will
              help to gain a better understanding, on the molecular level, of the factors
              that determine the way the properties of a solute are  influenced by the
              presence of surrounding solvent.
