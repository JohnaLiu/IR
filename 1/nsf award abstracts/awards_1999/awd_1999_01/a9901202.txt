                                               The International Research Fellow Awards
              Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
              months of research aboard.  The program's awards provide opportunities for
              joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise
              and experimental conditions aboard.                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              This award will provide Dr. Janette W. Boughman with support for twelve months
              to work with Dr. Dolph Schluter at the University of British Columbia's
              Department of Zoology.                                                         
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                  Dr. Boughman will study the divergent sexual selection of
              Stickleback fish, testing costs and benefits of condition dependent handicaps
              in two populations.  The signals used to select mates can be influenced by the
              local environment, possibly leading to divergence.  This work will describe and
              compare reproductive benefits and viability costs of signalling in two light
              environments.  These results are important to the understanding of speciation
              (reproductive isolation).                                                      
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                    The host, Dr. Schluter,
              is renowned for his work measuring selection in natural populations and
              identifying the selective forces shaping morphology and behavior.***
