Abstract    :
              Geometric problems arise in many different disciplines.  In some areas, such as
              computer graphics, which inherently deal with geometric shapes, geometric
              problems of computational and combinatorial kind are fairly natural.   In other
              areas, such as networking, geometric formulations or methods are rarely
              employed.  Nevertheless, some networking problems of recent interest can be
              cast quite naturally in geometric terms, and addressed using computational
              geometry methods. This project identifies some important problems in graphics,
              databases, and networking that can benefit from computational geometry
              methodology.  These problems include shape and distribution-sensitive geometric
              algorithms for graphics, multi-attribute histograms in databases, and study of
              multi-dimensional packet filters in high-speed networks.
