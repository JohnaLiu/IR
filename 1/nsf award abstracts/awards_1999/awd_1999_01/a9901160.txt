Abstract    :
              This project deals with test strategies, modeling and design for test applied to
              core-based system on chip (SOC).  The goal is to develop a methodology and
              tools for testing a SOC in its entirety, including the individual cores and
              their interconnects. The approach is based on two complementary strategies
              dealing with structuralaccessibility and integration testing.  The first
              strategy aims at testing cores and interconnects together using precomputed
              test sets.  To solve this problem, test accessibility algorithms and short path
              routes to access deeply embedded cores in the SOC are being developed.  The
              integration test strategy employs embedded microprocessor cores to coordinate
              and schedule the entire testing process.  Further infestigations are into test
              architecture schemes, test compression/decompression techjniques, as well as
              test management and scheduling optimizations.  Experimentation is being
              conducted to develop a prototype environment and tie together the entire SOC
              methodology and software.
