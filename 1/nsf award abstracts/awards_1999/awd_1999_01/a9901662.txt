Abstract    :
              Leading-edge scientific and engineering computations and experiments
              can
generate data of unprecedented size and complexity. Terabyte data sets
              are
not uncommon now, and are being generated with increasing frequency. 
              To
accelerate the development of data management and visualization
              techniques
for handling large datasets, closer cooperation between
              individual
researchers from different disciplines is needed.  The objective of
              this
workshop is to gather researchers from diverse areas to produce a
              report
identifying the challenges of managing large data sets for data
              analysis
and visualizations, surveying currently available technology, and
              laying
out directions for future research.
