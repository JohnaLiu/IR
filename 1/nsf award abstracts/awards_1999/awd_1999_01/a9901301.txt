This award supports William Patrick, R. DeLaune, R. Gambrell,
              and graduate students from Louisiana State University Wetland Biogeochemistry
              Institute in a collaboration with Heinz-Ulrich Neue of the UFZ Center for
              Environmental Research in Halle, Germany.  The project will focus on the study
              of substrate factors affecting the methylation and demethylation of mercury in
              fresh-water lakes in Louisiana and in mercury-contaminated wetlands of the
              former East Germany.  The movement of methylmercury through the food chain in
              aquatic systems is a serious problem in both the southern US and in Europe. 
              One of the approaches to be taken in the work by the UFZ Center is to use the
              Wetland Biogeochemistry Institute microcosm technique to determine the
              solubility and mobility of various inorganic and organic toxic substances.  The
              topic of study is an important environmental problem world wide, making this
              work timely and of high priority.  Important and useful information for the
              United States will come out of this work and should help in various
              environmental problems facing the United States today.
