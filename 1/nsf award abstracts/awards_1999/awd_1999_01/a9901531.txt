The American Geophysical Union (AGU) is provided a block
              travel grant to support the attendance of students and young scientists from
              the United States at the XXII General Assembly of the International Union of
              Geodesy and Geophysics in Birmingham, England, July 18-30, 1999.  This major
              international conference will provide opportunities for the next generation of
              geophysical scientists from the United States to meet and interact with
              scientists from throughout the world.  AGU has managed block travel grants of
              this type on a regular basis for more than 25 years and has developed proven
              procedures for fair and effective distribution of the funds.
