Following the recent precise measurement of the ratio of the
              electric and magnetic form factors of the proton up to a four-momentum transfer
              squared of 3.5 GeV^2, in the Summer of 1998, the JLab Program Advisory
              Committee has approved a continuation to 5.6 GeV^2. These two form factors are
              directly connected to the charge and current distributions in the nucleon; they
              are of fundamental importance to both nuclear and particle physics.
The
              extension of the measurement of this important ratio to large four-momentum
              transfers will be possible using the recoil technique as in 1998. This
              experiment will provide the bench mark data necessary to test future
              theoretical descriptions of the structure of the nucleon. The precise knowledge
              of charge and current distributions in the nucleon is a prerequisite for the
              test of any theory of the strong interaction based on QCD.
Participation in
              several other experiments in Hall A at JLab will includestudy of polarization
              transfer in the photodisintegration of the deuteron and in photoduction on the
              proton. Likewise, polarization transfer in the transition from the proton to
              the delta resonance will be studied in 2000, making use of the same focal plane
              polarimeter developed for the program outlined above.  Recent progress in the
              characterization of the elastic backward pd scattering reaction, based on
              polarization observables, has brought us close to a model independent
              determination of the fundamental amplitudes which describe this reaction. Two
              experiments using multi-GeV energy polarized deuteron and proton beams at Dubna
              and Cosy(Juelich) will further contribute to this study of the simplest
              nucleon-nucleus reaction.
