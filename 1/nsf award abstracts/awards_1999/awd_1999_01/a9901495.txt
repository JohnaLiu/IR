Abstract    :
              The overall goal of this SGER Proposal is to determine if it is feasible to
              construct an economical, microfabricated cell sorter for sorting large numbers
              of bacterial populations generated in "directed evolotion" experiments.  An
              appropriate elastomeric material will be identified that minimizes the
              adherence of bacterial cells to the sorter surface.  A sorting method
              (identifies and separates tagged cells) will be identified and the appropriate
              software developed.  The viability of the bacterial cells in the apparatus will
              be determined.  This normally major effort is facilitated by the head-start the
              Quake Laboratory (Applied Physics, Caltech) has with a similar design for
              sizing and sorting single DNA molecules based on their fluorescent properties.
