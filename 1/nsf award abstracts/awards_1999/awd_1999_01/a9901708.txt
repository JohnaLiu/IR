Large numbers of fossil angiosperm logs have recently been
              discovered in the Turonian Moreno Hill Formation of New Mexico.  This find
              represents one of the few Cretaceous sites known where large fossil
              dicotyledonous tree trunks have been preserved.  The distinctive nature of the
              site is enhanced by its association with an unusual North American dinosaur
              fauna that appears to have Asian affinities.  The intent of this research
              project is to conduct a taphonomic study of this highly unusual fossil log
              assemblage in order to reconstruct the physiognomy, paleoenvironment, taxonomic
              composition, and depositional history of the ancient angiosperm forest. This
              information will shed light on the nature of early broad-leaved forests and
              provide a three-dimensional paleocological context for an atypical dinosaur
              fauna.
