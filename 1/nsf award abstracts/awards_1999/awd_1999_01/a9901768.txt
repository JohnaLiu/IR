Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              establish the technical basis for large scale manufacturing of continuous glass
              fibers with well-controlled chemical composition and dimensions, from oxide
              materials which form inviscid melts.  The process is based on the demonstrated
              ability to create and maintain liquids in an undercooled, non-equilibrium state
              at temperatures below the normal melting point.  The viscosity of the liquid
              increases in the undercooled state, allowing glass fibers with unique
              properties to be formed from materials that normally do not support fiber
              pulling operations.  In Phase I, the feasibility of producing fibers from
              materials with applications in infra-red optical transmission, fiber laser, and
              structural application was demonstrated.  The Phase II research will scale-up
              production of fibers and provide materials to collaborating Phase III partners
              for applications R&D.
     The proposed Phase II research will provide
              advanced oxide glass fiber materials for fiber lasers, infrared transmission,
              and ceramic composites in the telecommunications, medical, turbine engine
              industries.
