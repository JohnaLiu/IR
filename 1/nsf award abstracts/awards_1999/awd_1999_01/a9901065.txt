Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Paul Houston of Cornell University will apply product
              imaging techniques to understand better both photodissociation and
              photodetachment processes.  Photodissociation studies of NCO, SO2,
              benzaldehyde, and C2O will be made in order to learn how the initial state of
              the parent molecule or radical affects the product state distribution. 
              Detachment from C2-, O2-, phenoxide anions, polyenyl anions and enolate anions
              will be investigated to learn how the angular and energy distributions vary as
              a function of photodetachment wavelength.  These studies will improve our basic
              understanding of the coupling between quasi-bound and continuum states.

The
              results of these studies will help provide a better understanding of radicals
              and molecules important in atmospheric chemistry and combustion.  In addition,
              the techniques of imaging being developed may have an impact on a variety of
              unrelated fields including, for example, tomography.
