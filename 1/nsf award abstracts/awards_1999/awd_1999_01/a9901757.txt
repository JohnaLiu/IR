Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II proposal will
              demonstrate high -temperature mid-IR lasers at 3 to 5 um with an average output
              power >10 mW on 2 inch compliant universal substrates.
To revolutionize the
              mid-IR market, mid-IR semiconductor lasers must be able to operate at
              thermal-electrical cooled temperatures >220K with a long pulse length >10 us
              and an average power >10 mW.  The cost of a sterling cooler is too expensive to
              be affordable, and is not very reliable.  The current MIR semiconductor lasers
              are strongly limited by the available substrates. In a short term, only
              optically pumped lasers could meet the market requirements.  Type-II QW lasers
              have demonstrated many excellent performances such as above room temperature
              operations, record-low threshold pump intensity, and high quantum efficiency
              and high output power at low temperatures.  However, these devices suffer from
              the threading dislocations and poor thermal conductivity.  These problems could
              be well solved by growing these devices on compliant universal substrates.
   
               Critical military needs include IR countermeasures, chemical sensing for
              defense against biological/chemical warfare, eye-safe covert illumination, and
              free-space communications, Commercial markets include leak detection, in-situ
              process control, remote chemical sensing, IR spectroscopy, and glucose
              analysis.  With the development of room-temperature high-power lasers, this
              program should considerably accelerate the commercialization of mid-IR lasers
              to meet the potential needs of the huge defense and commercial market.
