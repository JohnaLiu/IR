Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              combine particulate reinforced titanium metal matrix composites (PRMMC) with an
              innovative forming process to produce aircraft engine ducting.  Metal matrix
              composites, designed for stiffness at elevated temperatures are extremely
              difficult to form into useful shapes.  A unique phenomenon, internal stress
              superplasticity, circumvents the forming problem by producing uniform viscous
              flow in titanium PRMMC's with only a light applied stress during repeated
              thermal cycling through the allotropic phase transformation temperature range. 
              Phase I produced uniaxial stretching of nearly 300%.  Phase II process
              development will transform PRMMC composite into useful axisymmetric tubular
              shapes, such as used for ducting on commercial aircraft engines, by utilizing
              advanced infrared heating (rapid thermal cycling at 1-4 cycles per minute) to
              "blow mold" a preform tube into final geometry in 30 minutes of superplastic
              forming.  The project will scale up uniaxial results to multiaxial sheet
              bulging and tube bulging processes on a 4 inch by 12 inch scale.  The final
              component will replicate a duct component from the aerospace engine industry. 
              
     Commercial applications include components such as aircraft engine
              ducting, heat exchanger tubing, offshore pipe fittings, and valves.  Complex
              shaped components, particularly those  axisymmetric in nature which require
              high strength and corrosion resistance, will benefit from this technology.  It
              is anticipated that these applications will span many market areas including
              aerospace, industrial, and consumer markets.
