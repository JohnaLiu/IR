Abstract    :
              The investigators will continue analysis of magnetic field observations acquired
              by satellite-borne magnetometers.  The effort is an integrated team approach to
              advance understanding of field-aligned currents, magnetospheric and ionospheric
              currents, and electromagnetic waves and turbulence.  The group will investigate
              two different research topics related to field-aligned currents:  comparing
              predicted to measured magnetic field perturbations along a satellite orbit, and
              studying the relative importance of driving sources for magnetohydrodynamic
              fast mode waves in the magnetosphere.  The first study will use measurements by
              the SuperDARN radar network and the AMIE numerical model.  The second study
              will make use of multi-point observations from the AMPTE, CRRES and GOES
              satellites.
