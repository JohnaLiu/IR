National Video Resources, in cooperation with the American
              Library Association and the Society for the History of Technology, is
              developing and implementing a national project that will engage an
              out-of-school adult public in  libraries around the country in a thoughtful
              discussion on the impact of science and technology in the 20th century.  Using
              documentary television and film as the basis for discussions lead by local
              science educators and/or historians of science and technology, participants
              will examine the rapid introduction of new communications technologies in the
              20th century and how major technological innovations have impact on our work
              and home lives.  Topics to be covered include the automobile, radio, film,
              television, the computer, and the Internet.  Fifty libraries across the country
              will participate in the pilot phase.
