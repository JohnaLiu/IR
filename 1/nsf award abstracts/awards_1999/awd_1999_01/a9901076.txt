The proposed research focuses on three questions concerning the
              evolution of chemical defenses and the underlying assumptions concerning the
              costs and benefits of producing defensive secondary metabolites.  The first
              question concerns the Resource Availability Model of chemical defense.  The
              proposed research will examine whether macroalgae grown under carbon (light)
              limitation produce quantitatively higher levels of defensive compounds than
              those grown in an optimal light environment, and whether chemical defenses in
              antarctic macroalgae of the nutrient-rich peninsula region are likely to
              include nitrogen compounds.  The second question addresses the Optimal Defense
              Theory in macroalgae and invertebrates.  The proposed research will determine
              the extent to which chemical defenses are more abundant in reproductive tissue
              or in other tissues with a high energy content, including offspring (larvae). 
              A corollary to this latter objective is a determination of whether
              lecithotrophic larvae have a higher incidence of chemical defense than
              planktotrophic larvae.  Finally, using previous work in the Ross Sea as a
              starting point, the investigation will determine the broad scale spatial
              variation in chemical defenses and begin to address the evolutionary factors
              which might promote variation, if it exists. The program will significantly
              advance our understanding of the evolution of chemical defenses as well as the
              nature and role of bioactive agents in the ecology of antarctic marine
              benthos.
