This award supports the PI and several graduate students in a
              collaboration with Peter Hellekalek of the Department of Mathematics at the
              University of Salzburg, Austria.  The project will focus on the development of
              new parallel pseudo- and quasi-random number generators and the construction of
              a more efficient independent set of randomness tests.  The US group has
              expertise in code development for parallel processors, while the Austrian group
              has expertise in methods of generating quasi-random numbers.  Random number
              generation is a field where theorists and practitioners have interacted little,
              and this project will help address that deficiency by combining the
              capabilities of the Austrian and US groups.
