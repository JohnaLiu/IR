"(Meeting Support)  Thermal Emission Spectroscopy and Analysis
              of Dust, Disks and Regoliths"
AST-9819368

Partial support is requested for
              a three-day meeting entitled "Thermal Emission Spectroscopy and Analysis of
              Dust, Disks and Regoliths."  The meeting is scheduled to occur at the Lunar and
              Planetary Institute during April 28-30, 1999.  The focus of the meeting will be
              on evaluating the extent to which laboratory data can be used to interpret the
              spectroscopic thermal emission properties of dust in the interstellar,
              protostellar and circumstellar environments and also in solid body surface
              regoliths.  The talks will be organized along four parallel themes:

1. What
              are the limitations of using laboratory reflectance spectra to interpret the
              thermal emission properties of  solid particles in space?
2. To what extent do
              the thermal emission spectra of stellar disks support the notion that the
              emitting particles share physical properties with the regoliths of astronomical
              bodies?
3. Under what conditions is a spherical approximation for such
              particles valid?
4. What are the uncertainties in the measured optical
              constants?

	A number of internationally recognized experts will present
              invited discourses on various topics related to the use of rotational and
              vibrational emission spectra as diagnostic tools for studying astronomical dust
              particles ranging in size from 5-50mm.  The Astronomical Society of the Pacific
              has agreed to publish the  proceedings of this meeting, so that the results
              will be broadly available to the astronomical community.

	Funds are
              requested for partial subsidy of the publication expenses of the proceedings
              and travel support for two invited scientists from the Ukraine.
