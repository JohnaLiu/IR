This project is designed document the diversity of
              North American Ephemeroptera by collecting new specimens of mayflies in poorly
              studied regions, creating new species keys, and expanding the existing database
              on ephemeropterans.  Cross-platform accessible software will be used for the
              datases, and plotting ranges will be facilitated with additonal software. 
              Input data for each sample will include taxonomic and accession information;
              new data will be captured from existing collections; species keys to certain
              problematic groups will be constructed; and any other diagnostic needs will be
              incorporated.  The databases will be web-accessible and form the basis for
              documentation of Ephemeroptera that will serve to facilitate their use as
              indicators of the health of entire benthic communities.
