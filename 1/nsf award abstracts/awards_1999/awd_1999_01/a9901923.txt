Soundprint Media Center is producing a series of 13 public
              radio documentaries entitled Exploring Space Science.  The series will target a
              range of audiences:  public radio listeners; listeners to radio reading
              services; visitors to planetariums, public libraries, and museums; teachers
              seeking additional information for core science subjects; and the parents and
              students who visit space science education centers.  The programs will survey
              scientific inquiry into and from space.  The series will include the
              architectures of the universe, the origins of the planets, global climate and
              atmospheric changes, and microgravity's effect on the human biomedical systems.
               A range of science will be covered including astrophysics, astronomy,
              planetary science, space policy, climatology and earth science, biomedical
              science, and the history of science.
