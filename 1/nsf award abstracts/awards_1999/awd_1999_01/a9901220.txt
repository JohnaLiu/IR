Abstract    :
              The conference "New Ideas in Particle Physics and Cosmology" will be held May
              19-22, 1999 at the University of Pennsylvania.  The conference will focus on
              very promising developments in superstring theory, which seeks to explain all
              of the basis forces of nature.  The conference will bring together outstanding
              leaders in this field for an exchange of ideas which is very important to
              further progress.
