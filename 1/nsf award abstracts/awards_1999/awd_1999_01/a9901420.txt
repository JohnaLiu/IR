Abstract    :
              	This proposal requests support for an experimental research program to
              investigate the constituent structure of matter by colliding 27.5 GeV electrons
              and positrons with 920 GeV protons.  The electrons and positrons are deflected
              in the interaction, called deep inelastic scattering, which yields a virtual
              photon which probes the structure of the proton.
The experiment is to be
              performed by the Penn. State University group and collaborators with the ZEUS
              detector at the HERA collider located at the DESY laboratory in Hamburg,
              Germany.  The deep inelastic scattering experiment probes electron and quark
              substructure to distances of 10^(-16) cm., and continues the search for new
              families of excited leptons and quarks.  In addition many tests of QCD physics
              may be performed, e.g., measurement of jet production in quasi-real
              photoproduction interactions are a sensitive probe of the photon structure. 
              During the three-year period of this request, it is anticipated that the HERA
              accelerator will achieve the high luminosity collisions that will permit study
              of very high momentum transfer (Q^2) phenomena which could indicate physics
              beyond the Standard Model.
