Abstract    :
              This project will use a theoretical and computational approach to examine some
              of the processes which may produce high energy electrons that are found in the
              Earth's radiation belts during magnetic storms.  In particular, it will examine
              the importance of wave-particle interactions which may energize the transport
              energetic electrons.  In addition, class of particle orbits known as Shebansky
              orbits allow particles to violate conservation of the second adiabatic
              invariant.  This project will evaluate the importance of these orbits in
              generating relativistic electrons.  The ultimate goal of the study will be to
              produce a new radiation belt transport code which could be used in a Geospace
              General Circulation Model (GGCM).  The creation of the GGCM is a major goal of
              the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) program.
