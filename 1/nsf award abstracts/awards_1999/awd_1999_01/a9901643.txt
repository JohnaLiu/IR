Abstract    :
              Professors Wachs and Stenger propose to investigate the catalytic oxidative
              desulfurizaiton of organosulfur compounds.  This fundamental process finds
              applications in the environmental remediation of byproducts from pulp and paper
              industry.  Fundamental kinetics and mechanisms of the selective oxidation of
              C1-organosulfur compounds will be studies on supported metal oxide catalysts,
              primarily those of V, Mo, Cr and Re.  Typical reactions are the oxidation of
              COS or CS2 to CO and SO2, and the oxidaiton of CH3SH to H2CO, SO2, and H2O, as
              well as the production of derivatives methanol and sulfuric acid.  The
              mentioned oxides will be supported on titania up to monolayer coverage and
              modified with W or Nb as well as K or P.  In situ characterization techniques
              for the solid will include Raman, IR, UV-Vis DRS, and solid state NMR. 
              Kinetics measurement will be performed in differential reactors as well as with
              temperature-programmed reactin spectroscopy.  The research will result in
              understanding of the role of reaction parameters such as rate determining step,
              number of metal oxide sites in the active ensembles, electronegativity of the
              support ligands, coordination of the oxidic support site, and interaction of
              co-adsorbed species.  In practice, it will lead to improved processes for the
              catalytic upgrade of sulfur compounds to valuable chemical intermediates.
