Abstract    :
              The interaction of various atmospheric trace gas species with soot will be
              examined under conditions relevant for the upper troposphere and lower
              stratosphere.  Soot particles, such as those released by aircraft engines,
              possibly catalyze certain reactions of atmospheric significance, such as the
              oxidation of sulfur dioxide.  In this study, the uptake of sulfur trioxide,
              kerosene, ammonia, hydrochloric acid, methyl bromide, and several gaseous
              hydrocarbons on soot will be studied as a function of temperature (120 to 250K)
              and as a function of gas partial pressure.  Using a multi-component Langmuir
              isotherm model, the binding constant as a function of temperature will be
              obtained, and from that, the heat of adsorption.  Soots of different origins
              and thus chemical composition will be used.  The effect of sulfuric acid on the
              interaction of the soot surface with sulfur dioxide will be investigated.  The
              experiments will be carried out in a vacuum chamber equipped with a Fourier
              Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, which provides information on the
              identity of the adsorbed species as well as quantitative coverages.  A mass
              spectrometer will be used to monitor gas phase concentrations including
              products of chemical reactions, if they occur.  This project is supported under
              the RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) Program.
