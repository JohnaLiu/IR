Abstract    :
              de Moustier
This award to University of California at San Diego will support
              testing in deep ocean conditions of the multibeam echosounder system on R/V
              Roger Revelle, a research ship operated by UCSD's Scripps Institution of
              Oceanography as part of the University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS)
              fleet.  The tests will be carried out using a remotely-operated vehicle and
              precision navigation.  They will precisely define source and receiver
              characteristics of the multibeam system in operational mode, which will allow
              calibration of measurements in future work involving this device for seafloor
              mapping and imaging, as well as other studies of acoustical properties of the
              ocean.  The tests will also determine to what degree the system conforms to
              manufacturer specifications, and if not in conformance, to help identify
              necessary corrective action.
