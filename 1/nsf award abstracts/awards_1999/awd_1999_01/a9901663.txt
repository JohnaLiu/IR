Numerous studies have now shown that the range of
              observed galaxy surface brightnesses and sizes is bounded by observational
              selection - principally discrimination against galaxies of low surface
              brightness - and not by the intrinsic properties of galaxies.  To determine the
              luminosity density of the Universe, the geometry of space-time and the
              evolution of galaxies requires a full range of galaxy surface brightnesses and
              sizes. 

Dr. McGaugh led a team that has completed a CCD imaging survey
              covering 100 deg2 designed to discover galaxies having very low surface
              brightness.  The survey is sensitive to an R band surface brightness of mR =
              27.4 mag arcsec-2 or better.  His team is conducting several ancillary studies
              using this database.  Galaxies cataloged from this survey are used to address a
              number of outstanding issues in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology.  These
              include the intrinsic surface brightness distribution of galaxies, the
              contribution of low surface brightness galaxies to the galaxy luminosity and
              mass functions, the stability of disks imbedded in dark matter halos, star
              formation thresholds in disks and the optical edges of galaxy disks.
