The Louisville Science Center will develop "'The World We
              Create' -- a Traveling Exhibit."  This project will develop two traveling
              version exhibitions (approximately 2,500 sq. ft. each) based on the programs of
              the highly  successful permanent 12,500 sq. ft. exhibition "The World We
              Create," funded by NSF.  One exhibit copy will travel nationally to small and
              medium-sized science centers throughout the United States over a three-year
              period, filling a need for quality traveling exhibits and reaching an audience
              of 300,000 to 500,000 people. The second exhibit copy will travel to rural
              areas of Kentucky to be hosted by schools, public libraries or community
              colleges, reaching an audience of 150,000 to 200,000 students and adults.
