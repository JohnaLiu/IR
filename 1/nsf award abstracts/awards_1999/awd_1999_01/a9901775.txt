Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovatione Research Phase II project from
              Collaborative Motion Control, Inc. will result in the development of
              Intelligent Materials Handling systems of a type that complements the physical
              and sensory capabilities of the human workers who use them.  This technology
              will bring aspects of robotic control, particularly the interface to computers,
              to the widely used "manual assist devices" which until now have been almost
              exclusively mechanical.  Building in part on Phase I research results,
              Collaborative Motion Control is entering into a product development
              relationship with a major manufacturer in the materials handling industry.  The
              resulting overhead-rail assist devices will offer simple and effective
              power-assist and provide ergonomic and productivity benefits.  However these
              devices will not offer task-level programmability.  Phase II research will add
              task-level programmability to the new class of assist devices.  Core cobotic
              components will be further developed and will make possible the implementation
              of virtual guiding surfaces.
     Commercial applications include automobile
              assembly, textile mills, food and beverage industry, and the many other
              segments of the materials handling industry in which human workers are
              essential, yet physical assistance and computer interface are needed.
