Abstract    :
              Many integer programming problems can be solved by examining a sequence of
              relaxations.  Possible relaxations include linear programming problems and
              semidefinite programming (SDP) problems.  This project is concerned with
              solving integer programming problems by using interior point methods to solve
              the relaxations.  The development of these methods will make it possible to
              solve problems that were previously considered intractable or too large. 
              Preliminary results show that an interior point cutting plane method is able to
              solve some far larger MAXCUT problems than with a simplex cutting plane method,
              that using a combination of an interior point and simplex cutting plane methods
              can be an order of magnitude faster than using either just an interior or
              simplex cutting plane algorithm for linear ordering problems, and that an SDP
              cutting plane algorithm for MAXSAT problems is considerably faster than other
              methods for certain instances with many clauses.
