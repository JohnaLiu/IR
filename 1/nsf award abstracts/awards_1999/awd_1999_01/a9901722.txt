Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project  will
              upgrade an experimental laboratory Spread ALOHA Multiple Access (SAMA) data
              network by adding the capability of chip slotted operation.  Slotting is a
              general technique used in conventional ALOHA channels with the capability of
              doubling the packet throughput of these channels.  Slotting has a similar
              capability in Spread ALOHA channels; however, slotting has two additional
              advantages in Spread ALOHA channels.  First, slotting can greatly reduce the
              latency of the channel by decreasing the retransmission delay of the channel. 
              Second, slotting permits the introduction of more flexible embedded reservation
              protocols in the SAMA channel.  The benefits of a chip slotted SAMA network
              will be a major simplification in the implementation of wideband
              connection-free multiple access channels, while at the same time increasing the
              throughput and performance of these channels.
     Research will lead to
              enhancements and upgrades for the Spread ALOHA-based SkyDSL (where DSL
              essentially stands for Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Loop) satellite internet
              access system.  It will also lead to a broadening of commercial markets to
              include cellular and Personal Communication System (PCS) and Local Multipoint
              Distribution Service (LMDS).
