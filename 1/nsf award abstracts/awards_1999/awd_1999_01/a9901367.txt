Abstract    :
              ASCHBACHER 9901367

Aschbacher will complete his project(with S.Smith) to
              produce a classification of the quasithin groups. This work will fill a
              significant gap in the classification of the finite simple groups. Aschbacher
              and Smith have produced a first draft of a proof, but because of the magnitude
              of the problem, a lot of effort is still required to produce a manuscript in
              final form. Aschbacher will also continue his project to produce a unified,
              accessible and complete treatment of the existence, uniqueness and structure of
              the sporadic simple groups. With G. Prasad, Y. Segev and G. Seitz, he will
              continue work on the anisotropic unitary case of the Margulis-Platonov
              Conjecture.

This research is in the area of group theory which can be
              thought of as the algebraic theory of symmetry in the abstract. As such it has
              many direct applications to many areas of physics and chemistry.
In the last
              thirty years group theory has been useful in solving problems in data
              transmission.
