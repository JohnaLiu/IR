This planning grant is in the area of teacher enhancement. 
              The project focus is to plan for the improvement of K-8 mathematics instruction
              and learning in the Fayette County (TN) Public Schools.  The project involves a
              planning team which includes two teacher representatives from each of the seven
              K-8 schools in the Fayette County, two high school representatives, the
              Director of Schools for Fayette County, a school board representative, a higher
              education partner from the University of Memphis, and Appalachia Educational
              Laboratory (AEL) staff.  Eleven district-wide meetings will be held during the
              planning period.  The planning grant was sought to determine needs and to
              create a plan for implementing a standards-based focus on K-8 mathematics in
              Fayette County.
