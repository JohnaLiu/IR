Abstract    :
              This research project explores the non-covalent chemistry of molecules and
              materials.  The design and characterization of aggregates of molecules or small
              objects held together by non-covalent interactions will be undertaken and
              understood through the principles of physical organic chemistry.  In
              particular, meso-scale particles at interfaces and in suspension, oligovalent
              species in solution, and molecular crystals will be studied in order to develop
              unifying principles extending those being uncovered in the areas of molecular
              self-assembly and supramolecular chemistry.

With this Award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Solid
              State Chemistry and Polymers Program of the Division of Materials Research
              jointly fund a research project to be carried out by Professor George M.
              Whitesides of Harvard University.  This project explores the nature of binding
              interactions that occur between molecules and aggregates thereof, in order to
              better understand the reasons why definite shapes are sometimes adopted, and
              why some interactions are stronger than others.  One example involves the
              extraordinarily tight binding of certain bacterial peptides by the antibiotic
              vancomycin.  Another involves the prediction of solid state structures of
              organic crystals, an important class of materials with new applications
              emerging in areas from optoelectronics to drug bioavailability.
