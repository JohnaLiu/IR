Abstract    :
              This research investigates new, efficient, and highly optimized solutions to
              large-scale IC placement under tight timing constraints. The focus of this
              project is to investigate the feasibility of applying recently
developed
              numerical algorithms, such as the fast multipole method for large-scale
              particle simulation and the interior-point method for non-linear programming to
              solving the large-scale constrained circuit
placement problem. Key elements of
              studies in this project include (i) direct handling of timing and
              non-overlapping constraints in a mathematical programming formulation; (ii) an
              hierarchical model of the problem allowing smooth approximations to non-smooth
              and discrete constraints; (iii) fast multipole expansions to accelerate
              evaluation of the constraints and their derivatives; (iv) fast numerical
              solution to KKT-based systems of linear equations used to calculate search
              directions in the optimization.
