Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to
              design a network of locally intelligent, acoustic monitors for deployment on
              water and gas pipelines. Each monitor will transmit data on a regular,
              long-term basis to a central base station.  Pipeline integrity monitoring will
              be performed using sophisticated signal processing methods to detect leaks at
              an early stage. Leaks manifest as pipeline vibrations due to the turbulent flow
              that emanates from the leak site. Currently, gas sniffing and water listening
              surveys are the most widely used means of leakage control.  In contrast to the
              present labor-intensive survey techniques, this proposal uses state of the art
              methods to detect leakage network-wide, below the current sensing thresholds
              and in an automated cost-effective manner.
     Commercial applications of
              this project are well defined. A product for monitoring water and gas
              distribution networks will be released during the last six months of the grant
              period.  If successful, the product will feature long-term data recording,
              remote processing, data transmission and alarm features. In subsequent years
              this product will be made more sophisticated and expanded to include electric
              utility pipe, steam, and long-distance gas transmission lines.  The total
              market potential in the US is estimated to be at least $400 million.
