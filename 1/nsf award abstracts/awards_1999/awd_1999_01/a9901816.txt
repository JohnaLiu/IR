Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project brings the
              auditory trainer technology up to the level of state-of-the-art wireless and
              computer technology.  The program will be to develop and test a miniature,
              wireless, software/voice controlled Digital Classroom Auditory Transceiver
              System (DCATS) for use in the hearing impaired classroom.  In addition to its
              educational benefits, this system will provide expanded communications
              capability both on campus and in home environments.  Cleveland Medical Devices'
              digital MicroRadio design will provide full duplex conversation, a long range
              (up to one mile) mode, and strong future expendability in a "wearable" form
              factor.  Future features include full duplex for more than two persons,
              microcellular operation throughout a campus, telephone interfacing, and
              software analysis of student speech.
     Cleveland Medical Devices proffers
              auditory trainer technology that has sales potential for voice transceivers
              specifically for the hearing impaired  as well as for electronic interfacing
              for hearing impaired persons.  In addition, spin-off opportunities for
              "wearable" voice transceiver products have very large potential.
