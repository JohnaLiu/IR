Abstract    :
              This project will use two models of magnetic substorms to develop theoretical
              picture of the global ground magnetic disturbance patterns and field-aligned
              currents associated with substorms.  The two models which will be used are the
              M-I Coupling models originally developed by Kan, and the Current-Magnetic
              Disturbance Conversion Code of Zhu and Kan (1989).  By producing accurate
              theoretical models of ground magnetic disturbance patterns it will be possible
              to improve the utilization of ground magnetometer data in substorm
              research.
