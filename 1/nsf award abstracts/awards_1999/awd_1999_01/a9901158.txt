The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Michael R. Williams with twelve
              months of support to work with Dr. Luis Antonio Martinelli at the University of
              Sao Paulo, CENA, in Brazil.  Support for this project is provided by the
              U.S.-Brazil Program.
Dr. Williams will be investigating the effects of
              land-use change on atmospheric deposition and nutrient cycling via throughfall
              (the precipitation that passes through the canopy of trees) in the Amazon
              basin.  Results from this work will increase our understanding of the chemistry
              of this tropical rainforest, which is one of the least understood biomes of the
              world. This research is critical to show how habitat destruction changes
              ecosystem function in the Amazon.
Scientists at CENA and the University of
              Washington are working on complementary research, on the biogeochemical
              dynamics in rivers and catchments.  Numerous collaborations will be forged, in
              addition to the one with Dr. Martinelli.
