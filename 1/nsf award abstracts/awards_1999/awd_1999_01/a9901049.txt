Abstract    :
              This project continues a variegated mechanistic organic research program that
              touches upon several aspects in the field.  These include investigations of the
              chemistry of excited state organic molecules, where it remains to be determined
              if radiationless decay to alternative products or energy barriers on the
              excited state hypersurface govern the course of events.  Methods used to probe
              these questions include quantum mechanical, theoretical, and experimental
              chemistry.  A different endeavor involves the case where a reacting molecule is
              imbedded in a cavity of limited and irregular size.  Conformational constraints
              then alter the otherwise observed course of the reaction.  

With this Award,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues support for the
              research of Professor Howard E. Zimmerman of the University of Wisconsin at
              Madison.  Professor Zimmerman's research activities are in the area of
              mechanistic organic chemistry, which involves making close observations of
              chemical reactions under a variety of conditions in order to determine
              precisely how they occur.  Since one cannot directly observe molecules as they
              react, one must devise other means of deducing these events.  Particular
              emphasis in Professor Zimmerman's laboratories is given to reactions that are
              initiated by the absorption of light, and of molecules that are trapped within
              crystals.
