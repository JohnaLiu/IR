Abstract    :
              The Chautauqua Program provides an annual series of workshops in which scholars
              at the frontiers of various science and engineering disciplines meet
              intensively for several days with undergraduate college science teachers. 
              These workshops provide an opportunity for invited scholars to communicate new
              knowledge, concepts, and techniques directly to college teachers in ways which
              are immediately beneficial to their teaching.  The primary aim is to enable
              undergraduate teachers in the sciences to keep their teaching current and
              relevant.   

This program is national in scope and will immediately benefit
              an estimated 2,000 faculty during the next year.  These faculty, in turn, will
              positively influence more than 350,000 undergraduates enrolled in their
              courses.  This national program which has a significant impact on the quality
              of undergraduate programs in both two- and four-year institutions helps to
              attract and maintain a healthy supply of graduates in science, mathematics,
              engineering, and technology fields.  It also contributes to empowering all
              students with scientific and technical literacy and numeracy required for fully
              effective participation in modern society.  The program is also very cost
              effective.
