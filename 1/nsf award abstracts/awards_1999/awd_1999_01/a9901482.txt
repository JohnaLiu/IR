The potentially large gapes of productides, and of
              brachiopods with deltidiodont dentition in general, also are of interest
              because many of these brachiopods may have had a fundamentally different type
              of lophophore (the ciliated feeding organ of a brachiopod) than the lophophores
              of cyrtomatodont brachiopods.  As the lophophore is soft tissue, and calcified
              lophophore supports are not always present, the nature of the lophophore in
              fossil brachiopods is often conjectural.  However, there is growing body of
              evidence that many strophmenides, chonetidines, and productides had
              ptycholophous (lobate lophophores oriented in a single horizontal plane)
              lophophores.  In contrast, most brachiopods with cyrtomatodont dentition have
              some type of coiled lophophore.  Ptycholophous brachiopods may feed better with
              larger gape angles, and the evolution of characters facilitating such angles
              and maximum opening moments that sustain gape may have been an evolutionary
              breakthrough.  The ability to gape wider may have made productides more
              effective competitors with other suspension-feeding organisms, and favorably
              influenced their rapid diversification.  This study will test that
              hypothesis.
