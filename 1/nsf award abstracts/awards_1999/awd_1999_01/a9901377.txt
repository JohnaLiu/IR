CISE Experimental
              Partnerships:  An Experimental Configurable Computing
System for Wireless
              Communication

An experimental configurable computing system based on the
              RaPiD architecture is being constructed that will demonstrate the advantages of
              coarse-grained configurable computing architectures in the domain of signal and
              image processing.  The work involves the construction, demonstration and
              analysis of a prototype smart antenna CDMA wireless basestation using this
              experimental system.

The focus of this research is the emulation of the
              RaPiD configurable architecture using the large Xilinx Virtex FPGAs that have
              recently become available.  This RaPiD Emulation System has the same
              functionality as a single-chip RaPiD system that is the eventual target of this
              architecture.  The goal is for the emulation to have sufficient performance
              running at a target speed of 50 MHz to demonstrate real-time applications such
              as the CDMA wireless basestation.  Each component of the RaPiD architecture is
              emulated using FPGAs, including the datapath, the datapath controller, the
              stream controllers and the memory controller.  This experimental system is
              being used to emulate the final RaPiD architecture.  That is, the FPGAs are
              operated in a way that is constrained by the RaPiD architecture in order to
              provide an accurate measure of the cost and performance of the RaPiD
              architecture.  This emulation system provides opportunities to explore many
              alternative architectural and system ideas related to RaPiD.  This exploration
              could lead to an efficient definition of the RaPiD architecture as a
              computational core in system-on-a-chip technology.
