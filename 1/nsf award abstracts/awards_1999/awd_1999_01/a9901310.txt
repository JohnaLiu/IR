Abstract    :
              This project will continue to investigate the feasibility of a set of
              country-level indicators on international competitiveness in high-technology
              industries.  This research will examine a number of ways in which the existing
              indicators might be improved and adjusted to account for recent advances in
              thinking about the definition of "high-technology" (e.g., the inclusion of
              nonmanufacturing industries and software products), recognition of the
              significance for future competitiveness of national leadership in emerging
              technologies (e.g., biotechnology, microelectronic-mechanical systems),
              improvements and expanded country coverage in international patent data, and
              advances in bibliometrics and citation analysis.  The feasibility of such
              changes in terms of cost, data reliability, country coverage, and comparability
              with past indicator series will be explored.
