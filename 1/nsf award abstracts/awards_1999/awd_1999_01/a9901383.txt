This US-Mexico award will support Professor Alvin D.
              Compaan, of the University of Toledo, Ohio in a research collaboration with
              Professor Gerardo Contreras-Puente, of the National Polytechnic Institute
              (IPN), Mexico in a three year study of thin-film materials for photovoltaics. 
              The extensive research effort ranges from film growth and fabrication of
              devices, to characterization of optical-electronic properties of complex
              materials and electrical performance studies.

This project will bring
              together experienced teams of researchers with complementary facilities in CdTe
              solar cells.  Economic studies conclude that solar cells should last 20 to 30
              years in an outdoor environment to be cost effective.  Long term degradation in
              the field is a major challenge for the use of solar photovoltaics to provide
              the world with a sustainable source of energy. Results of this study should
              produce recommendations to the solar thin-film cell fabrication community for
              structural changes and processing improvements that will enable improved high
              temperature stability of cells and modules.  This, in turn, will enhance the
              length of solar cell life and provide a more cost effective energy
              source.
