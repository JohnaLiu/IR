The proposal describes a program to develop a new approach,
              based on recent success in speckle characterization of high scattering media by
              the PI, to achieve imaging reconstruction. The PI has demonstrated that speckle
              statistics depend on the coherence time of the laser source used in the
              measurement and the standard deviation of the mean photon travel time in the
              medium. This work will expand on these findings by refining the measurements
              using coherence-synthesized sources and explore techniques for reconstruction
              of the imaging through inversion schemes that employ diffusion equations and
              statistical metrics.
