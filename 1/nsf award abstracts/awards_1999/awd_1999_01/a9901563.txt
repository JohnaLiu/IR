Abstract    :
              Our program will explore the interactive physical chemical processes at play in
              gradient driven submarine environments by focusing on three key questions
              within a hydrothermal system on the Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca
              Ridge.  These questions include:  1) What are the physical and chemical
              consequences of phase separation in black smokers; 2) What is the origin of
              low-temperature difusely venting fluids that are associated with
              high-temperature fields, but which also occur far-field, and 3) How can tidal
              perturbations be used to explore subsurface chemical and microbiological
              processes within a single hydrothermal field.  Invesigaion of thes questions is
              important in that phase separation (e.g. boiling), diffuse venting, and tidal
              forcing operate in many, if not all, ridge crest hydrothermal environments; all
              of these processes are accessible for direct study in the four hydrothermal
              fields on the Endeavour.  Using a range of in situ physical and chemical
              sensors and a new strategy for sustained fluid sampling, we will document the
              effects of tidal perturbations in fluid temperature, pressure, composition, and
              flow rate in areas of both high- and low-temperature flow.  Our goal is to
              develop a series of interdisciplinary models linking the processes that produce
              these changes.  In addition, observed tidal effects will provide insights into
              the responses of the entire system to ientifiable perturbations and may allow
              us to develop models of subseafloor flow paterns and permeability
              structure.
