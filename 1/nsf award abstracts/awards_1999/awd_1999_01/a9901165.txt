This interdisciplinary project aims to investigate
              intercalation in heavy metal iodides including (1) the synthesis and
              formulation of new materials (2) investigation of the bonding mechanisms in
              these materials to optimize their performance, and (3) involvement of under
              represented undergraduate students in research projects.  The emphasis will be
              on studying the photosensitivity, photoimaging, and bonding mechanisms in these
              wide bandgap semiconductors.  Intercalation of lead-, cadmium-, and
              bismuth-iodides with small guest molecules will generate a new class of
              intercalation compounds distinct from both the graphite and
              transition-metal-dichalcogenide systems.  Determining the factors that control
              bonding will provide insights into controlling and optimizing the unique
              optical properties of this new class of materials.
%%%
A large increase in
              the optical absorption above the band-edge and a decrease in absorption below
              the band edge is observed for these materials produce sharp optical band edges
              that can be optimized for applications that include visible light solar cells,
              high resolution photoimaging, and high-speed optical switches.  This
              multidisciplinary proposal is jointly supported by the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Affairs.
