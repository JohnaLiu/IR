Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses
              the need for enhanced student learning through virtual experimentation and
              user-driven visualization.  Recent research strongly indicates that
              simulation-based learning produces significantly better results for a wider
              range of students than traditional learning drills.  Phase II objectives center
              on expanding classroom tested AgentSheets technology to large-scale student
              creation and sharing of interactive simulations and virtual worlds that combine
              intra-school student creations and World Wide Web resources.  AgentSheets is an
              agent-based graphical spreadsheet environment that lets a wide range of users
              create SimCityTM-like interactive simulations, domain-oriented visual
              programming environments, games and cellular automata.  Phase II research
              centers on professionalizing the AgentSheets Behavior Exchange developed during
              Phase I and introducing, testing, and maintaining new agent organization
              techniques.  Phase II techniques for scaling up to larger school systems
              include Sales Agents.  An important Phase II research component is the
              insertion of AgentSheets into the normal school curriculum through on-going
              classroom experience and student teacher training.  By the end of Phase II,
              Agentsheets aims to have AgentSheets technology in regular use in a variety of
              real-world K-12 classroom environments.
     Commercial applications include
              simulations and modeling for education and research, games, programming tools,
              and virtual reality applications in architecture, medicine, and data
              analysis.
