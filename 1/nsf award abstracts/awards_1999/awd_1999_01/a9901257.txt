Abstract    :
              This award is being made through the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
              program to enable the collection and analysis of data on the response to the
              threat of Hurricane Georges in Miami-Dade and Monroe counties during the period
              of September 22-26, 1998.  This will set up a comparison with the response to
              Hurricane Andrew which struck the area in August, 1992, and was previously
              studies.  The major research questions that this project will address include:
              (1) At the time of landfall, were the communities of Miami-Dade and Monroe
              counties better prepared to resist the potential effects of Hurricane Georges
              than they were at the time of Hurricane Andrew?  (2) What factors best explain
              differences in disaster response at both the household and community levels? 
              Data for the study will be collected through a telephone survey of a random
              sample of residents and through in-depth interviews with key organizational
              officials.
