Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project is to demonstrate
              the concept of a precise radar reflectometer implemented as a hand held mine
              detector to measure a very small change in reflection caused by an obscured
              anomaly (buried plastic land mine).  A monostatic radar sequentially
              illuminates the search area with an array of small foot print collimated
              antenna beams.  The antenna footprint is designed to approach the smallest mine
              size to improve detection.  Detection is realized when there is a small change
              in the reflected signal between adjacent antenna beams as the array is scanned
              over the ground.  The vector signal from each antenna is processed to generate
              the standard dual axis direction finding pattern that improves the estimates of
              target location, size and shape.  The radar frequency (500 to 900 MHz) is
              selected to obtain good penetration of the ground and to use cellular telephone
              components to keep the power drain and cost low- It is estimated there are over
              120 million mines abandoned in more than 60 countries, killing 10,000 children
              and adults every year and maiming thousands more.
     There are two
              commercial opportunities for the mine detector, military mine detection and
              humanitarian mine clearing.
