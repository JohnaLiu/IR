Abstract    :
                   The disease pathogens of Pythium and Fusarium cause significant losses to
              corn producers when weather conditions are conducive to the plant pathogens and
              the seed is not pretreated with a protective fungicide seed treatment. 
              Chemical seed treatments are commercially available to control the effects of
              these pathogens on seedlings.  However, no effective treatment is commercially
              available to control the root and stalk rots that these pathogens cause in
              later growth stages of the plant.  A combination fungal/bacterial antagonist
              has been identified that may effectively control these pathogens in the early
              plant growth stages with continued protection thoughout the growing season. 
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is   directed
              toward:  (1) identifying additonal bacterial antagonists; (2) scaling up of
              biocontrol fermentation processes; (3) establishing large scale procedures for
              downstream processing, packaging, and storage; (4) evaluating biocontrol agents
              in field trials; (5) assessing the stability of the biocontrol agents;  and,
              (6) assessing root colonization of the biocontrol agents.  Phase III
              commercialization will involve EPA approval and marketing of the tested
              product.
     This project is designed to develop commercially viable
              biological disease control agents for corn.  Because the product is expected to
              effectively provide season long disease control, and the present chemical
              fungicides do not, it is anticipated that hybrid seed companies would readily
              accept an alternative product that is more effective. The US market potential
              for this product is estimated to be in excess of 150 million dollars.
