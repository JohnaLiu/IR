Abstract    :
              Dr. Bolte is measuring the luminosity function of galaxies (GLF) in the nearby
              Universe; in other words, determine the distribution of galaxies by luminosity.
               He is using very wide field CCDs to image individual member galaxies in two
              nearby galaxy groups:  Leo and Coma I.  Once we can define the current GLF we
              can better interpret various cosmologies.  All cosmologies that forma galaxies
              from post-recombination density fluctuations in the early Universe predict an
              initial GLF.  Knowledge of the distribution of galaxies by luminosity and mass
              in the current day Universe is required to interpret the data at different
              epochs in the evolution of the Universe.  He is imaging the GLF to luminosities
              near those of the lowest dwarf spheroidal galaxies (with absolute magnitudes in
              the R-band of -9.5) in the Local Group.  He is  verifying the membership of
              each galaxy that goes into the GLF and evaluating  the counting completeness
              with Monte Carlo experiments.
