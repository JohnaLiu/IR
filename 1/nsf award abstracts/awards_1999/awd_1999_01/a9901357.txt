Title:
              Local, Regional and Remote Effects of Northern Hemisphere Snow Cover on Western
              U.S. Climate and Water Resources: A Multiscale Investigation

The primary
              goal of this collaborative investigation is to identify, characterize, and
              quantify the local, regional and remote effects of snow cover on the western US
              climate and water resources. The present proposal considers snow not as a
              passive responder but as an active driver of climate variability on multiple
              scales.  The effects of snow cover within the western US and the climate
              signals due to remote snow forcing will be considered. Empirical analyses and a
              suite of model experiments will be conducted. The work is important because it
              will lead to enhanced understanding of the role of snow cover in climate
              variability on a range of spatial and temporal scales.
