The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral
              research visit by Dr. Robert R. Hudgins to work with Professor Thomas Kiefhaber
              at the Biocenter of the University of Basel in Switzerland.
Dr. Hudgins will
              study the problem of protein folding. Specifically, he will look at the
              kinetics of simple model systems that represent the earliest stages of folding.
               He will use triplet-triplet energy transfer and fluorescence correlation
              spectroscopy to characterize the dynamics of polypeptide chains with different
              degrees of structural organization.  These will be benchmark studies from which
              the slower kinetics of true proteins can be fully understood.
Dr. Kiefhaber's
              lab has established a model system to study the dynamics of the earliest steps
              in protein folding using designed model peptides.  This is a perfect location
              for Dr. Hudgins as well, because the Biocenter is internationally recognized
              for its many biologically related research programs, and the city of Basel is
              an international center of biopharmaceutical companies.  He will be able to
              network with numerous researchers in addition to those in Dr. Kiefhaber's
              lab.
