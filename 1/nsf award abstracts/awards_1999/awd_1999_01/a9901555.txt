This US-Mexico award will support a workshop on Lorentz
              groups, CPT, and neutrinos to be held in Zacatecas, Mexico, June 23-26, 1999. 
              Organizers are Dr. David Ernst of Vanderbilt University and Dr. Valerie
              Dvoeglazov of the Universidad Autonoma de Zacatecas, Mexico.  An international
              advisory committee, composed of prominent scientists mostly from Latin America
              and the U.S, provided guidance on workshop topics and invitees for the
              activity.  The workshop will specifically address work on the role of the
              Lorentz group and discrete symmetries, charge conjugation, parity, and time
              reversal in the development of contemporary field theories.  It will also
              address experimental implications of much of the theoretical work, including
              neutrino masses and oscillations.  Given the variety of topics, and the
              well-focused approach on the strengths of participating institutions in both
              Mexico and the U.S., the workshop is expected to enhance U.S.-Mexico
              collaboration in theoretical physics.
