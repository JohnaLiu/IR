Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in
              new Proton Exchange Membranes (PEMs) that are low cost and useful above 100
              degrees C. PEMs require condensed water to attain useful conductivities.  At
              temperatures above 100 degrees the PEM dries out and conductivity drops
              drastically. But high temperature is preferred for optimal performance of
              state-of-the-art oxidation catalyst systems.  At very high sulfonic acid
              concentration the boiling point of water in the membrane is elevated and higher
              operating temperatures are possible.  Phase II will extend Phase I discovery of
              conditions for sulfonating chemically inert polymers.  We propose a new method
              of manufacture of very high sulfonic acid content membranes that results in
              mechanically strong films.  The process can be run in batch or continuous mode
              and is projected to produce low cost PEMs.

The novel proposed electrolytes
              will allow major advances in fuel cells.  Light weight, high energy density
              fuel cells are needed for powering electric vehicles and for man-portable
              applications.  Both defense and civilian applications present large potential
              markets.
