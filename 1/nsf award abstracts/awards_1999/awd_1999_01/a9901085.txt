Abstract    :
              The two most significant periods when magnetospheric energy is transported from
              one region to another and shifted from magnetic fields to particles are during
              magnetic storms and substorms.  In particular, during storms and substorms a
              substantial portion of the energy to converted into the high-energy portion of
              the particle distributions.  This research program will use theoretical
              techniques and numerical test particle tracing techniques to examine how the
              energization of particles takes place and how the energetic particles are
              transported within the magnetosphere.  The ultimate goal is to produce a
              predictive model of energetic particle injection during storms and substorms. 
              This model could then be used in the construction of the GGCM.
