This Americas Program award will support travel and
              related expenses for 9 senior and 3 junior US researchers to participate in
              joint US-Chile workshop on nonlinear analysis, with emphasis on nonlinear
              partial differential equations and the calculus of variations.  It will take
              place in Santiago, Chile, January, 2000. Organizers are Dr. Paul  Rabinowitz,
              University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Drs  Raul Manasevich  and Raul del Pino,
              University of Chile, Santiago.  The participants include a group of European
              mathematicians to be supported by their own governments.

The workshop  will
              strengthen existing ties and help form new ones between researchers in the USA
              and their Chilean counterparts.  The workshop  will consist of main talks each
              day with short presentations by younger participants followed by discussions.
