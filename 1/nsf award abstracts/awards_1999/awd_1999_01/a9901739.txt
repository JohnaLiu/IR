The aim of this GOALI project is to apply resonant x-ray
              scattering in a novel way to characterize the structure of various chiral
              smectic-C phases found in two different liquid-crystal compounds.  The goal is
              to increase the experimental resolution to obtain higher quality data and more
              detailed structural information.  In addition, at least two new experimental
              approaches will be tested and implemented, including the in-situ application of
              aligning electric fields to the  liquid-crystal film samples, and the extension
              of the technique to liquid crystals containing atoms at higher resonance
              energies.  In the latter case, the liquid crystals can be directly studied with
              device cells.

Instrumentation development plays a crucial role in
              advancing technology.  Developing the hardware and analysis tools to apply
              resonant x-ray scattering to measure orientational correlations in liquid
              crystals can be applied to a wide variety of other systems, e.g., organic thin
              films deposited on metal or semiconductor surfaces, with the organic materials
              able to be studied directly within device cells.  This is a highly
              multidisciplinary and well integrated research and education project involving
              a collaboration between the University of Minnesota and Lucent Technologies,
              with a strong international component.  It is jointly funded by the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Materials Resesarch.
