              ABSTRACT
EEC-9901611
TALUKDAR

The power industry must undertake a managed
              redesign of the nation's power system so that it can adopt to deregulation and
              to rapid changes in the power requirements and economic conditions.  This
              planning grant funds Carnegie Mellon University to hold an industry/university
              meeting to determine the feasibility and viability of becoming a research site
              associated with the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)
              for Power Systems Engineering.  The Carnegie Mellon University research site
              would be an expansion of the existing multi-university I/UCRC with five
              research sites.

The research agenda of the I/UCRC will be broadened by this
              research addressing projects on the use of autonomies agents for control and
              energy trading; information security, technology evaluation and data mining.
