The Science Museum of Minnesota, in collaboration with Discovery
              Place and Science North, is producing a pilot stage for a large format film on
              the life work of Dr. Jane Goodall; her principal research site, Gombe National
              park in Tanzania; and her study subject, chimpanzees.  The film will be a
              journey into the world of the wild chimpanzee with Dr. Jane Goodall, the best
              know living woman scientist among adults in the United States.  It will
              chronicle Goodall's life work as well as the work of other researchers in
              Gombe.  Accompanying educational material will include a companion kiosk
              exhibit, a leadership institute for museum educators, an online program, and
              women-in-science classes for children and parents.  During this pilot stage,
              the project team will produce large format test footage in Gombe and will
              further develop the script for the film.

The principal science advisor for
              the project will be Dr. Anne Pusey, professor and director of the Jane Goodall
              Institute's Center for Primate Studies at the University of Minnesota.  She
              will serve as a Co-PI along with Mike Day of the Science Museum of Minnesota;
              Freda Nicholson, CEO of Discovery Place; and Sue Griswold, VP for Programs and
              Education at Discovery Place.  Mike Day also will co-executive produce the film
              with Jim Marchbank, CEO of Science North.
