Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II will provide IC
              manufacturers with a real-time sensor to optimize the efficiency of their
              Plasma Etch and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) chambers.  Etch and CVD are the
              staples of semiconductor manufacturing.   In both, deposits accumulate on
              chamber walls, eventually flake off and cause particle defects that reduce
              yields.  The manufactures control defects with periodic chamber cleans, and
              thereby decrease the availability of their expensive tools.  Cleaning schedules
              are currently set conservatively and statistically.
     The state-of-the-art
              ultrasonic Sensys Sensor has three competitive advantages:  (1) it measures
              precisely the naturally occurring deposits inside the chamber; (2) exterior
              mounting eliminates the possibility of contaminating the plasma environment;
              and (3) it measures the wall temperature and erosion.  The objectives of this
              project are to develop the sensor, mount it on chambers and to demonstrate that
              the sensor allows the manufacturer to clean the chambers when and only they
              need it, thus optimizing the tradeoff between yield and utilization.  The
              ultimate market size for the wall sensor, based on the number of chambers sold,
              exceeds $100M/year.  The initial market is about $0.5M in 1999, and will grow
              to $90M by 2003.
