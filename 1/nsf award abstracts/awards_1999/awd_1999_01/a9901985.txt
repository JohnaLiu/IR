The Exploratorium will develop "The Electronic Guidebook: 
              Extending Museum Experience Using Networked Handheld Computers."  Through this
              project, the Exploratorium and the Concord Consortium will investigate the use
              of new technologies to enhance the learning experience of science museum
              visitors.  The exponentially increasing availability of portable personal
              computing devices provides an opportunity for science museums to develop new
              ways for visitors to experiment and interact with exhibits.  The partners will
              design and prototype a museum-based "Electronic Guidebook" for visitors. 
              Twenty-five Exploratorium exhibits will be connected to a museum network and
              handheld portable computers through infrared connections.  The target audiences
              for this project are the general public (adults and families) and children in
              the K-12 age range.  The primary disciplinary focus is physics, with a
              secondary focus on mathematics.
