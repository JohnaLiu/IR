A US-Brazil collaborative research proposal between Dr.
              Michael Kaufman University of Florida, Gainsville, FL and Dr. Paulo Roberto
              Mei, Universidade Estadual De Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil for a
              two-year study of refractory intermetallic-based structures having enhanced
              properties where microstructural control is of critical importance. 

The US
              PI will benefit from complementary strengths of his Brazilian counterparts. Dr.
              Mei, for example, is a noted expert in the area of materials processing and has
              considerable amount of specialized equipment which permits state of the art
              materials processing research. Professor Costa e Silva has outstanding skills
              in chemical metallurgy and phase diagram calculations using ThermoCalc.
              Conversely the US PI will offer Brazil considerable expertise in the area of
              transmission electron microscopy as the University of  Florida is well equipped
              to facilitate this study. Further, this collaboration will strengthen US
              institutional ties with an CAPINAS, a Brazilian research institution noted for
              its quality investigations and analysis.

The principle goal of this research
              is basic knowledge of refractory intermetallics. the fundamental work outlined
              here will undoubtedly push the frontiers of refractory metal research.
