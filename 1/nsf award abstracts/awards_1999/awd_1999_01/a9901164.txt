Abstract    :
              Advances in IC fabrication technology make possible complete electronic
systems
              on a single chip. Many such systems-on-a-chip require both digital
and analog
              computation. The analog subsystems interface to the continuous,
external
              world: wireless links, wired networks, sensors, transducers.
Electronic design
              automation technology for the digital subsystems is
relatively robust;
              automation for the analog subsystems is still primitive.
This project is
              developing design automation methods for synthesis and
layout of critical
              analog circuit blocks.  The approach focuses on novel
numerical and
              combinatorial optimization algorithms that can efficiently
search over many
              circuit solution candidates. The goal is to be able to
archive synthesizable
              descriptions of circuits as analog "intellectual
property", thus allowing them
              to be reused and retargeted in new
applications
