Title: Analysis and
              Testing of Concurrent Object-Oriented Software

Due to the popularity of
              object-oriented technology and network applications, the use of concurrent
              object-oriented programs is increasing rapidly. The goal of the project is to
              develop cost-effective techniques for analyzing and testing concurrent
              object-oriented programs. The research focuses on the following problems:
              analysis and testing of a class that contains data shared by multiple
              processes, analysis and testing of a set of classes that define processes
              communicating with each other, and incremental analysis and testing of a
              concurrent object-oriented program. The results of the research can be used to
              improve the reliability of concurrent object-oriented programs and to reduce
              the high cost of validating concurrent object-oriented
programs.
