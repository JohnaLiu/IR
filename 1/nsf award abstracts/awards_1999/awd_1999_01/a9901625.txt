Abstract    :
              This project addresses details of bonding and passivation activity of H in
              semiconductors using vibrational spectroscopy at high pressures. Hydrostatic
              pressure in conjunction with vibrational spectroscopy will be used to provide
              new information and understanding of several hydrogen-containing defect
              complexes in compound semiconductor materials. The pressure dependence of C-H
              stretch modes in InP and GaP will be measured and compared to GaAs.
              Pressure-induced shifts of  local vibrational mode (LVM) frequencies are
              strongly dependent on the local environment of the hydrogen atom. In the
              GaN:Mg,H complex, these experiments will attempt to distinguish between
              bond-centered and antibonding N-H configurations. Local vibrational modes of
              S-H complexes in GaSb will also be investigated. Hall effect measurements will
              be used in the study before and after annealing materials to determine mobility
              and concentration of free carriers.

The project addresses basic research
              issues in a topical area of materials science having potential technological
              relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a
              fundamental level which will be relevant to performance of advanced electronic
              devices/circuits. An important feature of the program is the integration of
              research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and
              technologically significant area.
