Abstract    :
              The early explorers of Antarctica's heroic era erected buildings and brought
              large amounts of supplies to survive the extreme environment during their
              Antarctic exploration.  Huts built by Robert F. Scott during the Discovery
              expedition (1901-1904), Ernest Shackleton and the Nimrod expedition (1908),
              Scott's Terra Nova expedition (1911) and others were abandoned once the
              expedition was over, leaving the buildings and thousands of artifacts behind. 
              Today these historic sites provide a remarkable view into the past.  Furniture,
              scientific apparatus, food stores, and other items are left in the huts as a
              reminder of what everyday life was like for the early explorers.  The extreme
              polar environment has protected many of the artifacts from rapid decay but over
              the past 8 to 9 decades, deterioration has become increasingly more prevalent. 
              This joint US-New Zealand project will examine issues related to preservation
              of historic huts in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica. The US scientific effort
              will identify the cause of the deterioration present in the wooden structures,
              determine the current condition of the wood and obtain a better understanding
              of the unique biological and non-biological degradation processes responsible
              for the deterioration.  An assessment of the wood destroying microorganisms
              present will be made and their mode of action during the short summer months of
              activity determined.  Micromorphological investigations using scanning and
              transmission electron microscopy, X-ray microanalyses and chemical analyses
              will be used to study the different types of deterioration found.  The results
              from these investigations will provide needed information that is crucial to
              develop successful conservation plans for the long-term preservation of the
              buildings, wooden materials and other historic artifacts left by the early
              explorers of Antarctica.
