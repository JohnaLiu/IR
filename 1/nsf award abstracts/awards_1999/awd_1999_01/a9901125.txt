	The 1999 Seminar on Stochastic Processes will be held at the
              Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences, Toronto, Canada from
              March 18 to 20, 1999. The seminars have become one of the most important
              regular seminar series for probabilists. They attract and bring together an
              active group of eminent researchers and young specialists in probability and
              stochastic processes. This award will provide travel support for US
              participants. The funds will be used primarily for women and junior
              researchers.
