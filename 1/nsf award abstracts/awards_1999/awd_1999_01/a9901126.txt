Abstract    :
              This meeting represents an opportunity to bring together, for the first time,
              two largely distinct groups whose research efforts have been aimed at a common
              topic for many years.  That topic is membrane transport, particularly within
              the secretory and endocytotic pathways.  Membrane transport can be regarded as
              a two-sided coin.  One side is being studied by traditional membrane
              "traffickers".  The work of this group has been focused on the identification
              and characterization of regulatory factors for the budding and excision of
              transport intermediates from donor membranes, and the targeting, docking and
              fusion of those intermediates to acceptor membranes.  Well known examples of
              factors involved in these processes include COPs, SNAPs, SNAREs, NSF and a
              variety of GTPases.  The other side of the membrane transport coin is being
              investigated by "motorists".  This group has been primarily concerned with the
              cytoskeletal structures, molecular motors and linker proteins that control how
              endomembrane compartments are spatially organized within the cytoplasm, and
              serve as highways along which transport vesicles move between donor and
              acceptor compartments.   Most work in this area has focused on microtubules,
              and motor proteins of the kinesin and dynein families, but recent studies have
              also emphasized the importance of microfilaments and myosin motors in membrane
              transport.  The development of a comprehensive understanding of membrane
              transport will require integration of data obtained both by the traffickers and
              the motorists.  The primary goal of the meeting, therefore, is to bridge the
              gap of understanding and appreciation that presently separates the two groups. 
              Bringing together traffickers and motorists at the same place and time will
              provide an unprecedented opportunity for exchange of information and
              cross-fertilization of ideas in the rapidly progressing field of membrane
              transport.
