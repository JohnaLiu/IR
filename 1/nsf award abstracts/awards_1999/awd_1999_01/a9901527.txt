Abstract    :
              Two communities coexist in the parallel compilation field:
instruction-level
              parallelism (targeted at multiple functional units within
a CPU), and
              parallelization of sequential loops (usually targeted at
multiple processors).
               The goals and techniques used in these
subdisciplines are strongly related,
              yet different, and there is
surprisingly little interaction between them. 
              During the week of April
19-23, 1999 a workshop on instruction-level
              parallelism and loop
parallelization will be held at the International
              conference and Research
Center for Computer Science (IBFI) at Dagstuhl Castle
              in Wadern, Germany.
The workshop will bring together about forty active
              researchers from the
two camps.  The intention of the workshop is to stimulate
              intellectual
ferment by presentation of new results and comparison of these
              two
approaches to parallelism.  The workshop's format will make it possible
              for
participants to give more in-depth presentations than is customary
              at
conferences.  Presentations may include demonstrations of working
              systems
or prototypes.  Attendees will include researchers from the United
              States
and Europe, comprising many well-known names in the
              parallelization
community. This proposal requests funds to cover the
              transatlantic airfare
and registration for participants from the United
              States.
