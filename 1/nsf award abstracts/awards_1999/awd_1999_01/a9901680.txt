Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is
              concerned with wafer-to-wafer transfer that enables the batch assembly of
              microstructures onto a target wafer.  MEMS sense elements may be bonded
              directly onto CMOS, using micro-bump bonding.  Parasitics are reduced,
              potentially eliminating the need for monolithic integration of interface
              electronics.  Micromachined package lids may also be transferred and sealed
              over MEMS structures.  This enables wafer-at-a-time hermetic packaging,
              potentially reducing costs by two orders of magnitude.  In contrast to
              monolithic approaches, the transfer process harvests structures from a finished
              wafer and "grafts' them to a target substrate.  This enables modularization of
              MEMS, electronics, and packaging technology.  A number of process compatibility
              problems are eliminated, product development should be accelerated.  The
              process is performed at room temperature, ensuring wide compatibility across
              substrates and processes.
     The proposed work addresses a $1.2 billion
              market.  Applications include: packaging of MEMS-based RF filters (IF, MHz,
              GHz); fabrication and packaging of surface-micromachined resonators
              (replacement for quartz oscillator in wristwatches, computers, etc.); and
              hermetic/vacuum packaging for low-cost inertial
sensors (disk drive vibration
              compensation).
