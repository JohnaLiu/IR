This proposal requests support for the Experimental High Energy
              Physics group at New York University to participate in two major experimental
              programs: The MILAGRO Gamma Ray Observatory, which is a large water Cherenkov
              counter built in a mountain top artificial pond at an altitude of 2650 meters
              at Fenton Hill, New Mexico,  and the MECO experiment proposed for Brookhaven
              National Laboratory to search for lepton flavor violating processes,
              specifically, muon to electron conversion, at an unprecedented level of
              precision, which will test the predictions of supersymmetric grand unified
              extensions of the Standard Model or will result in a fundamental new discovery.
               In addition, the group has been involved in Run I of the D0 experiment at
              Fermilab, but it is proposed not to participate in Run II, so this activity is
              being phased out.
