Dry snow is a porous material consisting of a complex
              aggregate of interlocking ice grains, air, and water vapor.  Snow is an
              important component of the earth's climate, hydrological, and ecological
              systems, and consequently thermodynamic processes within snow have implications
              for understanding many greater problems such as climate reconstruction and
              snow-melt hydrology.  The size, shape, and arrangement of bonded grain gives
              snow a complex and anisotropic structural texture.  The geometry of this
              texture has been poorly documented with observation.  The movement of heat and
              mass through snow is, therefore, currently difficult to estimate and model. 
              The fellowship will address these issues through three main avenues of
              research: (1) observational investigations of the three-dimensional structure
              of snow, (2) documentation of the modes and heterogeneity of heat and mass flux
              within the observed three-dimensional framework, and (3) testing and
              improvement of models for thermodynamic processes by comparisons with
              observations.  These objectives will be attained through field, laboratory, and
              computer modeling work to be conducted at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine
              Research and the Mountain Research Station, both at the University.
