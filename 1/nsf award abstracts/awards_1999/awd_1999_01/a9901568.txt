This group proposes a research program at the BaBar detector,
              at which a major new experiment to study electron-positron collisions is
              planned. In particular, the group is contributing to a novel device for
              particle identification: a Detector of Internally Reflected Cherenkov light
              (DIRC).  They will also emphasize decays of D's from B-mesons and study
              accelerator backgrounds in PEP II, a novel, asymmetric machine.
