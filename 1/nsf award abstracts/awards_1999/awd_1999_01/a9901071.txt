The Triveni
              project

The Triveni Project is concerned with the domain of software systems
              that include concurrency and reactivity, mobility and distribution, as
              exemplified by virtual simulations of air traffic control and collections of
              digital network devices.  This proposal addresses the design (based on a
              process-algebraic application programming interface that combines threads,
              mobility, distribution, and events), semantics (of concurrency, mobility and
              fairness) and implementation (based on extant implementations of threads,
              events, and frameworks for mobility and distribution) of programming languages
              in this domain.  The ideas developed in the research will be tested by using
              Triveni to build a domain specific language for the simulation and control of
              mobile concurrent systems with subcomponents that are hybrid systems.
