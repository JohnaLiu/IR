A
              program to develop and characterize new processes for the partial oxidation of
              small alkanes directly into chemicals at short contact times and high
              temperatures will be carried out.  Particular projects involve: (1) new
              techniques for rapid catalyst screening by adding catalyst directly onto the
              high temperature catalyst with instantaneous measurement of performance
              changes, (2) use of catalyst deposited directly onto parallel plates to achieve
              efficient heat transfer in very short time reactors and to run exothermic and
              endothermic reactions on opposite sides of a plate, (3) use of stratified and
              staged monolith reactors, and (4) new methods to obtain oxygenates directly by
              exploiting homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions by control of geometry, flow
              patterns, catalysts, and heat transfer in short contact time configurations. 
              This project involves the interplay of heterogeneous catalysis and homogeneous
              reactions along with reaction engineering issues to understand and develop new
              processes for the partial oxidation of light alkanes in small reactors at short
              contact times under conditions of very high reaction rates where the gradients
              in temperature and concentrations are extremely large.
