Abstract    :
              This project will organize and hold the 2ns International Workshop on Structural
              Health Monitoring at Stanford University, September 8-10, 1999.  Structural
              health monitoring is an emerging technology, which combines advanced sensing
              technology with a knowledge of material/structural damage characteristics to
              monitor the condition of structures in real time while in service.

The
              objective of the workshop are to review the progress of the current rapid
              technological development in the field, to identify key and emerging issues in
              research and development, and to promote exchanges and cross-fertilization
              among many disciplines and these applications, such as rotorcraft and aircraft
              structures, civil infrastructures, vehicle and marine structures, and hazard
              mitigation.

Key and distinguished individuals from industry, academe, and
              government will be invited to give keynote lectures and presentations in the
              workshop.  Product and technology demonstrations will also be conducted.  The
              workshop will conclude with panel discussions on key issues and concerns to be
              identified during the workshop.  The workshop will result in proceedings
              containing the presentations of the workshop.  Appropriate guidelines and
              recommendations for government agencies and industry to promote structural
              health monitoring development will be developed.
