     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              is directed toward innovative manufacturing technology to deposit durable,
              scratch resistant, optical coatings on polycarbonate plastic substrates in
              large volume and at a low production cost. The basis of this innovation is a
              patented and proprietary Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) process
              for thin film coatings. CCVD is an open atmosphere flame-based process, which
              can easily be scaled to coat large surfaces and complex shapes without the need
              for a vacuum chamber or reaction vessel. The environmentally safe CCVD process
              can be adapted for continuous production line deposition, enabling economies of
              scale in high volume manufacturing. The proposer plans to build on a Phase I
              effort in developing scratch-resistant, durable, high quality optical coatings
              on polycarbonate, which are intended for automotive and architectural
              applications. The proposer is aligned in this SBIR project with a Fortune
              100-size manufacturer of polycarbonate plastic and has also recruited a leading
              U.S manufacturer of coating and adhesive precursor chemicals to participate in
              Phase II. Both of these industrial companies have committed to provide in-kind
              cost share to the Phase II effort. Each will partner with the proposer in Phase
              III commercialization of successful technical results.
     Scratch resistant
              optical coatings on polycarbonate will enable new products to replace glass in
              automotive and architectural applications. These products will enable lighter
              weight vehicles, shatter proof windows and improved thermal and optical
              performance.
