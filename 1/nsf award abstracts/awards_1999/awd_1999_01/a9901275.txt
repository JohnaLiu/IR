In several primarily Hispanic, low socio-economic school
              districts of the southwest in partnership with local institutions of higher
              learning, this 48-month project will develop programs and materials to attract
              parents of children of all grade levels and make them active supporters of a
              system that promotes good mathematical learning for their children.  These
              programs and materials will help them become aware of what is happening in
              their children's classroom; offer them occasions to take on leadership roles in
              working with teachers, administrators, and other parents; and provide them
              opportunities for in-depth experiences with school mathematics.  The materials
              will be initially developed and piloted in the Sunnyside School District. 
              After revision from the pilot project, the project will be implemented in
              several other school districts.
