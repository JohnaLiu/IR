Abstract    :
              Partial travel support for keynote speakers, reduced registration for graduate
              students, and organizational costs to the "Third Particle Image Velocimetry
              (PIV) Workshop" (Santa Barbara, CA, September 16-18, 1999) has been awarded. 
              The workshop is structured to promote exchange of ideas concerning the theory
              and practice of PIV and particle tracking velocimetry (PTV), provide a
              comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art, and develop scientific
              interactions of US researchers with experts from Europe and Japan. 
              Simultaneous point measurements of the velocity in two- or three-dimensional
              fields, as well as of temperature and concentration, would improve
              understanding of fluid flow phenomena.  Typical applications include
              turbulence, multi-phase, micro-scale, high-speed, and biomedical flows.  Many
              aspects of these techniques require further refinement and enhanced
              understanding to fully realize their potential.  Holding the Workshop in the US
              will significantly aid the exposure of our experimental community to the most
              recent developments and it will provide exposure for our researchers to
              establish contacts with international colleagues.
