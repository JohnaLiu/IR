Abstract    :
              
This research focuses on the development, analysis and implementation of fast
              and memory-efficient algorithms 
for solving several matrix computation
              problems arising from information retrieval and data mining.  The singular
              value decomposition (SVD) of large and/or sparse matrices plays an essential
              role in this research: it is used, on the one hand, for dimension reduction to
              achieve high algorithmic efficiency, and on the other for noise reduction to
              improve retrieval accuracy.  The emphasis is on exploring the intrinsic
              structures of the matrices arising from those applications to develop fast
              algorithms for their SVD computation. 

Specifically, the goals of this
              research are 1) the development of theoretical foundation for latent semantic
              indexing (LSI) and related spectral analytical methods for information
              retrieval, hypertext link analysis and data mining; 
2) the development and
              implementation of high performance algorithms for partial SVD and sparse
              low-rank approximation computation that can scale to very large text corpora
              and databases.
A subspace-based statistical model has been previously
              developed to represent the 
relations between terms and latent concepts.  This
              model has led to a "low-rank-plus-shift" structure that is approximately
              satisfied by the cross-product of the term-document matrices. 
This structure
              gives rise to a more accurate updating scheme for LSI and it also leads to a
              highly parallel divide-and-conquer method for computing the partial SVD of
              large sparse term-document matrices. 
This project will 1)  further develop
              our subspace-based model and gain deeper understanding of the 
effectiveness
              of partial SVD and their sparse variations in text retrieval, link analysis and
              data mining 
applications; 2) further explore the low-rank-plus-shift
              structures of the term-document matrices and link matrices 
to develop fast
              and memory-efficient numerical algorithms for the computation of their partial
              SVD in linear time; 
3) explore other efficient heuristics for finding dense
              bipartite subgraphs used in Web link analysis and data mining applications; and
              4) test the algorithms on text corpora generated from WWW and large commercial
              databases.

No computation of SVD on the order of several million has been
              attempted before, and LSI, data mining applications and link analysis for WWW
              provides a perfect platform to investigate algorithmic issues and parallel
              implementation issues for large-scale computation.  This research attempts to
              integrate theoretical investigation based on statistics and matrix perturbation
              theory, algorithmic development using computational linear algebra
              methodologies, and experimentation on real-world text corpora and large
              datasets obtained from WWW search engines and large commercial databases.
