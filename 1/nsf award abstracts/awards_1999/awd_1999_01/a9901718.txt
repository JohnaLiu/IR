Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at the
              development of a process for the growth of Pb(Zn1/3,Nb2/3)03-PbTiO3 (PZN-PT)
              and Pb(Mg,1/3Nb2/3)03-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) ferrorelaxor single crystals from
              high-temperature solutions (fluxes).  PZN-PT and PMN-PT single crystals have
              unique properties that include very high coupling coefficients (>90%), large
              dielectric constants (1000-5000), low dielectric loss (<0.01), and
              exceptionally high piezoelectric coefficients (d33 > 2000 pC/N).  These
              properties have established PZN-PT and PMN-PT as very attractive materials for
              low frequency acoustic transduction, ultrasonic biomedical imaging and
              actuation.  However, large and good quality single crystals of PMN-PT and
              PZN-PT are not commercially available because of the lack of a growth
              technique.  Two modifications of a growth process will be developed in Phase
              II, namely Immersion Seeded Solution Growth (ISSG) and Top Seeded Solution
              Growth (TSSG).  As-grown crystals will be characterized and prototype
              multilayer stacked actuators will be fabricated and tested.
     Potential
              commercial applications of PZN-PT and PMN-PT single crystals will include
              piezoelectric devices with improved characteristics for defense, medical and
              electronic industries.  In particular, they will be used in acoustic
              transducers, hydrophones, ultrasound sensors for biomedical imaging and
              electromechanical actuators for micropositioners and micro-motors.
