Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II award is to
              continue development of an avalanche photodiode for use as a high gain photon
              imaging device. Phase II of this project includes the development of device
              structures optimized for two applications in low light level imaging: a single
              optical photon imaging device that generates the time and position of incidence
              for each detected optical photon event, and a scintillator coupled device that
              provides time and position of incidence information for high energy photons
              captured in an array of scintillator blocks. The imaging avalanche photodiode
              promises a lower cost, wider dynamic range alternative to microchannel plate
              based single photon imaging detectors and will provide data in a format that is
              more conducive to rapid analysis than traditional image files. Applications for
              the device include
 a variety of emerging techniques for real time in-vivo
              imaging of physiological and developmental processes such as reporter gene
              activity, calcium dynamics and free radical production using luminescent
              indicators. When coupled to a scintillator block array, the imaging avalanche
              photodiode promises a lower cost, smaller detector module than current
              photomultiplier-based approaches for compact geometry gamma ray imaging
              applications, with the added feature of being able to operate in high magnetic
              fields.
     The imaging avalanche photodiodes (IAPD) will lead to the
              commercialization of a number of important, affordable instruments both for
              basic research as well as diagnostic screening. In addition to facilitating
              luminescence-based research, the IAPD will enable a more robust approach to
              gamma ray imaging for PET and dual use modalities.
