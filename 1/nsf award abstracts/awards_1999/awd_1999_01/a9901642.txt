The research project is directed towards creating innovative
              low-density structural titanium alloys.  Phase I of the program is process
              oriented, aimed at incorporating low-density magnesium into titanium using two
              non-equilibrium methods of alloying, mechanical alloying and physical vapor
              deposition.  The goal is to extend the solid solubility of Mg in the Ti-Mg
              alloy system; an additional consideration is the effects of incorporating other
              lightweight elements (aluminum, silicon, and scandium) into the alloys.  Once
              the processing has extended the solid solubility in the precursor material, the
              alloys are compacted using low temperature techniques that attempt to avoid
              excessive phase coarsening.  The microstructure is characterized at various
              stages of the research with particular interest in dispersions of second phase
              precipitates that might occur.  If the research in Phase I is successful, Phase
              II looks toward scaling up the process to create larger amounts of the
              promising alloys for analysis.
%%%
Titanium alloys are attractive for
              structural applications because of their high specific strength, excellent
              environmental resistance, and good fracture-related behavior (fracture
              toughness and fatigue crack growth rate).  This work could lead to the
              development of a new family of low-density structural titanium alloys with
              major impact on the transformation industries.
