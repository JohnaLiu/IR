Abstract    :
              The stretching of the Earth's magnetic field in the direction opposite the sun
              produces a region where there is a thin sheet of electric current.  The
              dynamics of this thin current sheet is of critical importance to our
              understanding of magnetospheric substorms.  This research program will examine
              the stability and dynamics of the current sheet using numerical solution
              techniques for analytic equations.  Because the study involves using analytic
              equations they can be done much more quickly than by using hybrid or particle
              simulation codes.  The models developed using these techniques have the
              potential to be used in the development of the Geospace General Circulation
              Model (GGCM), which is one of the primary goals of the Geospace Environment
              Modeling (GEM) program
