Abstract    :
              This workshop is intended to bring together a distinguished group of research
              scientists/educators and industry experts to explore the role of
              wireless/tetherless communications in the global economy of the future, and to
              develop recommendations for future research and development.  The goal of the
              meeting is to provide answers to the question, "What research needs to be done
              to achieve full T3 via the wireless medium by 200X?"
