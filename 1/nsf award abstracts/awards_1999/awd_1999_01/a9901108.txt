"Mechanism-Based Analysis for Electrokinetically-Enhanced
              Aggregate Remediation" 


Although electrokinetic processes have been used
              in Geotechnical applications for many years, their use in remediation is
              relatively new.  Electrokinetics can be used to induce fluid flow, induce ion
              migration without fluid flow, or induce particle migration.  There are at least
              two situations where electrokinetic remediation can offer advantages over
              alternative strategies.  Electromobility may enhance the remediation of "old
              contamination" soils (soils that have been contaminated for decades) because
              these soils offer unusual resistance to mass transfer from the solid phase. 
              Electro-osmosis may have advantages in remediating low permeability soil where
              site hydrology precludes inducing flow hydraulically.   

This research
              project will study the individual processes that occur during electrokinetic
              remediation.  Experimental research will focus on this separation of
              electrochemical phenomena, and will quantify the individual mechanisms
              responsible for electrokinetically-enhanced remediation of "old contamination" 
              soils.  Mathematical modeling results and experimental analyses will be used to
              develop techniques to measure the parameters required for practical remediation
              design.  Screening methods will be devised to help engineers and scientists
              identify soils for which this remediation process would be most effective. 
              Results will be combined into a design tool that will help engineers analyze
              the potential benefits of applying electrokinetic processes to enhance
              remediation. 
  
The research will make contributions to both the fundamental
              understanding of electrokinetically-enhanced remediation, and the application
              of this knowledge to practical remediation design.  The methods and procedures
              developed will allow engineers to determine when electrokinetic phenomena offer
              competitive advantages over remediation alternatives.
