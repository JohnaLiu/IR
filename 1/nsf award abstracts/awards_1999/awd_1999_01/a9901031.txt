An Approach
              to the Automatic Generation of Software Functional
Architectures

System
              models for the reliability assessment of software are an important component of
              the current reliability research. One of these models, proposed by the PI, uses
              as its basic modeling component, a functional architecture derived from the
              software specifications. The derivation of the architecture from these
              specifications is currently performed manually by a knowledgeable analyst. The
              aim of this proposal is to investigate the feasibility of an approach to the
              automatic derivation of the software functional architecture. The approach
              proposed combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and constrained
              grammars. The benefit of this research will be to automatically create the
              functional architecture used in software engineering. An additional benefit is
              that the architecture can be used as input to tools for model-based automated
              black box testing and hence the automatic translation should help relieve some
              of the burden and potential for error encountered in functional testing. This
              research will impact the fields of software engineering, software reliability,
              safety and security, and software testing. It will also support the education
              of graduate students and increase the visibility of woman-led research.
