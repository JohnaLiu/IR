Abstract    :
              This project will explore how the local environment of a photoreactive molecule
              affects its spectral properties and its observed photoreactivity.  A variety of
              substrates will be studied in environments that include adsorption on one of
              several solid materials, in supercritical fluids, or as deposited on
              semiconductors and organic coatings.  Results from these studies will provide
              fundamental insight into the influence that structure has on long-range
              electronic coupling and in turn, how these interactions dictate the optical and
              physical properties of supramolecular arrays.

With this Award, the Organic
              and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues to support the research of
              Professor Marye Ann Fox of North Carolina State University.  The research that
              Professor Fox is carrying out studies the effects that a molecule's environment
              has on its photochemistry, such as when individual molecules in a sensory
              device interact with light.   A thorough understanding of these effects is
              important in the context of nanotechnology and optical computers, in addition
              to providing significant new contributions to the underlying science
              involved.
