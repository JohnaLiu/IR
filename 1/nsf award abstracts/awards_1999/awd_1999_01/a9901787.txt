Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project has as its
              overall objective, the development and demonstration of a thin film, II3V2
              based Thermophotovoltaic power generator.  The major portion of the effort will
              be devoted to the further improvement of low cost II3V2 based thin film
              hertojunction devices grown by organo-metallic chemical vapor deposition
              (MOCVD).  In addition, mono lithic - interconnected modules will be developed
              as well as the special optical coatings needed for high performance. 
     At
              the conclusion of the program, it is planned to demonstrate a fully operational
              working prototype product.  Contact with strategic partners and investors has
              already begun and will continue to mature during the Phase II program.
