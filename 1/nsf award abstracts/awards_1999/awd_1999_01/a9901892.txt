The Astronomical Society of the Pacific requests $1,348,428
              to enhance the dissemination of Project ASTRO in communities by building new
              capability into an existing network to serve the "whole family".  Family ASTRO
              will consist of the following components:

Six Family Astronomy Kits, in
              English and Spanish, each consisting of a suite of hands-on activities that can
              be done with simple materials that are available to a wide range of families. 
              All families will have the capability to perform these activities.

A Family
              Astronomy Events Manual to help partners and site leaders use star parties,
              Sun, Moon, and Shadows sessions, and other larger group astronomy events into
              the project.

Training protocols and materials at three levels:  to train the
              families in doing astronomy activities directly, to train the
              astronomy/teachers partners to work with families and to train regional site
              leaders on the best ways to work with their local partners to start their own
              Family ASTRO program.

The project will have a strong focus on families of
              underserved populations in science by continuing the work of Project ASTRO
              sites in urban areas such as Chicago and San Francisco, and in rural areas like
              southern New Mexico.
