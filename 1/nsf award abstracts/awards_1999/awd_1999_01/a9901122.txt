Abstract    :
              This grant is for partial support of a conference on Phospholipase D (PLD),
              sponsored  by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
              (FASEB), to be held in Vermont August 14-19,1999.  The core of speakers were
              selected on the basis of their 
ongoing contributions to the knowledge of the
              genetics, structure, regulation and function of PLD.   One hour of each session
              will be reserved for brief presentations by post-doctoral fellows and graduate
              students. This conference will bring together participants from different
              disciplines who share a common interest in PLD.  No previous meeting has been
              devoted exclusively to PLD, and this conference will serve as a forum to assess
              the field.  With the recent cloning of multiple PLD isoforms and  the
              availability of new reagents and techniques, major advances in this area should
              occur.  Thus, the primary purpose of this meeting is to bring together a
              diverse group of investigators with various scientific backgrounds to share
              ideas, perspectives and techniques which will advance the field.
