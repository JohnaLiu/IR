Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of Michigan
              supports the research of Professor Larry W. Beck.  The theme of the research is
              the investigation of the mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis processes through
              the design and synthesis of tailored materials and in-situ NMR characterization
              of the active catalyst.  Initial target projects of this research include
              acid-catalyzed addition reactions using aluminum and boron zeolites and partial
              oxidation catalysis using titanium zeolites.  Triple-resonance NMR techniques
              that explore dipole-dipole distances will be used to investigate the local
              structure of catalytic active sites under reaction conditions.  NMR will also
              be used to follow catalysis reactions in situ to identify key kinetic and
              thermodynamic properties of the mechanism.

Many existing routes to the
              synthesis and manufacture of fine chemicals employ hazardous reagents, generate
              large amounts of waste, and are often inefficient.  Finding alternative
              environmentally benign processes using catalysts is a concern and growing
              priority in industry.  The mechanistic information gained in this project will
              be used to investigate possible new routes to important chemical
              intermediates.
