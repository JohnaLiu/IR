Abstract    :
              The everyday life behaviors of nearly any contemporary population exhibit a
              grouped distribution, and the majority of any locale's population seems to
              divide into a relatively small number of very distinct groups. This doctoral
              dissertation research will: (1) assess the extent to which a local population
              is partitioned into distinct groups within which behavior is broadly similar;
              (2) evaluate the utility of existing, attributional models and concepts for
              explaining why persons are or are not broadly similar with respect to their
              everyday behaviors; and (3) propose and test an explanation for shared cluster
              membership derived from social network principles. Data will be collected using
              a population survey of the social networks and everyday behaviors in a small
              town, and analyzed using network positional methods to assess behavioral
              similarity. The potential findings and method offered here challenge current
              assumptions about social stratification and identity and may also suggest a new
              approach to the analysis of market segmentation. This study is expected to
              reveal stronger distinctions within a local population than those suggested by
              prevailing stratification models, which do not focus on local contexts, and
              show the importance of specific social relations for everyday behavioral
              differentiation, while controlling for a variety of individual attributes often
              regarded as relevant. This research will also create one of the largest data
              sets on interpersonal social networks available to date.
