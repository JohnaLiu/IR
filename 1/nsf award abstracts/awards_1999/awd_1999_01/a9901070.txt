Abstract    :
              This project is a companion to ATM-9900983 (PI: F. Toffoletto).  The two
              proposals taken together are designed to produce a computer model of the
              Earth's magnetotail and how the tail interacts with the inner magnetosphere. 
              It will couple the tail-MHD computer code of Birn and Hesse with the Rice
              Convection Model and a magnetofriction code.  The model will solve a closed set
              of partial differential equations which describe the magnetotail and the plasma
              sheet and their coupling to the inner magnetosphere and ionosphere.  Ultimately
              this computer code will be used as a module for the Geospace General
              Circulation Model (GGCM), which is one of the primary goals of the Geospace
              Environment Modeling (GEM) program
