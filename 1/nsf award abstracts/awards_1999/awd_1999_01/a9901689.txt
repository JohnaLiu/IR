This project investigates
              machine-independent program representations 
for mobile-code applications.
              Existing approaches have been based on 
abstract machines: each program is
              encoded as a linear sequence of 
"byte-codes" in the instruction set of the
              virtual machine. This 
research instead focuses on hierarchical, graph-based
              formats that 
are able to preserve the high-level semantics of the original
              source
program to a much higher degree than linear representations. This
              
becomes particularly important when dealing with explicit
              source-level
parallelism in high-performance software: transporting such
              programs 
via a representation without hierarchical constructs implies
              
sequentialization when the source code is compiled, and possibly 
a
              subsequent re-parallelization in the eventual native-code generator. 
This is
              not only costly, but very likely to lead to a loss of 
efficiency. Moreover,
              hierarchical encoding schemes promise to 
directly and space-efficiently
              encode most of the control-flow 
and data-flow information necessary for
              advanced code optimizations, 
as well as provide for simpler verification of
              mobile-code security. 
Lastly, preliminary evidence suggests that hierarchical
              solutions 
scale better to large programs than solutions based on linear
              
byte-code streams for abstract machines.
