Abstract    :
              This award supports some of the cost of a national workshop on
              advanced
networking middleware.  There are three goals for the workshop: (a)
              development of
an acceptable definition for the concept of "networking
              middleware," (b)
identification of core components for a networking
              middleware
infrastructure "layer," and (c) identification of needed research
              related
to components and to their involvement in a networking testbed. 
              Though
results will be of benefit to many in the research community, the
              workshop
report will be of particular use to the Advanced Network
              Infrastructure
program at NSF in its deliberations about future advanced
              networking programs.
