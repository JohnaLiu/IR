The main objective of this research is to design and
              develop a typed common intermediate format (named FLINT) for multiple advanced
              programming languages.  FLINT is based on an extended variant of the
              polymorphic lambda calculus Fomega.  Although advanced languages can be very
              different in semantics, they all have a mathematically rigorous type system.
              FLINT provides a common compiler backend that can be quickly adapted to  
              generate compilers for new languages.  With its unified type system, FLINT
              serves as a great platform for reasoning about cross-language interoperations.
              Previous work on FLINT was done in the context of ML. This proposed research
              will extend FLINT to support other language features such as classes and
              objects in Java, type dynamic in Scheme, lazy evaluation and type classes in
              Haskell, and various system-programming primitives in C and Modula-3.  The goal
              is to achieve safe, principled, and fine-grain language interoperation between
              different advanced languages and with C and assembly code.
