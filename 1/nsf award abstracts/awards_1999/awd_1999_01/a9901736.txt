Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result
              in development of a real-time sensor for monitoring the carbon monoxide (CO)
              concentration in the reformate feed to a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell
              used to power an electric vehicle.  Monitoring of the CO concentration is
              required to prevent performance degradation of the fuel cell.  The Phase II
              program will extend the CO in reformate measurement technique, demonstrated in
              Phase I, to a miniature, low-cost, rugged sensor suitable for electric
              vehicles.  The unique approach for electrochemical detection of CO consists of
              adsorption of CO on the working electrode, electrochemical consumption of the
              bulk hydrogen (H2), and a subsequent voltammetric sweep to oxidize the CO
              adsorbed on the electrode surface.  The CO oxidation current is proportional to
              the CO concentration in the reformate sample.  The major focus of this program
              will be to develop a miniaturized sensor cell and an improved electrochemical
              H2 consumption process to reduce the response time.  The program goal will be
              to demonstrate detection of CO levels of 1ppm to greater than 1000 ppm with a
              response time of 10 seconds and an ultimate goal of 1 second time. The program
              will culminate in the fabrication and demonstration of a low volume, fast
              response sensor for detection of CO in a reformate.                            
                
     The primary application will be fuel-cell-powered electric vehicles,
              which have the potential for a very large market considering the requirements
              for low-emission vehicles.  Other applications include fuel cells for
              stationary power production.
