Abstract    :
              The project is aimed at providing a better understanding of the geometry of the
              central paths for linear programming problems, the paths that are followed by
              interior-point methods.  The motivation for better understanding the geometry
              is the hope that it might be useful in resolving a major open problem in
              optimization, namely, whether or not a genuinely polynomial algorithm exists. 
              It might be possible to design such an algorithm by extending interior-point
              ideas, the extensions requiring a deeper understanding of the geometry than
              presently exists.

Another aim is to develop an efficient symbolic method for
              making queries regarding the exact optimal solutions of semi-definite
              programming problems.  Interior-point methods only approximate the optimal
              solutions, so in general do not suffice to answer such queries.

The research
              is expected to make the most mathematical interior-point method theory (for
              general convex optimization) more cohesive, as well as more accessible to
              researchers in related areas.  It is hoped that by focusing on the geometry
              underlying interior-point methods --- in particular, focusing on the inner
              products induced by the barrier functions --- the advanced theory can be made
              more transparent and better motivated to Ph.D. students and outside
              researchers.
