Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              demonstrate prototypes of a new class of very broad band, wide dynamic range
              seismometers using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) feedback and spectrum translation.
               The new instruments will be based on proven molecular electronic technology
              (MET), with force balancing feedback provided by the MHD effect on the
              electrolyte, which serves as the inertial mass.  Radical noise reduction will
              be achieved via the use of signal modulation to produce spectrum translation. 
              The goal is an instrument equal in performance to the best extant seismometers,
              while retaining the other desirable features of MET seismic sensors: low cost,
              low power, ruggedness, and manufacturability in volume production.
     These
              seismometers are expected to compete in all applications currently employing
              top-of-the-line traditional seismometers.  Generally, this means scientific
              studies and monitoring in earthquake seismology.  They will also be used in
              large sensor network applications, where ruggedness and small size and weight
              make them particularly attractive in boreholes and on the ocean bottom.
