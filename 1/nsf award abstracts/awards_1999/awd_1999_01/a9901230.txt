The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide support for a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Scott Crass to work with Dr. Sebastian van
              Strien at the Mathematics Institute of the University of Warwick in Coventry,
              United Kingdom.  NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences'
              Office of Multidisciplinary Activities is providing half of the funding for
              this project.
This project involves the study of the dynamics of maps with the
              symmetries of symmetric and alternating groups.  Crass's work centers on
              complex algebraic dynamical systems with large symmetry groups.  His research
              relates classical Galois theory and the geometry of simple groups to real and
              complex analytic dynamics.  Of particular interest to him, is the interplay
              between the rich geometric structure and the global dynamics.

Dr. van
              Strien's group at Warwick is very active in the field of dynamical systems. 
              His group includes Tan Lei, Anthony Manning, and Oleg Kozlovsky.
