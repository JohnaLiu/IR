The Science Museum of Minnesota will develop "Exploring
              Time," a 4,000 square-foot traveling exhibition, related educational materials,
              and a public website.  Exploring Time will engage visitors in experiences about
              the natural world that reveal their own abilities to see change over time and
              to help them see the world in a new way.  Through the use of computers,
              multimedia technology, science apparatus and real objects, visitors will be
              able to explore the vast world of phenomena that happen too quickly or too
              slowly for humans to perceive.  Vignettes of scientists from a broad array of
              disciplines will highlight currrent research, show scientists as role models
              for young people, and demonstrate how compressing and expanding time is a
              conceptual technique used in many fields of scientific endeavor.  Interactive
              experiments that challenge human perception of time and duration will make
              personal for visitors their limits and compel them to ask questions scientists
              do:  How can I know about changes that happen outside my perceptions?  The
              exhibition will open at the Science Museum of Minnesota in October, 2001, and
              then tour to 12 to 15 large- and medium-sized museums around the country,
              reaching a projected audience of over 2.5 million.
