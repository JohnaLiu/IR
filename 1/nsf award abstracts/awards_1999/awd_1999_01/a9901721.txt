Martoff
The PI, Martoff,  in collaboration with Snowden-Ifft
              (co-discovered of the principle of the new detector called negative-ion drift
              chamber) and a number of British scientists proposes to build a directional
              recoil identification track detector to search for weakly interacting massive
              particles.  Tests carried out with a prototype version of this detector showed
              that this detector has better background rejection than the current set of
              operating cold matter detectors based on scintillation and cryogenic detectors.
               He proposes to build a 1 cubic meter detector in three years and operate it in
              the Bulby Mine in UK. The sensitivity of this detector is comparable with those
              of the current set of detectors but it will have the director sensing
              capability not present in current detectors.
