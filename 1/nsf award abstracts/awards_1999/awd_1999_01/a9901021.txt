LINDBLOM
The goal of this research is to develop a system for
              measuring the metabolic energy costs of speech movements. The project involves
              building the equipment, testing its feasibility and preliminarily assessing its
              performance on various speech materials. If, as we believe to be the case, it
              is indeed possible to make such measurements reliably and meaningfully, such a
              result would have important implications for linguistics and related fields. It
              bears on the classical notion of 'articultory ease '.

The present project
              will evaluate two different solutions to the measuring of speech energy costs.
              Our first approach is similar to the technique traditionally used by
              experimental biologists in the study of whole body movements. It involves the
              use of an air flow meter and an oxygen concentration analyzer to derive the
              amount of O2 used during the speech task. The other method is expected to
              provide higher resolution. It works by freezing the outgoing breath stream at
              four different temperatures to successively extract water, carbon dioxide,
              oxygen and nitrogen. By comparing the amounts obtained for speech and for rest
              over a certain time period, significant readings should be possible. Our goal
              is to assess the limitations and merits of these two techniques and to obtain
              preliminary information on the feasibility and precision of various
              experimental protocols.
