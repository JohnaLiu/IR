Abstract    :
              This project involves the computational study of the mechanism of hydroxylation
              of saturated hydrocarbons by a variety of oxidants including those that model
              monooxygenases such as P-450.  Further development of previous work will bring
              computational chemistry to bear on the energetics of O-O bond cleavage during
              oxidation reactions.  The relationships between different reaction pathways
              will be examined in a comparative manner that will hopefully provide an all
              encompassing mechanism for such reactions as dioxirane, peroxynitrous acid, and
              iron (III) hydroperoxides.  Monooxygenase models utilize porphyrin iron(III)
              hydroxides and hydrogen peroxide complexes, using multireference
              methods.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              continues support for the research of Professor Robert D. Bach of the
              University of Delaware.  Professor Bach uses computers to model chemical
              reactions in an attempt to learn the precise chain of events that occur.  An
              important reaction and one that Professor Bach focuses on is the oxygenation of
              saturated hydrocarbon molecules -- those that are inert to most chemical
              reactions due to almost exclusive presence of strong C-H and C-C single bonds. 
              This kind of reaction is one way in which petrochemical feedstocks are
              converted into useful oxygen-containing materials such as alcohols.  It also is
              carried out in living organisms by the P-450 enzyme.
