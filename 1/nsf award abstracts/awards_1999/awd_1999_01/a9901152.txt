Abstract    :
              Ultra low power digital logic design can be achieved by operating transistors in
              the sub-threshold region.  The device mimics and ideal constant current source
              for almost the whole VDS range.  For serially connected transistors, the VDS
              drop on each transistor is negligible, which allows the implementation of large
              complex gates.  The design in the sub-threshold region can be subdivided into
              device and circuit issues.  At the device level, scaling issues are being
              investigated.  At the circuit level, robustness, performance-power trade-offs
              and the applicability of circuit design based on various logic families (e.g.
              CMOS, Pseudo-NMOS, Source Coupled Logic, and Differential Current Switch Logic)
              are being studied.  Several logic families are being designed to work
              specifically in the sub-threshold region.  Comparisons with other low power
              design techniques, e.g. adiabatic Quasii-Static CMOS logic, are being made. 
              Methods for noise analysis, including flicker and thermal noised, are being
              explored.
