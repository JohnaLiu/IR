Recent models of mantle convection show that the history of
              plate motions can be partly described by the coupling of plates to mantle
              convection driven by previously subducted slabs.  Because the distribution of
              slabs in the mantle changes only slowly, changes in plate motion that occur on
              time scales of a few million years must be due to some other dynamical
              component of the plate-mantle system.  The PI will investigate the role of
              plate bounding forces that may occur at subduction zones and transform faults. 
              Models of mantle convection that include such forces should yield predictions
              of changes in plate velocity, dynamic stresses, and the distribution of density
              in the mantle.  These predictions can be tested against data from geological
              observables such as the history of plate motions, observations of stress
              history and uplift, and seismic tomography, and should constrain the role of
              plate bounding forces in the dynamics of mantle convection and plate
              tectonics.
