Title: Climate Record from Corals in the Central and Western Sectors of
              the Tropical South Pacific

The tropical South Pacific region has only been
              sparsely sampled for annually resolved paleoclimatic records of the last
              several centuries.  Historical records of climate in this region are also
              relatively sparse.  This region is however dramatically effected by the
              interannual El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system, and possibly by
              decadal-scale ocean-atmosphere variability.  This award supports the analysis
              of multicentury coral cores from Fiji and Rarotonga in the western and central
              sectors of the South Pacific.  Both sites are positioned near the southern edge
              of the Pacific warm pool within the westward flowing South Equatorial Current,
              and in the region of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ).  This project
              will isotopically analyze the upper 150 years of coral record from both sites
              to examine ENSO-band and decadal variability in these South Pacific gyre
              locations.
