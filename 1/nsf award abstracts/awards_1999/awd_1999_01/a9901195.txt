Abstract    :
              Recent developments in fast integral equations solvers combined
              with
model-order reduction techniques has made it possible to
              automatically
generate reduced-order models directly from 3-D simulation of
              complicated
interconnect. This research is on extending the approach to
              higher
frequency analysis of interconnect, and to multiple-domain
              applications
such as micromachined devices. The topics that will be
              investigated
include: well-conditioned purely surface formulations for wide
              frequency
range full-wave analysis of interconnect, Greens function
              independent fast
solvers for integral formulations, and approaches to
              model-order reduction
based on drawing a connection between the optimal Hankel
              norm reduction
methods used in control theory and the Krylov-subspace methods
              used in
interconnect analysis. This combination of formulation, fast solver,
              and
robust model-order reduction makes it possible to automatically
              generate
macromodels for system-level simulation of a broad set of
              technology.
