This Americas Program award will support Dr. Joseph S.
              Walder, US Geological Survey, in collaboration with Dr. Hugo Moreno,
              Observatorio Volcanologico de los Andes del Sur, on a study to assess
              hydrologic hazards near volcanoes.  The research will be carried out  at the
              Observatorio Volcanologico de los Andes del Sur in Temuco, Chile, which is
              located near several active, snow and ice-covered volcanoes, and not far away
              from hydroelectric dams potentially endangered by lahars (volcanogenic debris
              flows.)  Up to now maps depicting volcano-related hazards have relied on
              historical records and detailed geologic studies to estimate the boundaries of
              hazard zones for future events.  The objective of this work is to understand
              hazardous volcanic phenomena at a fundamental level, and to develop physically
              based models that can be used to make plausible predictions of future hazardous
              events and define hazard zones.  Field investigations will be aimed at making
              observations, focused on developing hazards-assessment methodologies  related
              to the hydrological effects of lava-flow movement over snow and ice.   

With
              his  background in glaciology and hydrology the US PI will develop physically
              based methods for assessing hazards from the lahars entering lakes, while the
              Chilean investigator's expertise in volcanology will provide the necessary
              background information and data from previous eruptions and provide and
              facilitate access to field sites.
