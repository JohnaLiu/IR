Abstract    :
              Portable and high-performance electronic systems need to be designed
              with
low-power consumption criteria. Dynamic power management (DPM) is a
              means
of controlling power consumption levels in portable and
              high-performance
electronic systems. DPM monitors idleness of the system's
              components and
sets them in appropriate states characterized by performance,
              power and
service levels. The project addresses developing design technologies
              to
support DPM. There are four major tasks: 1) Modeling digital systems in
              a
general and abstract way, to capture the power-consumption, performance
              and
service levels, 2) Synthesis of optimal control policies for
              power
management. 3) Implementation of policies, including their embedding
              in
systems compliant with existing standards (e.g., ACPI), 4)
              Experimentation
with DPM policies as applied to electronic portable systems to
              evaluate the
effectiveness of dynamic power management strategies. CAD tools
              for
designing power managers are being developed.
