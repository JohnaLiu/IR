Abstract    :
              This award provides support for postdoctoral associates and graduate students to
              attend the Ninth International Conference on Biological Inorganic Chemistry
              (ICBIC9) to be held July 11-16, 1999, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  The award is
              made to Drs. Marian T. Stankovich and Lawrence Que of the Chemistry Department,
              University of Minnesota, by the NSF Divisions of Chemistry and Molecular and
              Cellular Biosciences.  The purpose of this international conference is to bring
              researchers in biology and biochemistry together with inorganic chemists to
              stimulate collaborations and information exchange among these groups.  Much of
              the conference will focus on metalloenzymes that play important roles in
              metabolism and health.  Sessions will be organized along non-traditional lines
              and include the following:  metal cofactor assembly, protein radicals, oxygen
              intermediates, signaling, metal metabolism, ribozymes, peptide processing, and
              long range electron transfer.
