Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to design and synthesize a new class of protein
              biomaterials for use in vascular graft applications.  The proteins consist of
              repeats of elastin derived polypeptides with various cell binding peptides. 
              They will be produced by expressing artificial genes in bacteria.  The
              molecular structure of the materials will be manipulated via peptide sequence
              modifications and crosslinking methods in order to optimize mechanical and cell
              interaction properties.  Finally, the attachment, spreading and function of
              vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells on these materials will be
              evaluated under both static and perfused culture conditions, as a function of
              molecular properties.
