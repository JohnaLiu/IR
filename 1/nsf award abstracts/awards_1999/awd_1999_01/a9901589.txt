              Associates in Experimental Computer Science:  Postdoctoral Research in
              Self-Reconfiguring Robots

The vision of this work is to create more
              versatile robots by using self-reconfiguration: hundreds of small modules
              autonomously organizing and reorganizing as geometric structures to best
fit
              the terrain on which the robot has to move, the shape the object the robot has
              to manipulate, or the sensing needs for a given task.  Large collections of
              mini robots, fabricated using rapidly evolving robotic technology will perform
              useful coordinated work, including small scale actuation and repair, transport
              of small artifacts, active manipulation of surface properties, etc.

To
              create flexible, robust, and autonomous robotic systems capable of such
              applications, a fundamental goal of this research is to develop a science-base
              for self-reconfiguring robotics.  This is a considerable challenge, which is
              being met through (1) new designs for reconfigurable
systems and (2) new ideas
              on algorithmic planning and control that can confer autonomous
              reconfigurability.  This kind of reconfigurable robotics science will greatly
              enhance the autonomous capabilities of distributed robotic systems.

More
              specifically, the central challenges for this work are to (1) design and build
              simple modules that can self-reconfigure in three dimensions; (2) build
              distributed robot systems using these modules; (3) develop and implement
              centralized as well as distributed planning algorithms and
control systems
              that allow a set of modules to self-reconfigure as any desired static or
              dynamic geometric structures; (4) analyze the dynamic stability and fault
              tolerance of self-reconfiguring structures during motion; and (5) demonstrate
              the applicability of this technology through experiments in versatile
              locomotion and manipulation, and self-repair.
