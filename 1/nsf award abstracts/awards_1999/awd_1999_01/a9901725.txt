Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innnovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              high-capacitance electrodes that combine high surface area with the electric
              double-layer effect and fast, reversible faradaic processes at the electrode. 
              This will be accomplished by infiltrating high surface area carbons with Ru02,
              via a unique process developed at Ultramet and successfully demonstrated in the
              Phase I project.  The net result will be an electrode combining the high
              surface area of the carbon substrate with the pseudocapacitance properties of
              Ru02.  The primary drawbacks of current electrochemical double-layer capacitor
              (EDLCs) devices are cost and power density.  The EDLC electrode material that
              allows for the greatest specific capacitance is ruthenium oxide (Ru02), which
              is derived from ruthenium, an expensive platinum group metal.  The cost of such
              capacitors is therefore quite high.  Furthermore, because electrode surface
              area is a key parameter for capacitance, and because current technology only
              allows dispersal of the oxide electrode material to surface areas of -120 m2/g,
              the bulk of the oxide mass remains unused.

The optimization of high surface
              area, high-capacitance electrodes will have many applications in both the
              civilian and military sectors.  Civilian applications include electric
              automobiles portable communications equipment, pulse power supplies for
              high-power lasers, burst power for high-power signal generation, and power
              conditioning for satellites.  Military applications include space power
              conditioning, laser weaponry, electronic fuzes, safety and arming devices, and
              missile guidance systems.
