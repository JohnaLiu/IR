Title:
              Interaction of Regional Climate Modes: A Global Hypermode?

The proposed work
              aims to test the idea that there are one or more global 'hypermodes' of climate
              variability composed of mutually interacting regional climate features or
              'modes'. A coherent physical framework that can explain the observed decadal
              variation in regional climate, is sought in terms of the interactions between
              climate changes in other parts of the globe. The challenge is to describe the
              statistical relationships that exist between well known regional climate
              features (the Monsoon, ENSO, North Pacific Oscillation) and physical processes
              that govern these interactions. The nonstationary character of the statistical
              relations or interdecadal modulation makes this difficult. A set of long global
              climate model simulations from three different models, with/without full ocean
              physics, will serve as the basic data source for the study.  The main thrust of
              this work is that for reliable climate prediction, regional climate changes
              need to be understood in a global context. The work is important because it
              will yield an enhanced understanding of the processes contributing to climate
              variability.
