This SGER award is aimed at rapid response placement of a
              volcanologist on site at one of the worst volcano-related disasters of the
              decade. Torrential rains associated with hurricane Harold filled the summit
              crater of Volcan Casita, Nicaragua apparently leading to rapid overflow through
              a breach in the crater wall. The resulting avalanche of water-saturated
              volcanic debris swept down the mountain enveloping several villages. Volcanic
              mudflows (lahars) such as this pose major hazards to populations throughout the
              world, yet details regarding the triggering mechanism(s), flow characteristics,
              and material properties generally only are available from pre-historic or
              ancient deposits. An approximate one-week field campaign, in collaboration with
              the Geophysical Institute of the University of Nicaragua, will focus on
              measurements and sampling of fresh lahar deposits, collection of eye-witness
              accounts of the initiation and flow, and aerial observations of the source area
              and outflow pattern. Samples and other data will be evaluated upon return from
              the field, and these data will be used to construct a model for the inception
              of the Volcan Casita mudflow. The primary data and observations, together with
              the derived model, will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms
              leading to lahar formation and emplacement, and will assist in assessing and
              mitigating the risks associated with these phenomena in other regions.
