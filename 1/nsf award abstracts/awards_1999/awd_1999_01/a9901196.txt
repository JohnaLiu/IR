Abstract    :
              This award supports a program to rescue geophysical data collected in West
              Antarctica (primarily seismic and radar data) over several decades by students
              and researchers from the Geophysical and Polar Research Center at the
              University of Wisconsin (UW).  The data will be retrieved from the UW archives
              and transferred (from the magnetic tapes which they are currently on) and
              recorded to a more modern format.  In addition, the metadata that is in field
              notebooks will be summarized and the entire collection will be submitted to the
              National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) where their long-term stability can
              be ensured.  Others will do some reprocessing of the data in order to allow
              easier access to the data.  Information about the methods of collection,
              formats, unwritten assumptions behind all the experiments, experiment designs,
              instrument settings and data formats will all be noted in the file.  The window
              of opportunity for retrieving and archiving these data is rapidly closing and
              this project will help to make these data available to others for future
              research projects.
