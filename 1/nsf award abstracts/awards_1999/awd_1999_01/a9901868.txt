Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project has technological
              developments that can extend the working lifetimes of oil and gas wells and
              improve total recovery of hydrocarbons. Aphron-Based Drill-In Fluids, a recent
              technical development, has created a new market for specialty biopolymers,
              
such as xanthan gum. The Aphron-Based Drill-in Fluids are designed with
              aphrons (microbubbles of gas less than 100 microns in size) that are stabilized
              by xanthan gums. This biopolymer has an unusual property of elevated,
              low-shear-rate viscosity (LSRV) along with several other desirable properties.
              Chitosan, a naturally occurring polysaccharide produced from crustacean shells,
              and some of its derivatives have LSRV properties. We propose to extend the
              knowledge and testing of chitosan products
in oil and gas drilling operations
              by field testing of chitosan products in aphron-based fluids. We propose to
              enhance the properties of chitosan through derivatization methods demonstrated
              in Phase I. We plan
to contract with the University of Maryland to perform
              physical and chemical characterization and to establish a basic
              structure-function understanding for chitosan and chitosan derivatives.
    
              Because of some unusual properties such as low-shear-rate viscosity, acid
              solubility, and cationic properties, chitosan and chitosan derivatives have
              potential commercial applications in drilling fluids
and drill-in fluids used
              to drill oil and gas wells. Although other potential commercial applications
              exist, The Venture Group will focus short-term on the commercialization of
              these products in the drilling fluid market. Long-term, other commercial
              applications of chitosan and its derivatives will be developed.
