Abstract    :
              Whitlock

A US-Brazil collaborative research proposal between Dr.
              Paula A. Whitlock, Brooklyn College and Research Foundation, CUNY and Professor
              Silvio A. Vitiello, University of Campinas, Brazil for a three-year study of
              shadow wavelength investigations of helium films adsorbed on a variety of
              surfaces by Quantum Monte Carlo methods. 

The US PI will benefit from
              complementary strengths of her Brazilian counterpart.  Professor Vitiello, for
              example, is a noted expert in the area of numerical studies of quantum
              many-body physical systems with a particular emphasis on superfluid Helium,
              while Dr. Whitlock is one of the pioneers in the simulation by exact methods of
              quantum fluids.  Further, this collaboration will strengthen US institutional
              ties with an CAPINAS, a Brazilian research institution noted for its quality
              investigations and analysis.

The principle goal of this research is to
              broaden scientific knowledge and will undoubtedly resolve many issues in
              microscopic theory.
