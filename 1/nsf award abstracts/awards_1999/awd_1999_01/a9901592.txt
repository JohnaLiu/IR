              Postdoctoral Research Associates in Experimental Computer Science:  Support for
              Developing Highly Available Distributed Applications

The focus of this
              research in highly available distributed algorithms and systems is on
              group
communications services and their applications.  Group communication
              technology is becoming commonly exploited in academia and industry, and the
              significance of the group communication paradigm is becoming widely
              acknowledged.  The goals of the work are to 1) construct a comprehensive
              framework for the construction of groupware and computer supported cooperative
              work applications, based on the group communication paradigm, 2) model complex
              distributed systems formally, focusing on group communication systems, and
              implement algorithms and communication protocols in a way that would allow
              verification of the actual implementation, and 3) understand more of the
              inherent limitations of fault tolerant distributed systems and the tradeoffs
              involved in building such systems.
