Abstract    :
              This project will continue the successful mission of the Laboratory for Advanced
              Manufacturing and Control (LAMC) funded through a previous NSF grant.  The
              project will focus on the reviewing of international research and development
              specifically in the areas of manufacturing sensing and control and assess its
              applicability to manufacturing machines, equipment and systems.  The
              investigator's experience will enable him to serve as a point of contact,
              especially for the younger members of the research community by helping them
              establish strong international networks.  The on-going work will entail four
              important aspects:  (1) to review the state of the art of this activity
              worldwide; (2) to make a critical assessment of it; (3) to prepare written
              yearly summaries of the findings; and (4) to assist young investigators, on an
              individual basis, desiring to establish international networks.  Papers will be
              presented at future National Science Foundation Design and Manufacturing
              Grantees Conferences as part of the traditional poster sessions held at these
              Conferences.  They could also be the keynote presentation at a workshop held in
              conjunction with the Conference.  The workshop will be of one-day duration and
              likely held the day prior to the beginning of the Conference.  Duplicate
              workshops could be scheduled at alternative events, i.e., at NAMRC or ASME
              activities.  The location(s) and related logistics would be worked out with the
              Conference host(s) and the relevant NSF Program Director.
