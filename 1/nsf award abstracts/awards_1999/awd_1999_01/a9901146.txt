Abstract    :
              Tankersley

      Many estuarine crustaceans have planktonic larvae that
              develop in coastal/shelf areas and then return to estuaries as postlarvae. 
              This study is designed to test the hypothesis that estuarine crustaceans use
              chemical and physical cues (1) for up-estuary transport, settlement, and
              metamorphosis of postlarvae (megalopae) and (2) for retention and juveniles
              (J1-J3 instars) in specific habitats.  Using the blue crab, Callinectes
              sapidus, as a representative species, stimulatory and inhibitory chemical cues
              will first be tested in a chemical choice tube to determine effective
              concentration ranges for behavioral responses that are potentially involved in
              habitat location.  Further laboratory experiments with a paddle wheel flume
              will study settlement site location behavior and settlement in the presence of
              realistic flow conditions, chemical cues and structure.  Finally, the effects
              of stimulatory and inhibitory cues on metamorphosis will be determined.  This
              information will permit a better understanding of the conditions necessary for
              successful completion of the postlarval and early juvenile phases of the life
              cycle of some estuarine crustaceans and the development of an integrative
              descriptive model of the behavioral responses to environmental stimuli during
              the transition from a planktonic phase (postlarval) to a mostly benthic
              existence as a juvenile in a nursery habitat.
