Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to research and
              develop a monolithic Ka-Band (26.0-40.0 GHz) Linear Phase Shifter.  The
              approach is to use a reflection of a pair of voltage control capacitors to
              obtain the phase shift.  A coplanar waveguide quadrature branch line coupler
              serves as the circuit while a pair of varactor diodes serves as the voltage
              control capacitors, Linearity in the phase shift is obtained by using a doping
              profile that provides a non-linear change in the DC capacitance that translates
              into a linear change in the phase shift at the frequency of interest.  Thus, 
              the project combines semiconductor material engineering with high frequency
              circuit design to obtain a linear phase shifter without the use of additional
              biasing circuits.  This results in a simple and monolithic device suitable for
              application in many areas of wireless communication.
     Commercial
              applications include MMW satellite communication (e.g. Ka-Band).  Others
              include vehicular radar systems, worldwide detection systems, personal
              communication systems such as LMDS and point to point radar for the
              telecommunication industry.
