Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to
              develop entirely new electrographic toners that, when combined with well-known
              electrographic printing techniques, can be used to inexpensively and reliably
              apply metallizations and dielectrics to multichip modules (MGM) with features
              as small as ten microns or less.  There is an unmet need today for a
              simplified, lower cost faster turnaround method for fabricating high density
              MCMs substrates.  The emergence of commercial compact-information products,
              such personal digital assistants, wireless communicators and distributed sensor
              systems are creating a revolution in the way commercial electronics are
              packaged.  These products share the attributes of being driven by small size,
              lightweight, high-operating frequencies and low cost.  The project entails
              creation of nanophase powders that are sinterable during the electrographic
              development and fixing cycles by means of novel adhesive fluxes and coatings. 
              When printed, the powders can be sintered together by heating to a modest
              temperature, forming a continuous metal film without having to overheat the MGM
              polymeric substrate.
     There is an unmet need for providing low-cost, fast
              turnaround high density multichip modules and high density printed circuits to
              microelectronics manufacturers.  Such a new technology could reduce MGM
              deposition capital equipment entry cost by an order of magnitude while at the
              same time increasing metallization production throughput by an order of
              magnitude.
