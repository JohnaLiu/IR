Abstract    :
              	This award is to fund travel by two researchers from Sookmyung Women's
              University in Seoul, South Korea to the Language Technologies Institute of
              Carnegie Mellon University.  The purpose of this visit is to continue bilateral
              discussions related to agent-based cross-language information retrieval.. The
              two groups have held preliminary discussions over the past year, and anticipate
              forming a collaborative research project. Korean language offers many important
              and unique research challenges to digital libraries research.  Solutions for
              information merging and retrieval from Korean/English corpora can be
              generalized to other non-character based languages, including Japanese and
              Chinese.
