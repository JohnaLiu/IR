Abstract    :
              This research program will utilize a kinetic particle code to analyze the
              processes involved with plasma transport at the Earth's magnetopause.  Full
              particle simulations will be used to study the fundamental processes involved
              in collisionless reconnection.  Hybrid particle/fluid simulations will then be
              performed to determine the large scale consequences of magnetopause
              reconnection.  Of particular interest in these simulations is the fact that
              they will use multiple ion species, which can lead to the excitation of
              Kelvin-Helmholz waves and bursty reconnection.  Bursty reconnection results in
              the formation of Flux Transfer Events, which have been observed many times in
              satellite data, but have yet to be satisfactorily explained.
