Many studies have suggested that habitat selection in
              tropical rainforest is more pronounced than in temperate areas. The
              availability of resources can affect an animal's choice of habitat and its
              distribution and there are numerous model of habitat selection that predict how
              individuals are distributed and how they disperse or move through patches of
              various qualities. Small mammals are idea for studying and test this idea. This
              study will use the tropical rain forests at the Cochu Cashu biological station
              in Peru, to test two alternative models of habitat selection, ideal free and
              ideal despotic distribution, and their associated dispersal patterns for small
              mammals that inhabit resource rich treefall gaps and the potentially less
              suitable understory. A two-year trapping program coupled with radio telemetry
              will be used to assess fitness components within and movement between these two
              habitats in three species of small mammals. Food supplementation experiments
              will determine whether food is a major factor for habitat selection. Results of
              this study will be of interest to evolutionary ecologists, and may have
              implications for conservation and management of small mammals in forest
              reserves.
