Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a
              continuation of the successful Phase I project. During this program,  a
              software-hardware system was developed based on high end micro-processors
              working in parallel and running a fully parallel state-of-the-art quantum
              chemistry program.  The  QuantumStation offers supercomputer performance at a
              fraction of the cost.  During Phase II,   a larger machine will be built, with
              32 processors, capable of solving Grand-Challenge type problems; improving  the
              parallel and serial performance of the  code and  enhancing program
              capability.
     The personal computer based software/hardware system will be
              of interest to chemical and pharmaceutical companies involved in drug and
              material design, as well as, University research departments and modeling
              groups.  It is affordable even by individual researchers and bench
              chemists.
