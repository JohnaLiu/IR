Title:
              Travel Support for U.S. Participation in the XV Congress of the International
              Union for Quaternary Research; Durban, South Africa; August 3-11,
              1999

Serious national concern about global climate change and the increasing
              numbers of natural environmental hazards emphasize the need for continuing
              research on present and past geological environments.  International
              collaboration continues to be of paramount importance for the analyses of
              scientific problems of the recent geological past relevant to our current and
              future environment.  This award supports U.S. participation in the XV Congress
              of the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) in Durban, South
              Africa, August 3-11, 1999.  Because of its interdisciplinary tradition, INQUA
              has direct relevance to a broad range of global change problems.  This
              conference will focus on the environmental background to hominid evolution, as
              well as combining paleoenvironmental observations and modeling.
