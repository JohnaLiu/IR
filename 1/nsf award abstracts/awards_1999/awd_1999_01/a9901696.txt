This  proposal  addresses
               the  broad  area  of  operating system support for quality-of-service(QOS) 
              resource  management.  It specifically   targets   systems   that   exploit 
              this  resource management  strategy  to  achieve  adaptive  behavior  in 
              mobile computing.   Building   on  techniques  for  adaptation  recently
              identified by the research  community,  the  proposed  work  will develop the
              critical understanding and the experimental tools and techniques needed to
              compare the merits of alternative approaches to  adaptation.    It is likely
              that the insights offered by such evaluation will lead to the development  of 
              new  techniques  for adaptation.    Further, the resource that has dominated
              attention so far in  the  research  community  is  network  bandwidth.  The
              proposed  work  will  broaden  the scope of adaptation to include battery 
              power.    Overall,  this  work  will  help   develop   a well-validated  and 
              well-accepted  set  of design principles for mobile computing systems.
