The main objective of the Gordon research conference on Nuclear
              chemistry is to provide the international community of nuclear scientists with
              a unique forum on which the newest developments at the forefront of this
              science can be presented and subjected to detailed and extended discussions and
              criticism.  The purpose of the conference is to encourage communication and the
              discussions to be conducted in an atmosphere conducive to open interactions
              between the scientists, provoking new and even speculative ideas for future
              research.

To accomplish these goals requires the participation in all of the
              conference activities of a significant number of leaders in the field. 
              However, a science as rapidly developing as nuclear chemistry invites and needs
              cooperative efforts on all levels with a range of expertise for its growth. 
              Therefore, younger scientists from all countries are encouraged to participate
              in the conference and to present their ideas.  In particular, in anticipation
              of the future need of manpower and of a growing importance of international
              cooperative scientific ventures, it appears necessary to expose selected
              advanced graduate student from the major international research universities to
              the new opportunities and techniques in nuclear science.
