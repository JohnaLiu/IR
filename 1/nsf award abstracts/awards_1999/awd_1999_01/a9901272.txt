Abstract    :
              The proposed conference on 'Social Change and Sustainable Transport (SCAST)'
              brings together European and North American scholars from social science and
              transportation engineering traditions to share current research and to identify
              avenues of investigation that will benefit from transatlantic collaboration. 
              Specifically, the focus will be on differences and similarities in the social
              structures of both continents and how these might provide a rational foundation
              for future research on sustainable transport systems.  The effort was spawned
              from the recognition that future generations will not enjoy current levels of
              mobility in the absence of some very drastic changes in the manner by which the
              transport needs of society are met.  

The goals of the conference are to
              exchange cutting-edge research ideas and methods, to stimulate international
              collaborations and strengthen existing linkages on this theme, and to enhance
              the level of involvement of junior scholars from diverse academic backgrounds. 
              The funding request is to defray the expenses of North American participants
              only-European participation is being funded by the European Science Foundation.
