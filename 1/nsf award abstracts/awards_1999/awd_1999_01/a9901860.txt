Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              demonstrate production of reticulated foam filters (RFF) by chemical vapor
              deposition (CVD).  These are designed forthe next generation of filters for
              molten aluminum.  Phase I demonstrated the efficacy of this CVDRFF technology
              for molten metal filtration, with filters being successfully fabricated and
              tested in both molten aluminum and molten killed steels. CVDRFFs demonstrate
              excellent performance in molten aluminum, with 90% open porosity to the liquid
              metal, 100% capture efficiency of solid particles greater than 5 microns, and
              outstanding corrosion resistance.  Phase II will construct and test a pilot
              production reactor for the manufacture of commercial-scale CVDRFFs.  Millions
              of pounds of molten aluminum will be cast through the filters, with their
              particle capture efficiency, permeability, throughput, and corrosion resistance
              measured by state-of-the-art equipment.  As a result, a new generation of
              filters with finer pore size, greater capture efficiency, and longer life will
              be developed and optimized for the filtration of molten aluminum.
     The
              performance of current high-efficiency filters for molten metals is constrained
              by limitations in particle capture efficiency, porosity, and/or corrosion
              resistance.  High-strength, high-permeability, high void fraction,
              corrosion-resistant filters by the CVDRFF technology are expected to have
              direct application in the $74 million/year molten aluminum filtration market,
              which includes can and compact disc foil stock, as well as advanced
              aluminum-lithium alloys such as those used in the space shuttle external fuel
              tank and other aerospace applications.
