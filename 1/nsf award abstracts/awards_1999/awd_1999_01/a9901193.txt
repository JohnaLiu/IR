Abstract    :
              The research project is on power modeling, analysis and minimization for
              battery-powered digital CMOS circuits. An integrated battery-hardware model of
              the battery-operated circuits is being developed. It accounts for architectural
              and gate-level features of the circuit, statistical properties of the
              instructions and data that are applied to the circuit, and electro-chemical and
              output characteristics of the battery cell that powers the circuit. Using this
              unified model, the project is addressing the problem of finding appropriate
              metrics and effective design practices to maximize the battery service life
              under a performance constraint. Algorithms and techniques are being developed
              for: (1) static and dynamic voltage scaling, selection of battery cells to
              match a given circuit, (2) RT-level design of low power VLSI circuits to match
              a given battery cell, (3) use of multiple battery cell types within a battery
              pack to maximize the battery service life for given form factor and weight, and
              (4) dynamic power management. Powerful mathematical models and algorithms for
              power estimation and management in complex battery-powered digital CMOS designs
              are being explored.
