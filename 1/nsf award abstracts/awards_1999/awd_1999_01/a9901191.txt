Abstract    :
              This project is developing a new dynamic supply current-based alternative
to
              Iddq test for the next generation of ICs. The methods being investigated
are
              primarily based on a recently developed test metric, the energy
consumption
              ratio (ECR). Research on the project is being conducted on
three tracks:
              algorithmic-test, manufacture-test and self-test. The
algorithmic track
              develops test generation and fault simulation algorithms
for ECR test that
              target the detection of specific modeled faults. The
focus is on faults that
              are hard to detect with or escape traditional
methods. The manufacture test
              track focuses on the development of
fault-independent test methods for ICs.
              The objective is to develop methods
to use ECR-based test similar to those
              used in practice for Idd test. The
focus is on characterizing the defect
              coverage achievable with ECR test and
identifying test conditions which
              optimize defect coverage. The aim of the
self-test track is to develop a
              built-in self-test architecture for ECR
test. A robust dynamic current sensor
              is being designed and evaluated..
