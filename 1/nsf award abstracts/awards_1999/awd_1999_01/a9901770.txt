Abstract    :
                   This  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to
              develop and commercialize a unique class of  laser and nonlinear optical
              crystals for application in telecommunications, materials processing, optical
              computing, medicine, and food safety.  The goals of the Phase I Program were
              met, and as a result, a promising class of materials with many potential
              commercial applications was developed.  In Phase I the feasibility of the
              approach was demonstrated by identifying crystal-growth procedures for several
              derivatives, evaluating their crystal structures, and studying their optical
              properties.  Finally, we modeled their optical properties and predicted
              performance as both laser-host and NLO materials.  As a result, we have
              identified the following candidate materials for further development in a Phase
              II program.  The objective of the Phase II program is to apply the knowledge
              gained in Phase I to further develop crystal growth procedures to produce
              crystals of quality for incorporation into prototype devices, in preparation
              for Phase III commercializertion.  We believe that a new class of optical
              products will be developed with significant commercial potential.
	Successful
              completion of the Phase II Program will lead to the development and
              commercialization of a unique class of laser and nonlinear optical crystals for
              application in telecommunications, materials processing, optical computing,
              medicine, and food safety.
