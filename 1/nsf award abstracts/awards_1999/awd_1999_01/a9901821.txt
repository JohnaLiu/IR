Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses
              the development of a wide-bandwidth Superconducting Quantum Interface Device
              (SQUID)-based amplifier for cryogenic particle detectors.  An approach for
              implementing a two-stage SQUID amplifier readout scheme was first introduced by
              the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  Utilizing this
              approach, the firm has already optimized and successfully commercialized a
              first-generation SQUID amplifier system with associated room temperature
              electronics.  This system exhibits a sensitivity of 2 pA/root Hz, a bandwidth
              of 2 MHz, and an operating temperature of 0.7K - 4.2K.  However, the relatively
              small bandwidth and the lower bound of its operating temperature have limited
              its applicability to a small fraction of all cryogenic detectors.  During the
              Phase I project, the feasibility of an innovative design scheme integrating
              100-200 SQUID capable of 50 MHz bandwidth while retaining low noise performance
              was established.  It is, therefore, proposed to demonstrate and prepare for
              Phase III commercialization effort an amplifier system based on this SQUID
              architecture which possesses 1 pA/root Hz sensitivity and 50 MHz bandwidth.  As
              part of the development effort, the fabrication materials will be altered to
              allow operation well below 0.7 K down to a few mK. This system significantly
              expands the applicability of the amplifier to virtually all cryogenic x-ray and
              particle detector readouts. 
     The availability of such a low-cost SQUID
              amplifier would result in their use for nearly all high energy physics research
              experiments, high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy, imaging detectors, particle
              identification systems, biomagnetometry for the mapping of brain functions, and
              detection of corrosion and cracks-in aircraft.
