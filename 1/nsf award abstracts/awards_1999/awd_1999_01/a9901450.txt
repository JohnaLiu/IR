Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is based on
              the concept of a multimodal approach to the teaching of mathematics to the
              blind.  Speech Assisted Learning (SAL), a stand-alone technocentric system that
              provides education through a combination of Braille and synthetic speech,
              ameliorates the critical shortage of Braille instructors by providing
              technology with which blind students may augment teacher instruction or teach
              themselves new codes of Braille and mathematical concepts.  SAL is user
              friendly.  There is no keyboard and no commands to memorize.  Building on the
              protoype designed, produced, and assessed in Phase I, the goal of the Phase II
              project is to integrate research and education by refining hardware, software
              and curricula in order to develop the intellectual capacity of blind children
              and adults.  The advantages, disadvantages and effects on learning that result
              from the extended use of Speech Assisted Braille Math will be investigated.
  
                Speech Assisted Braille Math proffers an innovative Braille math instruction
              system for schools, libraries, homes, government agencies, and community
              centers.   A new partnership will be formed to produce and carefully integrate
              Braille curriculum, hardware, and software, thus interconnecting  Exceptional
              Teaching Aids, Inc., with its background in education to Blazie Engineering,
              Inc. with its proven expertise in hardware development and to Duxbury Systems,
              Inc. a leader in the field of Braille translation.
