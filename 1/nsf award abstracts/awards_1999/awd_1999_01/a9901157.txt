The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide support for a four-month
              postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Erik B. Melchiorre of the College of the
              Menominee Nation to work with Dr. Peter A. Williams at the University of
              Western Sydney Nepean in New South Wales, Australia.
This research will
              involve basic isotope studies of transition metal carbonates to define aspects
              of their formation.  Dr. Melchiorre will assemble and analyze malachite,
              azurite and other transition metal carbonate samples.  Experimentally
              determined fractionation factors will be used to interpret the conditions of
              formation of natural samples.
The Australian National Museum is within a short
              drive from the site, providing access to an extensive collection of divalent
              cation carbonates, including many historical samples from mines that are
              presently inaccessible.  Added to this is the opportunity to do field work on
              naturally occurring divalent cation carbonates, which are a result of
              Australia's deep weathering.
