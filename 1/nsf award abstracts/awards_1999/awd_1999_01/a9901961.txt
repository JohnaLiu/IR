The New Jersey Academy of Natural Sciences, The Franklin
              Institute Science Museum, the New Jersey State Aquarium, and the Philadelphia
              Zoo request $957,158.  The consortium of Philadelphia area science museums
              jointly with community-based organizations will design and implement a science
              experience that will stimulate, encourage, and enrich families' interest,
              learning, and involvement in science. 
	
The collaborative known as Families
              Exploring Science Together (FEST) will offer multi-level programming ranging
              from introductory museum experiences to in-depth science inquiry activities for
              families that are associated with community-based organizations that serve
              African-American, Latino, and Asian communities. The target audience will be
              families from 8-12 culturally diverse neighborhoods in the Philadelphia-Camden
              region.
