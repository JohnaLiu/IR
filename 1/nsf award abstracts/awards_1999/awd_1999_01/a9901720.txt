Abstract    :
                   The  Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on
              establishing a fundamental understanding of the operation of an ozone-advanced
              oxidation reactor, which utilizes low-frequency sonics as a means to reduce
              ozone consumption, increase its solubility and improve mass transport. The
              process appears to "catalyze" ozone-oxidation reactions. The Phase II program
              includes the development, design and demonstration of a prototype, pilot-scale
              processor as an efficient and cost-effective method for advanced oxidation
              applications.
     Use of the advanced oxidation reactor represents a quantum
              improvement in process productivity and renders expanded applications for the
              replacement of harmful oxidation and bleaching reagents with ozone for a broad
              range of industrial applications. These include oxidation of biochemical oxygen
              demand and chemical oxygen demand in paper pulp, textile, and land fill
              leachate wastewaters; bleaching of pulps; and disinfection in food
              processing.
