Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              complete the research and initiate the implementation of a software system that
              can efficiently create 3D polygonal mesh surface models of anatomical
              structures from 2D section data such as CT, MRI, ultrasound and cryosections.
              The software system will be integrated onto single platform with a
              semi-automated segmentation module, a 3D model-based registration module, an
              automatic connectivity triangulation module and a post-processing system. The
              integration of these modules will provide a new and innovative way to capture
              and deliver expert knowledge for assisting in the creation of highly accurate
              3D surface anatomical models. 
     3D polygonal mesh models of anatomical
              structures are used by diverse groups such as researchers, educators, medical
              professionals, diagnosticians, multimedia publishers, simulation design
              specialists, and entertainment and gaming industry engineers. This software
              would allow these diverse groups to efficiently create their own models at a
              more reasonable price and at a much faster rate than is currently possible
