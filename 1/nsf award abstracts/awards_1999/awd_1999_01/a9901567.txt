Abstract    :
              9901567 
Martin

               Big Ideas Entertainment, Inc. is producing a
              coherent test sequence, 30-seconds to 1-minute in length,  that combines
              character animation with live action footage.  The purpose is to assess the
              different methods of animation and compositing to produce an appropriate
              "marriage" between animation and live action footage, including testing the
              SANDDE hand-drawn animation system vs. traditional cel animation.  The
              exploratory research also will test CGI processing (digital compositing) vs.
              optical printing. 

	The footage to be produced, though short, will be
              developed with science content, a treatment, shooting script, and storyboard. 
              Live action footage will be selected, animation characters designed, and one
              minute of animation and live action footage will be produced.  The resulting
              footage will be evaluated by screening and focus group interviews with an
              audience of children and adults, as well as being assessed by professionals in
              the large-format film field.
