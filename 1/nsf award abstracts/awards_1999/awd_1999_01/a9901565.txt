Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), for
              the support of a two year supplemental international collaborative project
              involving the Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled,
              "Combined Research-Curriculum Development on Maintenance and Reliability
              Engineering," under the direction of Dr. Thomas Kerlin.  The project involves
              expansion of the curriculum development activities currently underway in the
              CRCD project in the area of maintenance and reliability engineering through
              collaboration with three French institutions involved in similar activities. 
              The course development activities will provide two new courses to augment the
              four courses being developed under the current CRCD award.  This will be
              accomplished in a cost effective manner by sharing course resources with the
              French.  The four courses being developed under the CRCD award will be
              transferred to the French and two courses from France will be transferred to
              the University of Tennessee to augment its ongoing curriculum development
              activity.
