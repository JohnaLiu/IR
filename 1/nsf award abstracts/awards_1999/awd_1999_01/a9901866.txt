Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project  implements
              flexible hardware and software devices of a class of combined modulation and
              coding techniques called Turbo Product Coded Modulation (TPCM) that
              significantly outperforms the current techniques in digital communications
              systems, with regard to achieving high bits per Hz modulation at a low signal
              to noise ratio.  Efficient Channel Coding (ECC) will also investigate
              enhancements to the TPCM decoding algorithms as well as applications in other
              modulated channels.  The hardware devices will be based on an existing
              application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) product that contains the
              decoding engine for TPCM, and the software devices will be based on existing
              digital signal processor (DSP) devices.  The result of the research will be
              practical TPCM prototype products that provide enhancement performance over
              existing techniques.  For example, one TPCM scheme as applied to 32-ary
              Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) offers performance within 0.65 dB of the
              theoretical limit for this modulation scheme.
     Flexible TPCM systems are
              useful in a wide range of digital communications system in which power and
              bandwidth are limited resources.  These include ECC is targeting TPCM insertion
              into the next generation satellite communications modems, Direct Broadcast
              Satellite, and other future satellite communications systems as well as
              emerging terrestrial systems.  These terrestrial systems include Wireless Local
              Area Networks, Digital Radio, Digital Television, Local Multipoint Distribution
              Systems, IMT-2000, and Digital Subscriber Links.
