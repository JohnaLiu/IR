Abstract    :
              This research focuses on developing modeling, analysis and vector
generation
              techniques for some of the emerging deep submicron defects.
Specifically, this
              project is developing techniques to model the excessive
power supply noise,
              the interconnect crosstalk faults and the resistive
short and open faults as
              statistical delay faults. The results of the
modeling process are being used
              to select target delay faults for test
evaluation and test generation. This
              project further investigates vector
generation techniques for the selected
              target delay faults. The tests not
only activate and propagate the faults but
              also cause various worst-case
noises such that the propagation delay along the
              sensitized path is
maximized. Furthermore, DFT requirements and rules for
              eliminating or
reducing the probability of having certain noise faults and for
              simplifying
vector generation for these faults are being explored.
