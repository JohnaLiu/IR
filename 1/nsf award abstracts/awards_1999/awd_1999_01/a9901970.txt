Abstract    :
              Isoetes is a genus of fern allies known as quillworts found throughout much of
              the world except in arid regions.  Not surprisingly, quillworts are rare in the
              Middle east, and represented only by three species.  Outside of the Bursa
              region of Turkey, the endemic Middle east Quillwort (Isoetes olympica) is found
              only in a single pool in the Jebel Druze in Syria.  The Jebel Druz is a series
              of ancient volcanoes in southern Syria near Jordon border, and has the highest
              rate of endemism in Syria and surrounding regions.  It is becoming increasingly
              impacted by habitat destruction and human intrusion.  The taxonmic status of
              Isoetes olympica in Syria is unclear and may represent an isolated population
              long diverged from sister species.  This project is designed to survey the
              distrubtion and abundance of existing Syrian populations of Isoetes olympica,
              make cytogenetic, ultrastructural, and molecular studies of the morphological
              and genetic characteristics, and to curate tissue and herbarium specimens of
              this threatened species.  This project is funded through the Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research program which provides small-scale support for high-risk,
              time-sensitive research.
