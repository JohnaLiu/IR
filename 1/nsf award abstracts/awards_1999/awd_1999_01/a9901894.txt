Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to improve robustness, efficiency and quality of
              nonlinear, curved geometry and higher-order elements by developing:

tight
              bounds for nonlinear geometry in terms of control structures -- crucial for
              stable and fast rendering, robust intersection testing, coarse approximation,
              hierarchical approximation; 

localized-hierarchy and moment-preserving
              modeling in a NURBS-compatible framework -- needed for interactive exploratory
              design and animation; 

new tools, functionals and an experimental setup for
              improving surface quality. 

Software dissemination will concentrate on small
              packages, acknowledging the fact that many open systems with plug-in capability
              exist. The research activity will be complemented by structuring and developing
              the graphics and computer geometry curriculum at the University of Florida both
              at the bachelors and the PhD-level.
