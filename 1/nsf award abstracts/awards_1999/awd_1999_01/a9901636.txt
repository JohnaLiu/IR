Nearest Neighbor Algorithms for
              Similarity Retrieval in Multimedia
Databases and Medical
              Applications

Similarity search is a very important operation in multimedia
              databases and other database applications involving complex objects.  The
              similarity between two objects is represented with a distance metric.  Two
              existing approaches for handling similarity search are addressed.  The first is
              based on mapping to low-dimensional geometric space (making use of data
              structures such as the R-tree), while the second directly indexes the objects
              based on distances (making use of data structures such as the M-tree).  For
              both approaches, the development of new incremental algorithms for nearest
              neighbor search are being investigated.  The algorithms will have the property
              of reporting their result one-by-one in order of
similarity, with as little
              effort as possible expended to produce each new result object.  The incremental
              aspect provides significant benefits in situations when the number of desired
              neighbors is unknown in advance.  The application of the algorithms to problems
              in fields such as multimedia databases, medical application, as well as others,
              are being investigated.
