Reading Rainbow is a long running, highly acclaimed
              children's television series designed to engage children in reading.  Over the
              years, the series has incorporated both a science strand and a mathematics
              strand.  Nebraskans for Public Television is now producing two additional
              math-focused programs and one integrated math/science program.  These programs
              will further integrate math-oriented books into the series, will heighten the
              visibility of quality children's math-oriented books, and will model how
              children can understand and enjoy mathematics and science in the world around
              them.

Outreach will be coordinated with libraries and museums nationwide. 
              The project also will expand the "Math for Families Workshops," which were
              previously developed, from 50 public broadcasting stations to 100 stations. 
              The workshops also will be integrated into the PBS "Ready To Learn" endeavor.
