The goal of the research is to determine whether or not amino
              acids and carbohydrates are released during photochemical decomposition of
              humic substances.  If these compounds are observed, their rates of production
              will be quantified; then their importance in comparison to previously measured
              photoproducts can be determined.  A mass balance including all observed
              carbon-based photoproducts would be determined.  Then it can be determined
              whether all of the low-molecular weight carbon produced by the photolysis of
              humic substances is accounted for by the observed individual photoproducts. 
              Long-term studies will allow a better understanding of the importance of these
              reactions in the global carbon cycle.
