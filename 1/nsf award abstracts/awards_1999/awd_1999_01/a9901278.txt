This Americas Program award will fund a three year cooperative
              research project between Dr. Malcolm Low, Vollum Institute, Oregon Health
              Sciences University, Portland, Oregon, and Dr. Marcello Rubinstein, Universidad
              de Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They plan to utilize a new technology that will
              produce a conditional knockout of dopamine receptor subtypes in selective brain
              substrates of the adult mouse.  The objective of these mutations in mammalian
              brain is to provide the experimental control of physiological processes.  The
              generation of null alleles by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells
              is a powerful technique to determine the physiological function of genes in
              vivo.  However, drawbacks of this approach include the loss of multiple
              functions of a single gene and developmental compensation by changes in the
              expression of other genes processes in specific neurons. In this project the
              investigators will develop a new technology to overcome these limitations.  If
              successful in the dopaminergic system, the same experimental strategy would be
              generally applicable to the functional analysis of many genes expressed in the
              brain.

The two investigators are experts in the techniques to be employed,
              therefore significant new mutational approaches, mouse strains and insights
              into dopamine receptor function will result from this work.  The broader impact
              of this research includes, besides the development of new methods to produce
              localized, conditional mutations in central nervous systems genes, the
              understanding the functional significance of the five different dopamine
              receptor subtypes in localized brain regions
