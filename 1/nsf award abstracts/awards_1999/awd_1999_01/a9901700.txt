Authorization must be a cornerstone of
              effective security in
distributed computing.  Moreover, in large-scale systems
              authorization
must itself be scalable.  This project will conduct a
              holistic
investigation by looking concurrently and synergistically
              at
architecture, mechanisms, and models for scalable authorization.
These
              three aspects are intertwined and mutually dependent, so
decisions made in one
              impact the choices in others.  Yet they can be
profitably separated for
              scientific study.  The project will develop
and refine a set of architectures
              for enforcement and administration,
and analyze their relative advantages and
              disadvantages.  It will
develop a systematic analysis of techniques for
              binding identity and
authorization information, and the pros and cons of
              mechanisms based
on different binding means.  The third prong of the project
              will
develop decentralized models for management of authorizations. 
              This
project will undertake theoretical and conceptual basic
              research
augmented by selected proof-of-concept experiments to validate
              the
theory.
