The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Susan G. Singley with support
              for twelve months to work with Dr. Ian Pool at the Population Studies Centre of
              the University of Waikato, in Hamilton, New Zealand.  Their research is on
              "Restructuring the "Family Wage": Economic and Family Change in New Zealand,
              1976-1996."
This project will examine the joint impact of family and economic
              change on poverty, inequality, and gender roles in New Zealand, which has
              undergone dramatic economic and social policy restructuring during the 1980s
              and 1990s.  "Family wage" is the earnings, which are sufficient for a
              breadwinner to support a family.  Dr. Singley will do a quantitative analysis
              of changes in the family wage between 1976 and 1996, using census data.  Then
              she will do a qualitative inquiry into economic and social policy changes
              during this time period that will complement the quantitative analysis.
The
              Population Studies Centre houses a computer-based data set of the 1976-1996
              censuses and they have research funds available to support additional census
              data extraction.  Current work at the Centre has focused on issues of family
              structural change, economic well-being, and the interface of demographic
              analysis and policy development.  This project will allow a mutual exchange of
              ideas on methodological issues and techniques relevant to social problems
              facing both countries.
