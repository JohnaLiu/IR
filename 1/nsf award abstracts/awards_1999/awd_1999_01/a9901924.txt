Abstract    :
              This doctoral dissertation research project focuses on the adaptive strategies
              developed by ordinary Russian citizens in response to a drastically changing
              societal environment. Unlike earlier studies, it views adaptation not as a
              fixed phenomenon but as an ongoing process. As such it requires longitudinal
              investigation throughout the different stages of the societal transformation
              involved. Such a dynamic perspective concentrates on the reciprocal
              relationship between the social actors and their environment and brings
              together diverse research findings on values, economic adaptations and social
              change in the Russian socio-political context. Data for this study will be
              obtained from a combination of participant observation, analysis of media and
              secondary sources (surveys, social studies, etc. relevant to the subject) and a
              longitudinal set of in-depth interviews. The first wave of interviews has been
              conducted in a pilot study conducted in Moscow by the student-investigator
              during the summer of 1998, prior to the August economic crisis. While the pilot
              study did not have a goal of statistically representing any particular social
              strata, the data obtained from the interviews appear to be a valuable basis for
              building a bank of rich information about the dynamic of the actors attitudes.
              values, beliefs, and behavior patterns in various stages of the macrosocietal
              change that has unfolded in Russia since the summer of 1998.
