Wavelength Routing in Support of Flexible and High Speed
              Internet

The aim of this research is to provide an experimental study of an
              innovative solution for high speed access and backbone networks in support of
              IP data transmission directly over Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), thus
              avoiding intermediate protocol layers, such as ATM and SONET.  The proposed
              solution enables optical transmission of both individual IP packets and large
              quantities of traffic comprising multiple IP packets using a novel control
              technique that allows on-demand establishment of optical circuits -- the
              so-called lightpaths or wavelength routes.

The postdoctoral research
              associate is being specifically trained to develop comprehensive knowledge of
              the current network infrastructure and identify the current drawbacks and
              bottlenecks that prevent the realization of a flexible telecommunications
              network capable of providing on-demand bandwidth to the user.  The research
              plan includes an evaluation of the impacts of the proposed solution on the
              current network, specifically addressing how the drawbacks and bottlenecks of
              the extant network are circumvented.  A considerable effort is devoted to
              investigate potential ways to make the proposed solution compatible with and
              transparent to the end user's equipment.
