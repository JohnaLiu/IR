Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project  will
              demonstrate a novel, high resolution laser microscope whose resolution can be
              better than a fifth of the wavelength of the laser utilized.  The laser
              microscope can be operated from the near infrared to near ultraviolet. 
              Operating at 400nm, this microscope will provide 80nm resolution or l/5 with
              working distance of several millimeters and depth of focus of many wavelengths.
              The project includes designing a prototype suitable for commercial deployment. 
              The dual objectives of the program are to demonstrate the technology on an
              optical table in the laboratory as well as to design the core optics for
              required wide spread commercialization.
   The research will include:  (1)
              complete characterization of the instrument at different wavelengths, (2)
              experiments on commercially important substrates like silicon and biological
              specimen, and (3) development of a compact prototype "objective" to improve
              performance.  Biological specimens as well as masks from the semiconductor
              industry will be used in the experiments in Phase II to establish the
              technique.  Science Research Laboratory will continue to work with the industry
              during Phase II so as to leverage NSF's investment and rapidly move the
              proposed technology into Phase III.
