Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II proposal addresses
              fabrication of polycrystalline, t'-phase zirconia for advanced applications. 
              Regular tetragonal (t-phase) zirconia (TZP) exhibits excellent properties at
              room temperature but degrades at ~150 to 300'C due to aging and undergoes creep
              at I IOO'C.  Thermal treatment Zt 2000'C results in t'-phase with excellent low
              temperature stability and excellent creep resistance up to 1500'C.  Phase II
              effort addresses material development for low and high temperature
              applications.  Materials with fine surface grains for high strength and coarse
              interior grains for excellent creep resistance will be fabricated and
              characterized.  One application will be high temperature (> 2000'C) heating
              elements for which there is no U. S. manufacturer.  Preliminary work on
              t'-phase heating elements in Phase I exhibited properties and performance
              superior to commercially available elements.  For example, t'-phase heating
              elements fabricated in Phase I could be heated from 1600 to 2100'C in 5 20
              minutes.  This shows t'-phase developed by Materials and Systems Research, Inc.
              (MSRI) exhibits excellent thermal shock resistance, a critical parameter for
              heating elements
     The potential commercial applications of polycrystalline
              t'-phase zitconia ceramics include:  (1) Heating elements for furnaces, (2)
              Refractories, (3) Kiln furniture, (4) Liners for chemical reactors requiring
              resistance to attack by water, acids, alkalis, (5) Storage heaters, (6)
              Substrates for superconductors, and (7) structural components requiring high
              creep resistance.
