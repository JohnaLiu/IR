	Research in Undergraduate Institutions:  Neutrino Oscillation
              Search" This proposal requests support for researchers at James Madison
              University for participation in the MINOS experiment at Fermilab (FNAL E875). 
              The MINOS experiment is a long baseline, high statistics search for neutrino
              oscillations with a special concentration on a neutrino mass difference
              suggested by recent significant results from the super-Kamiokande atmospheric
              neutrino detector.  Beginning in 2002, a beam of neutrinos produced by the new
              Fermilab Main Injector will be aimed toward the Soudan mine in northern
              Minnesota, where the 5.4 kiloton MINOS far-detector will be located.  The beam
              will be characterized by the MINOS near-detector located on the Fermilab site
              in Illinois.
