Abstract    :
              	Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be aimed at furthering
              our understanding of the basic forces and laws of nature.  It will include work
              on the "standard model" of particle interactions, which describes the strong,
              weak and electromagnetic interactions, and on string theory, which is currently
              the most successful attempt to include the force of gravity with the other
              forces in a unified framework.
	While the standard model has been very
              successful it leaves important questions unanswered.  The details of quark
              confinement within nucleons by the strong interactions are not understood. 
              Work planned for this project should lead to an improved understanding of the
              strong force and quark confinement.  The masses of fundamental particles in the
              standard model are also not understood and will be an active direction of
              inquiry through ideas related to the heavy top quark and string
              theory.
	String theory as a unified theory of all forces has many facets which
              will be explored in this project.  These include applications to black hole
              physics, to the structure of quantum gravity, to the structure of generalized
              electric-magnetic dualities, and also to various areas of mathematics related
              to geometry.
