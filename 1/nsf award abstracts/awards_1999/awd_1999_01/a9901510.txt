Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will investigate
              new instrumentation and applications of infrared ellipsometry.  Phase I
              demonstrated that a viable instrument having significantly superior spectral
              range, accuracy, and flexibility in application can be built.  Secondly, it
              demonstrated important new applications.  However, much remains to be
              accomplished.  Phase II objectives include development of brighter sources,
              better detectors, spectral range extension, advanced optical elements including
              polarizers and retarders, in situ applications, and numerous software issues
              including anisotropy, dynamic data acquisition, and partial depolarization,
              Materials research objectives include investigating new physics in polymeric
              nanometer-scale films, microstructures in III-V's and III-V Nitrides, as well
              as demonstrating low-temperature (> 4K) IR ellipsomctry capabilities.  The J.A.
              Woollam Co., Inc. has a strong record of commercialization, and is deeply
              committed to commercialization of the instrumentation and applications
              developed during this contract,
     Industries presently using visible
              ellipsometers and FTIR spectrometers are potential users of infrared
              ellipsometry.  For example: basic and applied research in industry,
              Universities, and microelectronics.  Uses include analysis of doping profiles
              in semiconductors, accurate optical constants, interface roughness, and
              nanometer-scale science: microstructure and chemical identification in complex
              ultra-thin films.
