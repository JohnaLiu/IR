The Education Development Center, Incorporated, requests
              $2,081,018 to create informal learning opportunities in science, mathematics,
              engineering and technology utilizing the study of the ancient African
              civilization of Nubia as context.  Educational activities and resources will be
              developed based on the extensive ongoing archeological research on historical
              Nubia.  The two main components of the project are a traveling exhibit with
              related educational materials and a website that will provide the target
              audience an opportunity to access extensive on-line resources and activities. 
              The project will provide community outreach and professional development for
              educators in museums, community groups, schools and libraries. 

The project
              is designed for thirty-six months' duration.  In year one, a network of
              collaborators in the Boston area will focus on research and development; in
              year two, project materials will be piloted and evaluated in six cities, and
              on-line professional development programs will be conducted; and in year three,
              project materials will be disseminated directly to 60 sites and more broadly
              via the internet.
