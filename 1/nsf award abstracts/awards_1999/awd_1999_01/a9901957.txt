Abstract    :
              The data structure that is frequently used in image processing is based upon the
              Euclidean Fourier analysis and lacks projectively covariant characteristics. 
              That is, although one can reconstruct a pattern that is translated and rotated
              in an image plane using only one Fourier transform of the original pattern,
              when projective distortions are applied this is no longer feasible.

Recently
              the Principal Investigator has developed a complete projective Fourier analysis
              consisting of noncompact and compact pictures corresponding to standard and
              spherical Fourier analyses, respectively.  This harmonic analysis is
              well-suited for developing algorithms for storing and processing visual
              information that can be used in automated systems for pattern recognition
              independent of different perspectives between planar objects (i.e., patterns)
              and the imaging systems.  In particular, the analysis allows reconstruction of
              any perspective distortions of a pattern by using only the projective Fourier
              transform in the noncompact picture of the original (undistorted) pattern,
              which was demonstrated in numerical tests.  Moreover, the convolutions in both
              pictures can be used to develop algorithms for projectively-invariant matching
              of patterns.

This project will develop
- a fast algorithm for rendering any
              perspective distortions of a pattern using efficiently computed projective
              Fourier transforms in the non-compact picture of the original pattern; and
- a
              fast algorithm for computing projective Fourier transform in the compact
              picture.

Algorithms for efficient computation of the convolutions in
              noncompact and compact pictures would follow from the both fast projective
              transforms and their inverses.
