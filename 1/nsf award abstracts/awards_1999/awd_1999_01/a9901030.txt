With software, and software failures, ever more a part of
              everyday life, quality software at acceptable cost is a significant concern. 
              The objective of the proposed research is to help developers produce better
              software.  To achieve this objective, the proposed research combines three
              important software engineering threads:  system testing, formal methods, and
              mutation analysis.  System testing consumes considerable resources in
              commercial projects, but much of the activity is ad-hoc and unformalized.  The
              proposed research will provide methods to generate system test cases with
              respect to a given model, and also the means to evaluate existing system test
              cases.  Formal methods have enjoyed recent success through advances in model
              checking.  Model checkers are well suited to generating counter examples, which
              can be interpreted as test cases.  The proposed research will provide
              mechanisms that generate and evaluate system test cases with respect to a model
              checking specification.  Mutation analysis is a method to generate and evaluate
              tests with respect to the ability of the tests to distinguish a given artifact
              from a series of minor variations, or mutants, of the artifact.  The proposed
              research seeks to automate mutation analysis for specifications through the use
              of model checkers.
