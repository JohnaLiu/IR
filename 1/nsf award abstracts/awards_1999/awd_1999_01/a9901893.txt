The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Donna R. Francis with support
              for twelve months to work with Dr. Ian R. Walker at Okanagan University College
              in Kelowna, British Columbia.
Dr. Francis will study long-term climate
              dynamics in the Canadian Artic.  She will develop a novel proxy record for
              climate change through the study of aquatic insect fossils (chironomid remains)
              recovered from drill cores to infer temperature. Chironomid studies are a very
              useful proxy climate indicator and this research will extend and further
              develop their application.  The analysis of long cores (85,000 years) from
              Baffin Island will help understand the timing and extent of glacial
              events.
Dr. Walker has been working with chironomidae for 20 years and has
              worked to develop this group into a significant tool for Quaternary
              environmental reconstructions.  He has developed a chironomid palaeotemperature
              inference model, which will benefit this research project.
