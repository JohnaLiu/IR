Abstract    :
              Plant root morphology is determined by the number and shapes of the component
              individual root cells.  Root cell shape is, in turn, the result of
              environmental factors affecting a fundamental genetic program.  Loci involved
              in root cell shape determination have been identified as a result of genetic
              screens to identify root cell shape mutants in the simple plant Arabidopsis
              thaliana.  The phenotypes of a number of these root cell shape mutants are
              ameliorated by reducing effective ethylene levels.  These ethylene-dependent
              cell shape mutants appear to define a pathway (or pathways) in the root that
              interacts with the ethylene signaling pathway(s) to determine final root cell
              shape.  Analyses of the specific roles of each of the components of these two
              pathways will increase our understanding of the process of cell shape
              determination and the regulation of cell growth.
