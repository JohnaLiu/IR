Abstract    :
              In 1999 and 2000, the Cloud and Aerosol Research Group (CARG) of the University
              of Washington will participate in two NASA-funded projects by operating its
              Convair-580 research aircraft in field projects in the Marshall Islands and in
              Southern Africa.  The primary purpose of the NASA experiments is to compare
              airborne, in situ measurements of cloud and aerosol properties with remote
              sensing measurements from satellites.  Taking advantage of the opportunities
              offered by the NASA projects, CARG will undertake additional experiments
              supported by NSF while the Convair-580 is in transit to and from the field
              sites and on location in Southern Africa.  In September 1999, on the return
              from the Marshall Islands, the airplane will be based near Tokyo for about a
              week to carry out several series of measurements of the variation with altitude
              of the physical, chemical, and optical properties of aerosol particles.  The
              intention is to provide data that are comprehensive enough to permit
              comparisons of computed and measured effects of the aerosols on solar radiation
              (so-called radiative "closure" calculations).  The second NSF experiments will
              be in 2000, when CARG and the research aircraft will be participating in
              SAFARI-2000.  The focus will be on the pall of polluted air over the Atlantic
              Ocean off the coast of Southern Africa.  Measurements will be taken to document
              the evolution of the physical and chemical properties of the aerosols and to
              measure vertical profiles as in the earlier Japanese experiments.  
              Collaborating with Dr. Hobbs in these experiments will be several other
              investigators who will bring new instruments for atmospheric measurements.  The
              plan is to evaluate the performance of the instruments in flights around the
              Seattle area before the NASA missions to Japan and Southern Africa.
