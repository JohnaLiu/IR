The Auger Observatory is an international effort to make a
              detailed study of cosmic rays at the highest energies.  The objectives are to
              measure the arrival direction, energy and mass composition of cosmic rays above
              10^19 eV.  The project will employ a hybrid of two established techniques for
              measuring such high energy particles: air fluorescence and a surface array of
              particle detectors. In this proposal the Penn State group requests operating
              and scientific support for the group's role in the Auger project, which
              includes leadership pf the international effort to construct the electronics
              package for the 1600 surface detectors.  The PI is the project's task leader
              for the surface electronics, and the Co-PI has taken a leading role in the
              characterization, selection, and testing of photomultipliers for the surface
              detector stations.  Both plan to work on the triggering, understanding of mass
              composition effects, and interpretation of the Auger data.
