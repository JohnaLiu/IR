Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to determine the soil uptake rate of atmospheric
              carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3), anthropogenic
              trace gases. Data from a temperate forest on Long Island, NY shows that soils
              are a sink for these halocarbons because CCl4 and CH3CCl3 soil gas
              concentrations were reduced significantly in the top layers of the soil as
              compared to the atmospheric concentration. Concentrations of several CFCs
              remained at atmospheric levels over the same depth range suggesting that
              physical processes were not responsible for the observed CCl4 and CH3CCl3
              gradients. Measurements of CCl4 and CH3CCl3 gradients in soil gas from sites
              representative of six major biome areas (cultivated lands, temperate forests,
              temperate grasslands, boreal forests, tropical forests and savannas, and arid
              lands) will be used to obtain a better estimate of the global flux of these
              gases into soils.
