This award supports the PI and graduate students in a
              collaboration with Peter Minnhagen and Peter Olsson of the Department of
              Theoretical Physics at Umea University, Sweden.  The project will focus on the
              numerical simulation of models of vortex lines and point vortices, in order to
              investigate problems relevant to the behavior of high- Tc superconductors and
              superconducting films.  Combining the PI's experience in the equilibrium
              behavior of fluctuating vortex lines in three dimensions with the Swedish
              group's experience in dynamical simulations will make it possible to explore
              several highly topical and relevant problems related to the dynamics of vortex
              lines in high- Tc superconductors.  These include the Josephson plasma
              resonance and the flux-flow resistance in the vortex line liquid.  A major
              component of the collaboration will be the use of specialized supercomputer
              facilities available in Umea, which will greatly broaden the scope of the
              domestic research activities.
