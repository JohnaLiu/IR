Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              develop a novel technique of using silicon (Si) tubes for the production of
              polycrystalline Si.  Bulk polysilicon is currently produced by chemical vapor
              deposition (CVD) of silicon on hot thin crystalline Si rods, whose diameter
              increases with the deposition.  The process is very slow, cannot be scaled up,
              and involves extremely complex and inefficient heating arrangements.  A
              worldwide shortage of polysilicon has resulted from the increase of demand in
              the semiconductor and solar industries.  The tube technology is expected to
              raise yield by allowing deposition on the inside of a large diameter tube,
              reduce energy consumption, simplify the CVD process, and allow easy control of
              the process.  Phase II will focus on modeling, virtual prototyping, and
              manufacture of next-generation CVD systems, and will experiment with growth,
              deposition, and characterization methods.
     Commercial applications are
              expected in the production of polysilicon and will reduce its costs. 
              Polysilicon material is critical for electronics, photovoltaics,
              micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and many other devices.
