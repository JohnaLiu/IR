Abstract    :
              This research project explores the chemistry of atomic carbon with a view toward
              the production of a variety of novel intermediates including carbenes and
              strained cyclic cumulenes.  Selectivity of insertion into the C-H bonds of
              aromatic hydrocarbons will be investigated, as will the reaction of carbon
              vapor with fullerenes.  These latter experiments are designed to isolate and
              trap fullerene cages that have been modified by the addition of atomic and
              molecular carbon.  Access to cyclic allenes is anticipated through their
              generation at low temperatures.

With this Award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues support for the research of
              Professor Philip B. Shevlin of Auburn University.  Professor Shevlin explores
              the chemistry of carbon in its elemental form, unlike forms usually found in
              nature.  Nevertheless, elemental carbon is implicated in the formation of such
              interesting materials as buckyballs (Buckminsterfullerenes), providing
              additional impetus for understanding the reactivity of atomic carbon and the
              reactive intermediates which can be derived from it.
