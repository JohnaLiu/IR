The 8th International Topical Meeting on Optics of Liquid
              Crystals will be held from September 27 - October 1, 1999 in Puerto Rico.  The
              goal of the conference is to provide a forum for the exchange of scientific
              ideas and technolgoical advances in optics and other aspects of liquid crystals
              and related materials.  The NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of
              young  American Scientists.

Puerto Rico itself will greatly benefit by
              hosting such a high profile international meeting.  Great potential for
              technological opportunities exist in the areas of information displays and
              optical communication that are based on materials that exhibit liquid
              crystalline behavior.
