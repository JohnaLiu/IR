Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              develop an electrochemical machining process for final surface finishing of
              hard passive alloys.  Machining of hard passive alloys by traditional methods
              results in either a mechanically or thermally damaged surface layer.  This
              damage adversely affects the properties of the part and must be removed
              manually, a major rate limiting step, requiring greater than 25% of total
              production time .  The novel modulated reverse electric field electrochemical
              machining process (MREF-ECM) avoids the considerable tangible and intangible
              costs associated with the current finishing process and utilizes benign
              electrolytes.  Phase I demonstrated the technical and economical feasibility
              using surface damaged INCONEL coupons.  Phase II work will validate the
              MREF-ECM process using INCONEL and MONEL parts provided by an industrial
              partner.  Tooling, fixtures, and a three-axis ECM machine will be fabricated,
              and the technical and economic benefits of the MREF-ECM process will be
              validated.  
     In the manufacturing setting, electrolyte disposal and
              worker exposure issues will be eliminated.  The process is applicable to parts
              finishing in the aerospace, automotive, tool and die, medical implements, and
              hot forging industries.
