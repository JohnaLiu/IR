Abstract    :
              This work is a combination of laboratory studies, calculation of infrared
              parameters for atmospheric NO emitters, and analysis of nightglow sky spectra
              made by the Keck 10-meter telescope on Mauna Kea, showing features normally
              associated only with dayglow or aurora.  In the laboratory work, the PIs plan
              to investigate whether the upper state of the O2 metastable states,
              particularly in high vibrational levels.  Two NO metastable states are expected
              to be copiously generated in aurorae by electron impact, based on recent
              electron scattering measurements.  Because both of these states are
              infrared-active, they should contribute to infrared emission in auroral and
              disturbed environments.  The PIs plan to calculate the IR radiative parameters
              for these states.  The sky spectra from the Keck telescope are expected to
              provide new information.  Detection of elemental potassium and the atomic
              oxygen transitions at 7774 A and 8446 A has shown that features normally
              associated with the dayglow are also observable at night, although with far
              lower intensities.  The PIs plan to determine the temporal variability of these
              features and to model their intensities in order to clarify their production
              mechanisms under conditions quite different from those studied until now.
