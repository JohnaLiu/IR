Abstract    :
              This research effort is focused on the development of stable dielectric
              passivation layers for compound semiconductor devices with novel precursors and
              deposition techniques.  Compound semiconductor devices with novel precursors
              and deposition techniques.  Compound semiconductor materials show promise for
              high speed, high power microelectronics applicaitons.  Device passivation with
              a low defect, thermally stable dielectric layer is a prerequisite for reliable,
              long term integrated circuit performance.  Through the use of novel precursors,
              the PI will attempt to minimize hydrogen inclusion which can lead to
              instabilities, in III-V materials.  The use of deuterium and fluorine based
              precursors will be used in the production fo silicon nitride compunds.  Both
              radio frequency and microwave plasma reactors will be used and the effects of
              various deposition strategies will be evaluated.  Optical emission and mass
              spectrscopy will be used to understand the plasma chemistry.  FTIR and XPS will
              be the techniques for the  the examination fo the bonding of varous chemical
              groups.  TEM will be used to examine the mechanism of failure analysis.  The
              topic fo the proposed research is a serious issue for the advanced
              semiconductor device community.  Progress in identifying a low temperature
              process to make better dielectric passivation layers could be a considerable
              technological and economic benefit for a wide variety of computational and
              electronic control applications..
