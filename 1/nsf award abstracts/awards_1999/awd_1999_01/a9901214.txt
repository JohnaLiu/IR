This award supports Michael Adams and a graduate student from
              the University of Wisconsin-Madison in a collaboration with H. Kausch of the
              Institute for Hydrobiology and Fisheries Sciences at the University of Hamburg,
              Germany. The research will focus on ecological changes in the river Elbe since
              the reunification of Germany.  The dramatic, on-going changes in eastern
              Germany (industrial development in the post-reunification era) are having
              important effects on the Elbe River, the major river of the region.  A second
              component of the research will be to study the river floodplain forest ecology
              in the stretches of the Elbe near Dessau in the former East Germany.  That
              region of the floodplain contains the most important and well-preserved remnant
              of old-growth floodplain forests in central Europe.  The collaboration of the
              German partners is indispensable to the collection and interpretation of the
              data.  The research will be the subject of the graduate student's doctoral
              dissertation.
