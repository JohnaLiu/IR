Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is twofold.
              First, integrate computer hardware and software, developed in Phase I, to
              automate a sophisticated fluorescence microscope to allow for automated slide
              scanning/image acquisition and processing to identify and enumerate circulating
              prostate cancer cells, based on various fluorescent markers. Blood samples from
              normal and cancer patients will be used to validate the accuracy and efficiency
              of the automated microscope by comparing automated cell identification (with a
              cell recognition algorithm) and manual cell identification ,i.e., the human
              eye.
Second, data obtained with the markers will be entered into the Cell
              Works database (to be completed in Phase II) along with clinical history of the
              blood donors ( PSA level, mortality, etc.) for validation of the database.
              Correlation between cancer cell data and patient PSA level will be made.
    
              A potential commercial application is to assist, in conjunction with the
              Prostate Cancer Circulating Cell Test, in determining metastasis in a cancer
              patient. The technology will enable Cell Works to more quickly, efficiently,
              and accurately perform a substantial number of circulating cell tests and
              correlate circulating cells with metastasis, and will greatly increase the
              ability to commercialize the CC Test.
