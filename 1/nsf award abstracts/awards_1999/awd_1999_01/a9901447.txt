Multiple controls upon forminiferal oxygen isotope
              values limit our understanding of transient (~105 yr) climate extremes during
              the Late Paleocene Thermal Maximum and Eocene-Oligocene "Greenhouse-Icehouse"
              transition.  The study will couple Mg:Ca ratios of foramifera, demonstrated to
              be highly temperature-dependent, with existing foraminiferal oxygen isotope
              records of these events.  As seawater Mg:Ca over such time-scales is
              effectively constant, this comparative approach will provide a means to (1)
              partition temperature and seawater oxygen isotope (i.e., salinity) dynamics
              during the LPTM and (2) partition temperature and seawater oxygen isotope
              (i.e., ice-volume) dynamics during the Eocene-Oligocene transition.  Such data
              is critical for testing existing paleoclimate hypotheses, understanding the
              mechanism of rapid climate change, and integrating environmental and biological
              components of Earth history.
