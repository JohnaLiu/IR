Abstract    :
              This standard award is for support of a PostDoc to work with the PI on his
              ongoing research whose objective is to apply advanced techniques from machine
              learning and information theory to study the problem of protein structure
              prediction.  The techniques to be used include the utilization of intelligent
              ways of constructing useful composite attributes, and the dynamic reallocation
              of search effort as better approaches become recognized.  Such techniques
              cannot be used blindly, but must be tailored to the special requirements of
              scientific discovery.  The results of this work should have broad applicability
              to many aspects of automated and semi-automated scientific discovery, but the
              specific focus - understanding protein folding - is in itself extremely
              important to both protein chemists and society, because it will open new
              opportunities for research and medicine.  Also, demonstrating a general
              technique for computer-aided scientific model design should help scientists in
              a variety  of scientific disciplines, as they record more data than they can
              meaningfully analyze manually.
