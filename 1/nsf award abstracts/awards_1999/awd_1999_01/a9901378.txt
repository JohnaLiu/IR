Abstract    :
              9901378
This research project stems from the results and conclusions of a
              previous study on the environmental deterioration of high-strength bridge wires
              and it focuses on the initiation of the corrosion process and on the subsequent
              crack formation and propagation mechanism and their interaction with the
              mechanical stresses. The main purpose of this project is to answer the
              difficult question of "why are there broken wires in the main cables of
              suspension bridges in service conditions"?
	The research project will focus on
               1) the initiation and location of the corrosion process in bridge wires,  2)
              the effects and importance of residual stresses and their superposition with
              service stresses, 3) the lever of service loads that wires can carry and their
              interaction with the corrosion process, and on  4) the galvanizing process and
              wire manufacturing. Particular attention will be given to 1) crack formation
              and distribution of residual stresses,  2) corrosion initiation and pitting and
              their relation to microcracks, residual stresses and material flaws,  3) the
              fundamental interrelation between mechanical stresses, corrosion initiation and
              propagation and hydrogen embrittlement, and  4) the effects of wire
              manufacturing on the distribution of residual stresses.
