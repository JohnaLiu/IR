Abstract    :
              Micro-electro-mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology has demonstrated the
              capability of batch fabricating micron-sized sensor and actuator systems. The
              availability of stable MEMS fabrication processes has fueled an increase in
              MEMS design complexity, and highlighted the need for CAD tools to aid in design
              verification. This project is developing algorithms for automated extraction of
              MEMS elements and components needed for design verification. These algorithms
              rely on (1) geometric information to analyze shapes, size, and connectivity of
              various mechanical elements; (2) strength of material based estimations to
              assess relative stiffness of various components (3) connectivity with
              electronic interface to identify functionality of various mechanical
              components. This research investigates the following. Determining mechanical
              component representations that are suitable for interfacing with existing
              representations of electronic components. Evaluating the efficiency of
              simulation models derived from a spatial representation. Exploring approaches
              to trade-off simulation efficiency versus simulation accuracy in extraction
              algorithms. Finding soundness guarantees in the extraction algorithms for a
              wide variety of MEMS devices.
