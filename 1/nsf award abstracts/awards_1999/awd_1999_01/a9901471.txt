Abstract    :
              This project will use laboratory and numerical modelling to develop a sediment
              transport model that can predict both onshore and offshore transport of sand on
              beaches.  No existing model can explain post-storm recovery of beaches and
              therefore it is not possible to predict the long-term cycle of beach erosion
              and recovery resulting from storms.  A wave tank will be used to simulate the
              effects of irregular waves upon equilibrium beaches, and beadload transport
              will be estimated from the equilibrium vales.  A second set of experiments will
              then assess effects under non-equilibrium conditions, to evaluate performance
              of the model.
