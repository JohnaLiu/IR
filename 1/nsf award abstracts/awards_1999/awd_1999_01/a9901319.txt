Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the examination of the synthetic utility of chiral
              allenylmetallic reagents of tin, boron, titanium, chromium and palladium.
              Particular attention will be focused on SE' additions to aldehydes as a route
              to enantioenriched propargylic and allenic carbinols.  Among the issues to be
              addressed are:  The conformational and regiochemical stability of chiral
              allenyl and propargyl organometallics, the stereochemistry and regiochemistry
              of SE' additions involving these reagents, the effect of ligands on the
              enantioselectivity and regioselectivity of SE' additions with these reagents
              and the possible applications of these reagents in natural products
              synthesis.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research of  Dr. James A. Marshall of the Department
              of Chemistry at the University of Virginia.  Professor Marshall will focus his
              work on the development of new synthetic methodology for the preparation of
              chiral carbon compounds by the use of chiral allenyl reagents of tin, boron,
              titanium, chromium and palladium.  These novel intermediates have potential for
              use in the construction of natural products of interest to the pharmaceutical
              and agricultural  industries.
