START will encourage and promote increased participation
              by
scientists and research institutions of developing countries in
global
              change research research supportive of the World Climate
Research Programme
              (WCRP), especially its emerging Climate
Variability study (CLIVAR); the
              International Geosphere-Biosphere
Programme (IGBP); and the International
              Human Dimensions Program
(IHDP).  Specific START activities over a five-year
              period will
focus on: climate variability and change and their
              impacts,
especially on water resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity in
              the
lands of the Kalahari region; modelling of the Asian monsoon system
with
              special emphasis on Asian ecosystems; pilot studies of the
relationship
              between climate variability and agricultural
productivity in sub-Saharan and
              tropical Africa and Southeast Asia;
changing land use and climate variability
              and their impact on water
resources and river inputs to coastal areas in
              Southeast Asia;
African contributions to chemical changes in the atmosphere
              through
biomass burning and desertification; acid deposition and
              health
effects of aerosols; greenhouse gas emissions related to land use
and
              land cover change; and industrial transformations and their
relationship to
              sustainability.  Capacity building will be promoted
through scientific
              planning and training workshops and related
activities and guest lecturer
              programs.  Efforts to improve
linkages between research and policy-making will
              be strengthened
through regional fora on science and policy; workshops on the
              role,
planning and use of assessments; and workshops on the synthesis
              of
research results.  Data management activities will include
development of
              datasets in CD format for Southeast and Temperate
East Asia and development of
              a data and information management
system (DIS) for global change in Southeast
              Asia.
