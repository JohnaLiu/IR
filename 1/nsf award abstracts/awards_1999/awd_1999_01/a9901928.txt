This study investigates the effects of seed
              dispersal by bats and river meander succession on the population dynamics of a
              timber tree, Calophyllum brasiliense, in the Manu Biosphere Reserve of 
              Amazonian Peru. As a river meanders, a system of ridges and depressions
              develops that creates new open soil areas. A spatially structured landscape may
              favor a particular type of seed dispersal system. This study will combine field
              data and modeling to investigate the role of bats as dispersal agents: do they
              confer advantage by distance (colonization) or by the specificity of seed
              deposition (directed dispersal)?  Field studies will investigate: (1) spatial
              relationships of habitat types and rate of new habitat creation by the river;
              (2) recruitment requirements, rates of survival, growth and reproduction of  C.
              brasiliense, in study plots of differing habitat types; (3) seed deposition
              patterns created by bats, including direct observations and radio telemetry. 
              

The benefit that bats provide to large-seeded tropical tree species has
              never been thoroughly studied, even though many large-seeded tropical trees
              depend on bats to disperse their seeds. Tropical rainforest dynamics driven by
              river meanders have received much less study than tree-fall gap dynamics,
              although river meanders may be a predominant cause of successional processes
              throughout the Amazon basin. Understanding dispersal, recruitment and
              demography of C. brasiliense will have applications to its exploitation as a
              sustainable timber resource.
