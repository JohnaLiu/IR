Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops
              anode catalysts for PEM fuel cells operating with reformed hydrogen.  Noble
              metal clusters will be finely dispersed onto new, high surface area conductive
              ceramic supports developed at T/J Technologies.  Catalysts prepared during
              phase I showed high carbon monoxide (CO)-tolerance for a hydrogen anode
              operating with a fuel stream containing up to 200 ppm CO, superior to
              commercially available carbon-supported catalysts.  The Phase II technical
              approach for optimizing these catalysts includes:  (1) platinum particle size
              control by exploiting the strong interaction between platinum and the ceramic
              support;  (2) surface modification of the ceramic support;  and (3)
              simplification of the catalyst preparation procedure.  This approach will
              reduce total precious metal content, as well as improve durability and simplify
              the dispersion process.  In parallel, prototype membrane electrode assemblies
              will be constructed.  Complete fuel cells will be assembled and tested in
              collaboration with commercial developers of integrated fuel cells.
     By
              reducing noble metal content and improving durability, this research will
              improve the commercial viability of fuel cells operating on reformed
              hydrocarbon fuels.  Primary commercial markets are vehicle propulsion and
              kW-scale off grid or portable power supplies.  Global fuel cell markets are
              projected to exceed $3 billion by 2000.
