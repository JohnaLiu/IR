LICHTENSTEIN

Lichtenstein Creative Media is producing a national
              public radio series that examines recent advances at the frontiers of brain
              research and explores the scientific, behavioral, medical and social/ethical
              implications of those advances.  "The Infinite Mind" is a weekly, one-hour
              program hosted by Dr. Frederick K. Goodwin, former director of the National
              Institute of Mental Health and head of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental
              Health Administration.  He is an internationally recognized authority on the
              brain and behavior.  While each program will focus on one specific topic (e.g.,
              "How Children Learn"), the series covers a full spectrum of issues involving
              the human brain.  The format for the programs includes documentary segments,
              interviews and discussions with research scientists, listener call-ins, guest
              essays and special reports.
