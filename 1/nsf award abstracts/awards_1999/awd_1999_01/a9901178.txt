The observable universe contains matter, but no antimatter. A
              satisfactory explanation of this feature does not exist. All solutions require
              new sources of time reversal violation. This means that there exist unseen
              reactions of elementary particles that proceed at different rates going forward
              in time as compared to going backward in time. One project of this proposal is
              to search for such a reaction via positive kaon decay at the KEK facility in
              Japan.
Neutrons and protons, called nucleons, are with electrons the particles
              that make up ordinary matter. A complete quantitative description of their
              structure is wanting. Via the study of the interactions of polarized gamma rays
              with polarized nucleons, various structure dependent effects can be measured
              and compared with theory. The LEGS facility of Brookhaven National Laboratory
              has developed gamma ray beams of unprecedented polarization, and is developing
              HD ice targets that will provide the highest nucleon polarization. A large
              acceptance detector has been installed to measure the various final states such
              interactions lead to.
