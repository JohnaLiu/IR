Abstract    :
              The synthesis and layout of control (random) logic blocks for future 1 GHz
and
              beyond clock frequencies will be a major bottleneck in future digital
system
              design. The research that is proposed here exactly addresses this
problem by
              seeking to determine how to synthesize and layout the absolute
fastest
              possible transistor-based implementations of control logic
networks. It
              focuses on enabling each step in the design automation flow to
find circuit
              implementations of maximum possible speed. In particular, what
is being
              examined carefully is the choice of logic family, the degree and
type of logic
              minimization, new technology mapping algorithms, and new
layout strategies
              that make control logic network layouts look similar to
datapath layouts. The
              primary outcome of this research will be a complete
design automation flow
              consisting of a suite of optimized and efficient
computer-aided design tools,
              and an optimized Clock-Delayed domino logic
family that together will
              synthesize and layout extremely reliable,
mainstream control logic block
              implementations that are two to three times
faster than what is possible with
              static CMOS.
