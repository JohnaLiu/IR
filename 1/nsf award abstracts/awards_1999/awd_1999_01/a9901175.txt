This U.S.-Hungry research project between Thomas Burr of
              Cornell University and Sandor Sule of the Institute for Plant Protection,
              Hungarian Academy of Sciences, features pursuit of microbial germplasm from
              wild Hungarian vine plants, Vitis vulpina and V. sylvestris, preserve samples
              for study of their biological control mechanisms and to determine whether they
              possess encoded genetic determinants on plasmids.  The researchers know that
              the subject Agrobacterium vitis chromosome contains several genes that are
              unique to the Hungarian species. Therefore, the A. vitis strains they collect
              will be characterized by molecular analysis, compared with others in a
              worldwide collection, and then measured for diversity by DNA fingerprinting and
              RAPD analysis.  Recovered nontumorigenic A. vitis strains from Hungary will be
              evaluated as biological controls of crown gall tumors in grapes and as a source
              of genes for the eventual construction of transgenic plants resistant to the
              devastating disease.   Results from this examination of the Agrobacterium-plant
              association should improve our understanding of: 1) plant tumorigenesis and its
              control by biological methods and 2) plant host-parasite interactions in
              general.  If successful, these findings may lead to practical applications in
              agriculture.

This project in plant biology fulfills the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and
              Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
