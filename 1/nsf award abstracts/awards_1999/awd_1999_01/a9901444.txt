The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Anita L. Davelos with support
              for twenty-four months to work with Dr. Jeremy J. Burdon at CSIRO in Canberra,
              Australia.  The second year is being supported with funds provided by the
              U.S.-Australia Program.
Dr. Davelos will examine two aspects of plant-pathogen
              interactions using a natural system plant-pathogen system. She will work with
              Dr. Burdon and his group to address the effects of mating system on the
              population structure in plant-pathogen metapopulations.  Their two objectives
              are 1) Assess how host mating system affects the response to pathogen pressure
              and 2) Assess how pathogen mating system affects pathogen population structure.
               Plant pathogens can influence plant community diversity and species
              distributions through their effects on fitness and the outcome of intra- and
              inter-specific competition.
Dr. Burdon is a world leader in the study of
              plant-pathogen interactions in natural systems.
