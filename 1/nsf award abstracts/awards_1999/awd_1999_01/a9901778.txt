Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              develop rapid electronic sortation of different nonferrous alloys.  Phase II
              will design and build a near full-scale prototype from the Phase I laboratory
              model.  The prototype will be used to test and evaluate large samples of
              non-ferrous alloys.   Substantial benefits are expected in electronic sortation
              (by X-ray fluorescence) over existing methods, which use hand sorting, eddy
              currents, and heavy media plants.  Hand sorting is expensive and labor
              intensive; eddy current devices are both size- and shape-dependent and do not
              work well with incinerated metals; and media plants are capital intensive and
              aggravate environmental problems.  Electronic sortation may reduce capital
              costs and thus make nonferrous recovery more available to small businesses.
  
                The new electronic sortation technology will reduce the substantial
              quantities of mixed nonferrous feedstock that presently go to landfills.  There
              are some 200 waste-to-energy facilities as well as 200 scrap yards and
              automobile shredders in the U.S., which could benefit from electronic
              sortation.  The potential U.S. market for nonferrous recovery is estimated at
              $2.5 billion peryear.  Applications of this technology internationally would
              substantially increase the potential market.
