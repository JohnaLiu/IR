Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II will develop a
              continuous manufacturing process from powder preparation through mechanical
              deformation and heat treatment for BSSCCO-2212 wires and tapes.  It is expected
              that long length multifilamentary BSCCO-2212 with micro-size filaments will be 
              cost/performance competitive with Nb3Sn.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility
              of fabricating a cost-effective, high performance multi-filamentary
              BSCCO-2212/silver alloy wire with filament diameters of 2-4 microns by using
              partially automated BSCCO-2212 chemical preparation and a continuous heat
              treatment.  Phase II will concentrate on complete automation of the powder
              process through calcination and optimization of the continuous heat treatment
              for long conductors.  The powder process will be further optimized based on
              Phase I results which indicate that nano-sized BSCCO-2212 particles may result.
                A  cost minimization study will be performed on lesser purity materials, the
              effect of automation on labor costs, and the reduction of overall processing
              times.  Alternative packaging methods for BSSCO powders will be investigated to
              defeat carbon uptake, improve ease of handling, and control packing density in
              the wires.
     Commercial availability of cost effective, high-performance,
              multifilamentary BSCCO-2212 wires will enable the production of a new
              generation of electric power transformers and high field magnets or magnet
              inserts capable of operation at fields in excess of 20 Tesla.  These devices
              will impact the economic efficiency of the electric power industry as well as
              future developments in high energy physics, advanced MRI (or NMR) analysis, and
              energy storage devices.
