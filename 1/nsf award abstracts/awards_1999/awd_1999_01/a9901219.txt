The proposer  will continue to construct the homotopy theory
              of
algebraic varieties. As of today we know how to define the stable
              and
unstable homotopy categories for algebraic varieties and the
fundamental
              cohomology theories such as the ordinary (=motivic)
cohomology, K-theory and
              cobordisms. The analogs of other basic 
ingredients of theordinary homotopy
              theory, such as the Steenrod 
operations in ordinarycohomology, are also
              partly understood. 
During this stage of the project the main attack will be
              made on 
two other ingredients which are so far missing; these are the duality
              
theory and the recognition principle for T-loop spaces.

Homotopy theory of
              algebraic varieties is an approach to the study of
algebraic varieties (=
              systems of algebraic equations) based on an
analogy. This analogy exists
              between the abstract categorical
properties of the affine line (= the system
              of equations with one
variable and no equations) and the toplogical space
              [0,1] called the
unit interval. Using it one can translate methods of homotopy
              theory 
from topological spaces to algebraic varieties which gives new tools
              
to deal with problems in algebraic geometry and number theory.
