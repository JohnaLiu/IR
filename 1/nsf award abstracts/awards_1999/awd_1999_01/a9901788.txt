Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on
              the development of novel nanostructured polymer/inorganic hybrid membranes with
              significantly improved permeability and organic vapor/permanent gas
              selectivity.  Separation of hydrocarbon vapors from the permanent gases,
              hydrogen, nitrogen and methane, are growing applications of membrane gas
              separation processes throughout  the U.S.  Approximately 50 units have been
              installed in the last few years.  Current systems use silicone rubber composite
              membranes, but membranes with higher selectivities would significantly improve
              the competitiveness of the process.  The objective of this research will be to
              develop filled polyacetylene-based membranes.  The Phase I project demonstrated
              that these membranes are significantly more selective than silicone rubber as
              well as confirming higher permeabilities.  These membranes separate by a
              completely different mechanism than silicone rubber and could transform the
              competitiveness of vapor/gas separating membranes.  The Phase II project will
              focus on (1) membrane optimization and scale-up, (2) elucidation of the unique
              gas transport properties of the nanostructured membranes, and (3) bench-scale
              experiments to demonstrate the practicality of using these membranes to
              separate industrially important gas mixtures.
     Applications of the
              membranes to be developed in this project include recovery of propylene,
              ethylene, vinyl chloride, and other monomers from nitrogen purge streams;
              separation of light hydrocarbons from hydrogen in refineries; and separation of
              C+3 hydrocarbons from methane during natural gas processing.
