Cooperative caching
              techniques have been successfully used to improve the performance of
              distributed file systems and the Web.   By replacing more expensive access to a
              "far away" data with a more efficient access to a "near by" cached copy, and by
              coordinating the content of caches, these techniques improve the overall system
              performance and scalability.

Cooperative caching techniques have bot been
              used for transactional object systems.  A principal goal of the proposed work
              is to design, implement and evaluate cooperative caching techniques for
              transactional object storage systems.  These techniques will enable
              construction of wide-area storage systems that will provide applications with
              the reliability and consistency guarantees of transactions, the flexibility is
              user-defined objects, and still be scalable.

A major contribution of this
              work will be a set of new transactional cooperative cache consistency protocols
              for wide-area environment, global cache coordination protocols that adapt to
              object granularity, and security techniques that protect objects in cooperative
              caches.  The technique will be incorporated into the Thor object storage
              system.  This work encompasses both early research and development and
              prototyping.
