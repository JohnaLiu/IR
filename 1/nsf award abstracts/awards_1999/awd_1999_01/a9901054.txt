Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to use a combination of experiment and
              theory/simulations to study protein aggregation as a competitive process to
              folding at high protein concentrations.  One strategy will be to study, by
              experiment, the influence of specific interactions between amino acid residues
              and secondary structure on the stability of aggregates vs. the native
              three-dimensional structure.  A secondary strategy will be to determine, from
              computer simulations and theory, the general characteristics of minimal models
              of heterogeneous polymers that can either aggregate or fold.
