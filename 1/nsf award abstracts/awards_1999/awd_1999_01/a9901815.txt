Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              develop a prototype Micro-Optic 
Spectroscopic Imaging Sensor (MOSIS), based
              on a polarization sensitive, diffractive micro-optic array.  
The MOSIS
              prototype will be a miniature, lightweight monolithic device capable of
              multi-spectral, polarimetric imaging in real time.  MOSIS is a simple
              focal-plane array device consisting of a stack of three basic elements: a
              refractive microlens array; a pair of conjugate birefringent diffractive optics
              arrays; and a 2-D detector array, which can be a commercial CCD chip.  Phase I
              demonstrated the feasibility of MOSIS technology by developing an analytical
              model and computer simulation, and through experimental evaluation of polymers
              and birefringent materials and demonstration of the concept by fabricating a
              birefringent diffractive optical element.  Phase II will optimize the MOSIS
              design, increasing the performance efficiency of the device and packaging it
              into a compact prototype with 256x256 pixels, 6 to 12 simultaneous spectral
              polarimetric channels, wide field-of-view, and a high speed spectral signature
              processor for real-time spectral image sensing and identification.  The MOSIS
              module can be integrated simply into an existing remote sensing digital video
              camera system without major modification or effect on image quality.
    
              Commercial applications are expected in compact, low-cost, reliable,
              polarimetric imaging, multispectral sensor systems for remote sensing,
              including ocean monitoring, environmental sensing, mineral identification,
              agricultural surveillance, and for biomedical and chemical spectroscopic
              imaging, industrial inspection, fire fighting, and law enforcement.
