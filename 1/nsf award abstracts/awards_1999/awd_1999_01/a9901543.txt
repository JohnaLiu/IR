The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Wendy L. Banka with support for
              twelve months to work with Dr. Stephen Cohen at the European Molecular Biology
              Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany.
Dr. Banka's goal is to understand
              the molecular basis of pattern formation in the Drosophila leg. She will
              identify the genes involved in leg development by combining a systematic gain
              of function screen with a suppressor screen and to characterize their role in
              development of the leg.
Dr. Cohen's lab is well-equipped for this research,
              having considered a wide range of patterning questions for many years using
              both standard genetic and molecular biological techniques.  Its location at
              EMBL will provide Dr. Banka with exposure to numerous projects and researchers
              as it is an international institute supported by 14 European countries and
              Israel.
