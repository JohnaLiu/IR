Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will utilize
              Cytomatrix's three-dimensional biomatrix, Cellfoam, as the foundation of a stem
              cell cryopreservation system that pre-selects and cryopreserves hematopoietic
              progenitor cells (HPCs) in a single, integrated device. Phase I research
              demonstrated that Cellfoam mediates the enrichment of HPCs from unfractionated,
              ficoll purified mononuclear, and CD34+ selected cells during pre-culture and
              maintains their viability and functional capacity during cryopreservation.
              Building on these feasibility findings, Phase II will develop a Cellfoam
              cryopreservation prototype by addressing the following aims: 1) Optimization of
              pre-culture reagents, including culture media; 2) Optimization of
              cryopreservation protocols, including cryopreservation solutions; 3) Evaluation
              of the in vivo engraftment capabilities of HPCs using an NOD/SCID mouse model.
              The work will demonstrate the ability of Cellfoam to foster HPC enrichment and
              cryopreservation for clinical applications, such as long-term stem cell storage
              and bone marrow transplantation, for which current approaches are not
              optimal.
      Commercialization of Cellfoam systems for the first-ever
              integrated selection, storage and modification system for HPCs is anticipated
              to meet the needs of growing markets in cord blood storage, bone marrow
              transplantation and gene therapy.  The markets are forecast to exceed US$600
              million annually in the next decade.
