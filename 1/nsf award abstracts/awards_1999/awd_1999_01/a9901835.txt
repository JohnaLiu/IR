Abstract    :
              The IEEE Information Theory Workshop in any specific area is held annually
              either in the United States of America or abroad.  In l999, there will be two
              workshops to be held abroad. The first one is in the area of information theory
              and communications and will be held in Kruger National Park, South Africa, June
              20-25, l999.  The second one is in the area of information theory and
              networking and will be held in Metsovo, Greece June 27-July 1, l999.  The
              organizers of both workshops are coordinating their arrangements such that all
              interested participants will be able to attend both events.

Papers presented
              in these twin workshops will be of particular importance to research and
              applications of interest to the National Science Foundation.  The areas covered
              in these twin workshops are:

Information Theory and Communications:
              Identification; Cryptology and communications security; Source coding theory
              and techniques; Modeling and performance of high speed networks; Multi-user
              communications; Coding and modulation for fading channels; Spread-spectrum
              communication theory and techniques; New results in information theory and
              coding.

Information Theory and networking: Network Shannon information
              theory; Source coding; Information theory and queuing; Fundamentals of
              networks; Cryptography and security; Coding and communications; Role of
              information theory in multimedia; Role of information theory in networking;
              Pricing in networks.
