Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is directed
              toward the fabrication and performance evaluation of a new generation of oxygen
              anion conducting solid electrolytes.  These new materials, derived from the
              brownmillerite solid state structure, are being selected because of their near
              term potential for achieving higher oxygen anion conductivity and chemical
              stability than currently technically available materials. Technology emerging
              in this program will enable improved performance for:   (1) electrically driven
              atmospheric oxygen separation;  (2) intermediate temperature Solid Oxide Fuel
              Cells (SOFCs); and, (3) fast response chemical sensors, to give but a few
              examples. Both electrolytic oxygen separation and SOFC technology will be made
              economically more competitive by lowering present severe materials hardware
              constraints resulting from high operating temperatures associated with the use
              of Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) solid electrolyte. Moderate temperature
              electrochemical devices based upon such advanced solid electrolytes will also
              have the added advantage of requiring less expensive hardware components for
              their commercial implementation.  Work to this stage in the program has
              identified oxygen anion conducting solid electrolytes which possess:   (1)
              excellent chemical stability under simultaneous oxidizing and reducing
              conditions;  (2) insignificant parasitic electronic conductivity; and, (3) an
              oxygen anion conductivity approximately twice that of YSZ from DC measurements,
              representative of those conditions anticipated in electrochemical
              devices.
Work being performed in this program will result in clarifying a new
              generation of oxygen anion conducting electrolytes which are anticipated to
              find commercial application in intermediate temperature electrochemical
              devices, such as electrolytic oxygen generators, fuel cells, and chemical
              sensors.
