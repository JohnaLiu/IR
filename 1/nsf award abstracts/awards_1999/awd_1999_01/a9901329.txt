This award funds a Dissertation Enhancement Grant for
              Matthew V. Thompson, Harvard University, under the direction of Dr. Noel M.
              Holbrook, for a study on the mechanism of drought tolerance of Nolana flaccida,
              a plant native to the Atacama Desert of Chile, considered the driest place in
              the world. This perennial shrub can survive decade-long periods without rain,
              thriving and flowering while individuals of other species (except cacti) lie
              dead or dormant.  The only two main sources of water for the plants in this
              region are the rain water immediately following  ENSO events (El Nino Southern
              Oscillation), and water derived from thermal vapor diffusion during periods of
              extended drought, which sometimes last for ten years.
 
The study will
              address the mechanisms by which the Nolana flaccida plant is able to survive in
              this inhospitable environment.  The two hypotheses to be tested will be
              centered on the soil processes that provide water to the plants in this system,
              and on the use of salt by the plant to improve the water use of its leaves. In
              addition, to tie these two processes together, they will look at the rate of
              delivery of salt through the plant, its natural concentration in the soil at
              various depths, and how fast it must be delivered to be maintained at the high
              concentrations found.

The study of this model system will add to the array
              of adaptations employed by desert plants, and could make significant
              contributions to our understanding of basic phenomena in soil physics.
