Title: Generalized
              Cloud Overlap in the NCAR Community Climate Model

The proposed work will
              investigate cloud overlap in the National Center for Atmospheric Research
              Community Climate Model (NCAR CCM). The plan is (i) to incorporate the modified
              radiative transfer model into the CCM; (ii) to test the sensitivity of climate
              as simulated by the CCM to changes in a length scale, L (related to the cloud
              overlap for two model levels); and (iii) to optimize the climate simulation
              with respect to L. This will provide values of L that are most consistent with
              other physical parameterizations in the CCM. The work is important because it
              will lead to better understanding and modeling of cloud overlap.
