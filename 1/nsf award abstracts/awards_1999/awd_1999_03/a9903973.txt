The southwestern United States
              historically supported extensive riparian cottonwood-willow forests which have
              been reduced by 85% to 98%.  Much of this decline is attributed to flood
              control.  However, little research has addressed the importance of flooding to
              riparian ecosystems in the region. The proposed research project will focus on
              the role of seasonal flooding in maintaining the ecological integrity of native
              riparian forest in the semi-arid Southwest.  We will conduct our research on
              the riparian forests of the Middle Rio Grande in central New Mexico, where we
              will study how historic seasonal flooding affects the ecological integrity of
              native cottonwood riparian forest ecosystems.  We propose that the health of
              riparian ecosystems in this region depends upon periodic flooding.  The
              anticipated results of this research will contribute to better understanding of
              the structure and dynamics of riparian ecosystems and provide critical
              information for their management.
