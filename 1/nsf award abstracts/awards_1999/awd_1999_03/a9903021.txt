Study of active and young deformation in the southern
              Balkans is of particular interest because this region contains the northernmost
              extent of the Aegean extensional domain and is exposed on land unlike most of
              the remainder of the Aegean extensional system.  It provides an example of
              extension in the hanging wall of a zone of coeval subduction along the Hellenic
              subduction boundary.  This project continues research in this region and
              combines geologic and geophysical studies with space geodetic measurments to
              establish the Eocent to Recent extensional tectonic evolution of this sector of
              the Alpine orogeny.  Results ultimately will lead to a three-dimensional
              geodynamic model for the southern Balkan tectonic system and additional insight
              into the dynamic process that drives these systems generally.
