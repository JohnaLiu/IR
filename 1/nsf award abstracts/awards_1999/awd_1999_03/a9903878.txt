The ability to respond to the environment by making appropriate
              changes in morphology or physiology can promote the survival, growth, and
              reproduction of an organism.  Although the ability to respond appropriately to
              environmental changes seems intuitively advantageous, no organism is able to
              produce the optimum morphology and physiology in all possible environments. The
              proposed research will determine what forces can limit the ability of organisms
              to respond appropriately to environmental change.  A plant species, Viola
              septemloba, in which individuals can produce leaves with dramatically different
              morphology will be studied as a model system.  Experiments will be conducted in
              the field to determine if there are costs associated with the ability of
              individuals to alter their leaf morphology in response to seasonal variation in
              the environment.   Such costs could help explain why organisms appear unable to
              respond appropriately to all environments they encounter.  The biological
              mechanisms underlying costs in this system will also be examined.

The
              results of this research will expand our basic understanding of how organisms
              respond to changes in their environment.  Knowledge of the limits to
              environmental response will refine our ability to understand and predict the
              effects of natural disturbances and human impacts on the environment on plants
              and animals.
