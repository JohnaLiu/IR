This project seeks to understand magnetic field generation
              
by the flow of liquid metals (dynamo action) through carefully 
controlled
              experiments in liquid sodium.  The goal is to better  
characterize and to
              better understand the dynamo theory that  
seeks to explain magnetic field
              generation for the Earth and  
other astrophysical bodies.    The research
              plan is to continue  
work on two existing sodium experiments, while
              constructing  
and exploring a new rotating convection experiment.  This new 
              
experiment consists of a rotating inner and outer spherical  
boundary with
              convecting liquid sodium in between.    
Additionally, the investigators will
              undertake a direct comparison between  
these experiments and numerical
              simulations to be performed by  
Gary Glatzmaier at the University of
              California, Santa Cruz.   
These comparisons will afford a direct test of the
              model  
assumptions used in modern simulations of the earth's outer core.
