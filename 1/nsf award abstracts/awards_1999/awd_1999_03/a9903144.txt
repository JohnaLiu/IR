The active convergence between the Indian subcontinent and
              Asia has resulted in the highest mountain range in the world and the occurrence
              of the largest intracontinental earthquakes on record.  The purpose of this
              collaborative research is to combine geologic, geodetic and seismologic
              techniques to study the spatial and temporal pattern of strain accumlation and
              release across the thrust system, and the relationship of that strain pattern
              to the process of continental plate collision.  Results are expected to place
              quantitative constraints on the mechanics of mountain building across the
              Himalaya, and provide insight into the associated seismic hazzard.
