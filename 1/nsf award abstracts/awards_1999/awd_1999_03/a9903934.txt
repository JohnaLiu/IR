This study will develop new methods for analyzing
              evolutionary patterns in continuous characters.  Evolutionary patterns are
              trends over time in the variation and covariation of characters.  Continuous
              characters are a particularly important category of phenotypic traits.  Body
              size, morphological measurements, physiological attributes, and many behavioral
              characteristics show continuous variation in natural populations and are
              referred to as continuous characters.  The methods that will be developed use
              models of inheritance (quantitative inheritance) in which the characters are
              affected by many genetic elements, each of which has a small effect.  To use
              these models, their evolution tendencies must be assayed.  Those assays will be
              accomplished by comparing inheritance of scalation traits in multiple
              populations of closely related species of garter snake
              (Thamnophis).

Although some characters are affected by one or a few genes,
              most characters show quantitative inheritance.  Agriculturally important traits
              such as body size and such medical conditions as schizophrenia are examples of
              traits with quantitative inheritance.  To understand how these traits change
              both in the short term and in the long run, their inheritance systems must be
              studied.  The methods to be developed are among the first to address the issue
              of long term trends in the inheritance of characters affected by many genes.
