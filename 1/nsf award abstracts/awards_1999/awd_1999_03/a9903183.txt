This is a collaborative project to measure vertical
              components of motion across the Southern Alps of New Zealand using both GPS
              geodesy and absolute gravity.  The investigators will install seven continuous
              or semi-continuous GPS instruments along a profile across the Southern Alps
              where the range is especially high, and rates of vertical movement should also
              be high.  They will measure g, using the FG5 gravity instrument at 10 sites,
              both to calibrate and supplement GPS measurements.  Five years of data
              collection should allow a quantification of uplift of benchmarks with respect
              to sea-level, and a test of whether such uplift is compensated by crustal
              thickening or a response to erosional unloading.   Vertical components of
              deformation should contribute to understanding two basic processes in
              continental tectonics; 1) how surface deformation is connected to that at
              depth, and 2) how climate, through erosion, affects tectonics.  The combined
              use of absolute g and GPS geodesy should allow the PIs to distinguish the
              extent to which uplift results from the isostatic response to 1) the removal of
              a surface load and the uplift of the entire crust, or 2) to crustal thickening,
              for which the rate of thickening should be six to seven times the measured rate
              of uplift.  The work involves extensive collaboration and cost sharing with
              international colleagues in New Zealand and elsewhere.
