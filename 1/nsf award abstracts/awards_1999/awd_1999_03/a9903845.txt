Experimental analysis of ecosystem
              mechanisms engendering ungulate spatial concentrations

This research will
              utilize experimental manipulations of nutrient cycling to determine whether it
              is possible to attract large, wild, grazing mammals to new landscape facets
              previously lightly grazed.  Minerals particularly important to the adequate
              nutrition of reproductive animals, pregnant and lactating females and growing
              young, will be added to the soil and their cycling, through plants and animals,
              will be monitored.  The research has applications to both the fundamental
              organization of ecosystems supporting large herds of free-ranging mammalian
              herbivores and to management of mammals subject to severe poaching by illegal
              hunters, since it tests whether it is possible to create animal-favored
              habitats remote from poacher access.
