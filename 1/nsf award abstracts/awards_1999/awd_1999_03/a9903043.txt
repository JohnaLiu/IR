Previous work has developed a new tomographic methodology
              that has been applied to two corridors in the south-central and western Pacific
              to obtain vertical (2D) tomograms of anisotropic shear velocities and
              discontinuity topography.  These tomograms show features that are well
              correlated with topography and the geoid, but not in a manner expected from
              current models of oceanic mantle dynamics; these results thus have potentially
              profound implications for mantle dynamics.  The first priority of the research
              proposed here will be to collect a comprehensive data set for the central and
              western Pacific and to invert these data for a high-resolution 3D model of the
              region.  The data will include the travel times and dispersion characteristics
              of S-type body waves and reflections, upper-mantle guided waves, surface waves,
              and ScS reverberations.  This research will also improve on the inversion
              methodologies in several ways:  1)  by computing 3D sensitivity kernals, 2) by
              extending the inversion techniques to include amplitude variations, which will
              allow investigation of lateral variations in attenuation, and 3) by examining
              the effects of azimuthal anisotropy and its lateral heterogeneity.
