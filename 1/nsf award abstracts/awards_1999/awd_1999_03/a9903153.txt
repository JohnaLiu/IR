Abstract    :
              This is part of a group proposal that seeks funding to continue funding of the
              Princeton Earth Physics Project (PEPP).  This project continues to bring
              hands-on science into the high school classroom, based on a network of
              earthquake recording seismographs.  It is an integrated, real-world endeavor,
              combining experience and practice of scientific data acquisition and analysis,
              cooperation and data sharing on the Internet, and a curriculum which, while
              based on earthquake study, cuts across the disciplinary boundaries of physics,
              geoscience, mathematics and computer sciences.  It is also a program for
              nucleating a 'scientific community" of  PEP teachers, students, and mentors
              from the research community.
