This project will investigate, using an integrated
              geological,
petrological, geochemical, and numerical modeling approach,
              fundamental
processes of fluid flow, heat/mass transport, mineral reaction,
              and
fluid-rock interaction associated with contact metamorphism in the
              Alta
Stock thermal aureole, Alta, Utah.  The objectives of the study are to:
              1)
map the spatial patterns of fluid flux and metamorphic temperatures in
              the
marbles of the Alta Aureole using well-established geochemical
              (oxygen,
carbon, strontium isotopes, boron concentrations) and petrologic
              tracers;
and 2) develop improved numerical models of energy/mass transport
              and
fluid-rock reaction which incorporate the effects of fluid production
              (in
both intrusion and wallrocks), mineral reaction, transient changes
              in
permeability of the wallrocks, and variable igneous contact geometry. 
              The
mapped patterns of metamorphic temperatures and geochemical alteration
              will
be simulated with these numerical models to place quantitative
              constraints
on: 1) the geometry, flux, and timescale of fluid flow in the
              aureole; 2)
the permeabilities and permeability distributions that produce the
              observed
patterns of fluid flux; and 3) the impacts of reaction and
              exchange
kinetics on processes of fluid-rock interaction.  In particular, we
              will
investigate the impacts from fluid production, transient changes
              in
permeability, and from igneous contact geometry on flow patterns and
              fluid
fluxes in this contact metamorphic hydrothermal system.  The computer
              codes
developed, and the new insights generated in this study of the Alta
              aureole
will also be applicable to fluid flow and processes of
              fluid-rock
interaction in other types of crustal hydrothermal systems.
