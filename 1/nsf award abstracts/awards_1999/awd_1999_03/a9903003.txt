The aim of this project is to constrain the magmatic and
              chemical
evolution of the Midcontinent Rift System (MRS).  We will accomplish
              this
with an integrated major- and trace-element, Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf isotopic,
              and
U-Pb geochronological examination of two important components of the
              Duluth
and Beaver Bay intrusive complexes of the MRS in northeast Minnesota:
              (1)
layered mafic intrusions; and (2) large granophyric (hypabyssal
              granitic)
bodies that have been intruded into the upper levels of the
              complexes. 
This portion of the MRS rift is critical for detailed study
              because (1)
much of the entire upper crustal section, including complete
              volcanic
sequences and shallow magma chambers, is exposed which will allow us
              to
examine the genetic relationships between the intrusive and
              extrusive
units; and (2) this region contains numerous felsic units that
              are
volumetrically important in both the volcanic sequences and in
              the
intrusive complexes.  The genesis and timing of these felsic units is
              still
not completely understood and will be a major focus of this proposal.
              
Constraints on the petrogenesis, evolution, and ages of the layered
              mafic
and granophyric intrusions will help refine an integrated model for
              the
evolution of the Midcontinent Rift System.
