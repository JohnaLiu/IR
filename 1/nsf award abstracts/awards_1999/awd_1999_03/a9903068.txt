Abstract    :
                        This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will
              demonstrate stacked organic light emitting device (SOLED) technology in a full
              color, low-cost, low-power display.  Universal Display Corporation (UDC) and
              Princeton University are developing this novel SOLED architecture, where red
              (R), green (G), and blue (B) sub-pixels are vertically positioned to emit any
              mixture of color and brightness, as an efficient, high-performance alternative
              to the existing side-by-side approaches.  Based on vacuum-deposited,
              small-molecule organic thin films, OLED technology is widely recognized for
              high brightness and contrast, fast response time, high power efficiency at low
              operating voltage, and excellent reliability.  Phase I demonstrated saturated,
              'true-color' by optimizing the device layers to reduce microcavity effects.  In
              Phase II the goals are:  (1) improve SOLED display-level performance, (2)
              develop commercially-viable processes, and (3) demonstrate a full-color,
              passive matrix addressed SOLED display.  If successful, this program will
              provide the basis for full-scale commercialization of this innovative low-cost
              display technology.
          This  technology has the potential to serve a
              myriad of consumer electronics (e.g., personal digital assistants, mobile
              communicators and other handheld portable devices), transportation, industrial
              and computing display applications, where low-cost, low-power, full-color
              performance is desired.
