	This project supports the dissertation research of
              an anthropology student from the University of California at Irvine, studying
              the cultural meanings of organ transplantation in Guadalajara, Mexico.  The
              project will examine how culturally construction visions of the body are
              exemplified in this Mexican location, what general Mexican cultural values it
              implies, how these differ from the values in the US, where many of the medical
              specialists have trained, and how these values in practice are influenced by
              the existing social and economic inequalities in Mexico (the most striking
              difference is that in the US transplant organs tend to be derived from
              brain-dead cadavers, while in Mexico family are seen as the appropriate
              source).  Using participant observation, interviewing, consensus modeling,
              statistical analysis of hospital records, and textual analysis of popular
              media, the student will focus on transplant patients, family, hospital staff in
              three different hospitals, one focusing on poor, middle class, and more wealthy
              patients.  This research will advance our understanding of how different
              cultures construct images of the body, and how these images are shaped by
              biomedical theory, and how these issues contribute to our understanding of
              modernity as a concept and its expression in different cultural settings. In
              addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist, and
              advances our knowledge of this important area of the world.
