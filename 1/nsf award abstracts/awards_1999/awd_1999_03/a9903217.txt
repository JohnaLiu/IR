Fractures are ubiquitous in Earth's crust, and range in
              size from micro-cracks to joints and tectonic faults.  Their tectonic behavior
              under normal and shear loading has fundamental importance in seismology and
              tectonic studies.  The PI proposes a theoretical analysis of slip between two
              rough surfaces that are loaded by normal and shear tractions.  The two bodies
              are treated as elastic half -spaces, and the contact is nominally planar.  The
              topography of the surfaces is Gaussian, simulating the statistical properties
              of samples from the laboratory and the field.  As shear stress is increased,
              slip against Coulomb friction occurs at lightly loaded asperities, gradually
              spreading to contacts under higher normal stress.   The PI has developed theory
              that describes the process mathematically and has applied it to the case where
              the contacts are widely spaced. These preliminary results show good agreement
              with published experimental data.  This work will extend the theory to fualts
              where normal stress is high enough to cause complete contact.
