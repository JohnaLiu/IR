Abstract    :
              This study is intended to develop the ability to predict the burning behavior of
              pulverized coal and biomass. Both the reduction in char reactivity as a result
              of thermal annealing and the mode of char-particle burning are characterized. 
              A char combustion model that predicts particle burning rates and variations in
              size and density of chars is developed.  In the experimental effort, chars are
              injected into a flow reactor in which the gas temperature and oxygen
              concentration are controlled.  Partially reacted char samples are extracted
              from the reactor at various residence times and analyzed.  Properties
              determined include mass loss, particle size distribution, specific surface
              area, apparent and true densities and intrinsic chemical reactivities. 
              Size-classified coal and biomass chars and low-porosity and high-porosity
              synthetic chars are studied.  The model developed combines submodels for mode
              of burning, chemical kinetics, and surface-area evolution; this produces a
              comprehensive, reactivity-based char oxidation model that allows for reductions
              in reactivity in due to thermal annealing and for changes in apparent density
              and particle size.
