The investigators plan to measure and interpret crustal
              deformation in China using GPS data.  They will collaborate with Chinese
              scientists on their project "Crustal Motion Observation Network of China",
              sharing U.S. expertise in network design, data processing, analysis, and
              interpretation.  During the upcoming year the investigators will jointly
              analyze and interpret the Chinese data collected in 1998 and 1999, to assess
              the network monument stability, data quality, and approaches to best analyze
              the data.  Team members will visit the participant institutions in China to
              discuss and coordinate future research efforts to strengthen the Crustal Motion
              Observation Network of China project at both the regional and national levels. 
              At the time of the US-China Geodynamics Workshop to be held later this year,
              the investigators will jointly propose with the Chinese colleagues a fully
              integrated plan for GPS data collection and analysis in China for the next 4
              years.
