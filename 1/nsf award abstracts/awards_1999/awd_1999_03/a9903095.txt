The least understood component of the hydrologic cycle in
              arid environments is ground water recharge, which is controlled by climate,
              soils, and vegetation.  Lysimeter data support the hypothesis that ground water
              recharge in arid regions may be more common than previously thought, but high
              concentration of chloride in the root zone and upward water potential gradients
              lead to the opposite hypothesis that desert vadose zone experience negligible
              recharge.

These two contradictory recharge hypotheses may be conciliated
              with each other by recognizing different recharge mechanisms: (i) diffuse
              recharge; (ii) localized recharge in local depressions; (iii) preferential
              pathway flow.  The general objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis
              that on t he La Mesa and Las Canas surfaces  in New Mexico locations with
              negligible recharge resulting from diffuse recharge mechanisms are intermixed
              with spots that produce considerable recharge caused by localized recharge and
              preferential flow.

The soils on the  La Mesa and La Canas surfaces are
              underlain by an indurated calcic horizon, which is considered impermeable for
              soil water.  However, an important feature of this horizon is the presence of
              pipes, which are filled with permeable soil materials and, thus may act as
              water conduits during periods with sufficient precipitation.  If our research
              hypothesis is correct, low chloride concentrations will be found inside the
              pipes and high ones outside the pipes.  The acceptance or rejection of the
              research hypothesis has important implications for water supply and for waste
              disposal in arid soils that are underlain by indurated calcic horizons.
