Abstract    :
              The work of Steven G. Boxer, Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              of the Chemistry Division. The research (i) will explore electro-optic
              properties of molecular vibrations, (ii) will examine synthetic donor-acceptor
              complexes based on metallocene-substituted polyenes to understand the
              relationships between electro-optic properties and non-linear optical
              parameters, (iii) will study weakly coupled mixed-valence systems to get
              information on electronic couplings, and (iv) will determine excited state
              electron and proton transfer dynamics using higher-order Stark spectroscopy to
              test an in-house developed theory and as a probe of dynamics in the solid
              state.

This project will provide significant fundamental information on the
              dynamics of electron transfer and proton transfer processes that are of
              interest in biologically related systems such as proteins and artificial
              photosynthetic species. The results of the work will also provide means to test
              newly developed theory to understand the relationships between electro-optic
              properties and non-linear optical parameters which will impact on the
              preparation of new electronic materials. Both graduate students and
              post-doctoral associates will gain valuable experience in cutting-edge and
              state-of-the-art research.
