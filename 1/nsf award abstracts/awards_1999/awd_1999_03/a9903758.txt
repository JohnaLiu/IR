Are genetic differences between species qualitatively
              different from differences among individuals within a species?  Many of the
              differences between species are adaptive and reflect the historical action of
              natural selection molding populations to different environments.  However, it
              is not clear that positive selection is the principal factor maintaining
              genetic variation within species.  Intra-species variation may be caused by
              deleterious mutations, genetic changes that reduce the survival or reproductive
              success of the organism.  The proposed research tests several predictions of
              the Deleterious Mutation Model (DMM) by measuring how the genetic composition
              of a population changes as a result of artificial selection.  Selection will be
              imposed on flower size of Mimulus guttatus, a model plant species for genetic
              studies.  A range of analyses applied to the resulting data will provide an
              incisive test of the DMM.

The nature of genetic variation in plant
              reproductive characters is a central concern for both the evolution of natural
              populations and the improvement of agricultural plants.  If genetic variation
              in an agriculturally important trait is caused by deleterious mutations, then
              selection for that trait is likely to have detrimental side effects.  A high
              yielding strain may inevitably be more susceptible to disease or adverse
              conditions.  If genetic variation is not caused by deleterious mutations
              however, selection regimes can be developed that produce high yielding plants
              without negative side effects.
