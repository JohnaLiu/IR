We propose to install 25 broadband seismometers
              between Florida and Edmonton to create (with existing permanent stations) a
              35-station quasi-linear array (Figure 2). Stations, borrowed from the IRIS
              PASSCAL program, would operate for 15 months starting Spring, 2001. Data
              (3-channel, 40 samples per second)would be processed into SEED volumes at
              Washington University using the PASSCAL Database, and made publicly available
              through the IRIS DMC. Data analysis, at Brown and Washington Universities,
              would be primarily aimed at studying several structural aspects of (1) the
              core-mantle boundary (CMB) and D'' beneath the central and circum-Pacific, and
              (2) the upper mantle and crust
beneath North America.
