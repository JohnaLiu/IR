Abstract    :
              This project will explore the utility of Mg/Ca in foraminiferal calcite as a
              tracer of water temperature.  If Mg/Ca has a consistent correlation with water
              temperature and is not subject to complications such as physiologic
              fractionation or post-depositional diagenesis, it can be used in conjunction
              with 18 O/16 O to estimate sea surface temperature and mean ocean composition
              as a function of ice volume, allowing the determination of two important
              variables in the geologic past.  Paired analyses of Mg/Ca and 18 O/16 O will be
              done on various sample sets to test for effects of (1) species-specific
              fractionation, (2) growth-rate, and (3) dissolution.  Studies will incorporate
              analyses in at least two cores from the tropical Pacific over
              glacial/interglacial time scales to test applicaiton of the method.  13 C/12 C
              data generated by the same analyses will be used to evaluate the record of past
              ocean alkalinity and partial pressure of CO 2, using calibrations previously
              established in the laboratory.
