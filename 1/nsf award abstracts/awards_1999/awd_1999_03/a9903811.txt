	Two different kinds of upper Eocene spherules have been
              previously described: 1) microtektites belonging to the North American tektite
              strewn field, and 2) clinopyroxene-bearing  spherules.  The number of Eocene
              spherule layers is in dispute.  The purpose of the proposed research is to
              determine the number of spherule layers and their geographic extent using Ocean
              Drilling Project core samples from 15-20 sites.  We will also look for
              associated impact ejecta.  Biostratigraphic data, petrography and composition
              (major, trace, and isotopic) of the spherules, and the nature of any associated
              ejecta will be used to sort out the number of spherule layers.  Geographic
              variations in spherule abundance and petrographic and compositional data will
              be used to determine the nature of the parent material and the source area
              (and, if possible, the source crater) for each spherule layer.
