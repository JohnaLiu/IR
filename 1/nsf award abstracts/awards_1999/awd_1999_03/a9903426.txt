Abstract    :
              9903426
This proposal seeks funding to create a database on retention and
              graduation rates for minority students in SMETE disciplines.  While the data
              collection efforts will focus on Alliance For Minority institutions, it will
              also try to collect data from other universities and colleges.   Overtime, the
              project seeks to provide an important bseline for observing changes and trends.
                Using the database, the project will develop reports and analyses on the
              linkages between programs and outcomes.
