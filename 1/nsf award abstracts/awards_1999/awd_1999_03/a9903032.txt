Several circum-Atlantic Neoproterozoic terranes, such as
              Avalon, Carolina, and Cadomia, have generally similar characteristics,
              suggesting the possibility that these terranes are directly related.  However,
              many critical aspects of terrane characterization need to be determined before
              hypotheses about possible terrane relationships can be fully evaluated. 
              Aspects of terrane characterization that are crucial to any meaningful
              comparisons include establishing the age and nature of the basement to the
              terrane, determining the timing of initiation of magmatism and subsequent
              magmatic events within the terranes, documenting the geochemical character of
              each magmatic episode, documenting the initiation, duration, and style of
              first-order deformational events, and determining the history of basin
              development and sedimentation.  These aspects of terrane characterization will
              be carried out for two major segments of the Cadomian orogenic belt in the
              North Armorican Massif of France, a region only minimally affected by Variscan
              deformation.  Results are expected to improve understanding of the development
              and dispersion of these neoproterozoic terranes that were once in close
              proximity, but now are widely distributed around the margins of the Atlantic.
