One of the most striking patterns within ecological assemblages
              is the decline in species richness with increasing resource availability. This
              ubiquitous paradox of enrichment has been noted for at least a century but
              remains unexplained. Three prominent hypotheses, spatial resource
              heterogeneity, colonization limitation, and assemblage level thinning offer
              independent explanations to the paradox of enrichment in plant assemblages.
              This research will test these three hypotheses simultaneously using an
              experimental fertility gradient in a perennial dominated old field plant
              assemblage. These three hypotheses comprise three major conceptual themes in
              ecology that have previously been marshaled to explain patterns of diversity
              and coexistence. They are not mutually exclusive, and this research will be
              able to offer an integrated explanation of the paradox of enrichment.
              Currently, the experimental fertility gradient is generating the paradox of
              enrichment, and light quantity and light heterogeneity decline sharply as
              fertility rises. This research is now poised to test the extent to which each
              of these three hypotheses contributes to the paradox of enrichment.
