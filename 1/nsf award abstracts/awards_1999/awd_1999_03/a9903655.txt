Abstract    :
                   This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project aims to make
              adjustments in the molecular structure of the chiral solute to make it suitable
              for application in Bragg reflective chiral nematic high resolution displays. 
              This requires a molecular design which will maintain the same nanostructure
              dimensions over the temperature range of the nematic phase.  Helical
              nanostructures are created when a chiral solvent is added to a nematic liquid
              crystal.  This proposal takes advantage of the recent discovery of a new class
              of soluble chiral molecules which possess ultra-high helical twisting powers
              (HTPs).  Only 3 wt. percent  of the material in a nematic host is required to
              create a dielectric layered stack to Bragg reflect visible light. 
      The
              technical breakthrough of this work is to develop greatly improved reflective
              display materials.  The high HTP materials will provide: significantly lower
              voltage, faster switching characteristics, improved electro-optic response,
              brighter and higher contrast displays, and will avoid foreign owned patents
              which prohibit US manufactures from incorporating multiple chiral materials
              currently necessary for making chiral nematic reflective displays.
