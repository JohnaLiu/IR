Avian predators are thought to constrain dispersal across
              Heliconius hybrid zones by killing rare morphs at disproportionately high
              rates, yet the mechanisms of predatory behavior leading to this
              frequency-dependent selection are unknown. In particular, experimental
              investigations of specialized predators like jacamars are needed. This
              dissertation research will address three related objectives: (1) to quantify
              learning and forgetting rates in jacamars, (2) to design and test rapid
              assessment surveys measuring the density of jacamars and Heliconius, and (3) to
              compare attach rates and predator-prey densities in a narrow and wide region of
              a Heliconius hybrid zone. For objectives 1 and 2, a combination of cage and
              field experiments will be employed in Venezuela. For objective 3, two
              transects, one wide and one narrow, will be studies in a variable hybrid zone
              in Bolivia by setting up seven experimental plots along each transect and
              comparing attack rates and densities of jacamars and Heliconius. An
              investigation of jacamar predation in Heliconius hybrid zones will enrich all
              mimicry studies by testing a crucial component of mimicry models, by expanding
              our knowledge of how specialized predators learn and forget mimetic prey, and
              by exploring the foraging behavior of a distinct family of neotropical birds.
