Olduvai Gorge incises the Serengeti Plain of northern
              Tanzania and exposes a 25 kilometer-long window into the Plio-Pleistocene
              continental record of east Africa.  The exposed continuous two million year
              paleoenvironmental history contains an extensive vertebrate record (including
              hominids) and a rich cultural record of central importance in the study of
              human evolution. Important correlation problems discovered during recent work
              in the Gorge can be resolved by using field stratigraphic measurements combined
              with geochemical "fingerprinting" of tuffs to constrain radiometric and
              paleomagnetic 
dating. The product of a single volcanic eruption, in theory,
              has unique chemical characteristics and provides an isochronous marker. Each
              tuff can be "geochemically fingerprinted" using mineralogy, and major, minor,
              and trace element abundances data for individual glass shards and then
              40Ar/39Ar dated using potassium-rich individual feldspar crystals. The
              paleomagnetic record will provide an independent verification of our
              correlations. The combined data set will provide the crucial chronological
              framework for interpreting the local record and correlating with global
              environmental, paleoanthropolgical and paleomagnetic records.
