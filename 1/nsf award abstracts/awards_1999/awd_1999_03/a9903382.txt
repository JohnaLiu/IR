The mass extinction at the end of the 250 million-year-old
              Permian Period was the most consequential in Earth history, causing an
              estimated 80-90% of all species then living on Earth to die out.  To date, no
              accepted mechanism has been discovered.  This research will explore the tempo
              and pattern of extinction among land life at the end of the Permian by
              collecting large numbers of vertebrate fossils from the Karoo Basin of South
              Africa, and tying their occurrence to measured stratigraphic sections.  The
              time frame of their disappearance will be calibrated using magnetostratigraphy.
               The resulting data should show whether the extinction was rapid or slow in
              non-marine environments, and thus provide clues to causation.  It should also
              show whether the extinctions on land were synchronous with those in the sea.
