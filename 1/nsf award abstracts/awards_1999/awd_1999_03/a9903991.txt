Spectroscopically accurate potential energy functions
              for proteins are necessary for providing reliable normal mode analyses as well
              as quantitative structural and dynamics simulations of these macromolecules.
              Such a spectroscopically determined force field (SDFF) will be developed for
              the polypeptide chain. This will be based on the same protocol used in this
              laboratory to produce SDFFs for saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon chains. A
              preliminary SDFF for a non-hydrogen-bonded polypeptide chain has been obtained
              from scaled ab initio calculations of glycine and alanine dipeptides, and this
              SDFF will be fully optimized. The present preliminary development of a
              spectroscopically sound electrostatic model for the hydrogen bond will be
              completed. These two functions will then be combined to produce an SDFF for the
              hydrogen-bonded polypeptide chain.  Similar calculations will provide
              parameters for all protein side chains. This force field will be used in
              structural and dynamics studies of peptide and protein systems.

Interactions
              between biomolecules can be accurately modeled in computer simulations only if
              the dynamic properties of the molecules, not just their static structures, are
              properly accounted for. This means that the energy functions describing the
              dynamics of the molecules, in significant part represented by their
              spectroscopic properties, must be comparably accurate. Present energy functions
              do not sufficiently satisfy this criterion. This research program will produce
              such accurate functions for proteins, making possible much more reliable
              predictions of their biological properties. This project is supported by the
              Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular
              Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Divisions of
              Physics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and
              Physical Sciences Directorate.
