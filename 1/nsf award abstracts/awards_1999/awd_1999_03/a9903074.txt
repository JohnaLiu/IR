The Blake Event is a short-duration reversed interval
              in the Brunhes Chron.  It is thought to have occurred about 125,000 years B.P,
              although its age is poorly constrained.  It possibly included multiple
              reversals (up to three reversed intervals have been reported).  The PI intends
              to obtain up to seven parallel records from Chinese loesses and paleosols near
              Lanzhou, where the Blake Event has previously been observed in a few places. 
              The goals are (1) to constrain the beginning and end dates of the Event, (2) to
              verify whether the Event consists of multiple reversals or not, and (3) to
              determine whether some of the loess-paleosol sequences acquired their remanent
              magnetizations with a significant delay.  This delay time, in turn, is critical
              to correct inferred ages for older reversal boundaries in the loess, such as
              the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary.   A mismatch exists in the literature between
              the paleoclimatic stage in which this reversal is recorded in the Chinese loess
              (a cold interval) and that recorded in deep-marine sequences (a warm interval).
               Once delay times (if any) have been quantified, the PI will attempt to
              correlate these factors with environmental parameters, such as precipitation,
              sedimentation rates, or degree of pedogenesis, as revealed through rock
              magnetic studies of the magnetic minerals.  This correlation is important to
              assess the use of magnetic parameters as paleoclimatic proxies, particularly
              for the evolution of Asian and Indian monsoonal patterns.
