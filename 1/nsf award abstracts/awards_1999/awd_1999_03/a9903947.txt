This project proposes to develop a mechanistic and
              spatially explicit model describing the growth, structure and species
              composition of forests in the Rocky Mountains. The framework for the conceptual
              model and the specific hypothesis is built on the extensive theoretical and
              empirical research on water relations and carbon allocation. This new model,
              the Leaf Area Allocation Simulation (LAASIM) will be an individual tree-based
              simulation model that is physiologically-mechanistic in a way that is sensitive
              to climate and environmental variability that is based upon fundamental
              research in woody plant biology. This information gained from this research
              will highlight our understanding of the interaction of environmental
              variability and basic organism- and community-level biological and ecological
              mechanisms, and test a number of hypotheses concerning these mechanisms.
