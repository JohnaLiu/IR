The PI proposes to conduct a systematic investigation of
              thermal convection in a compressible fluid with non-Newtonian temperature and
              depth-dependent rheology and phase transformations in a series of 2-D
              calculations designed to study subduction at Rayleigh numbers appropriate for
              Earth's mantle.  The goal of this research is to map out the relationship
              between the initial conditions, boundary conditions, equation of state,
              properties of the major phase transformations, and rheology laws on the
              observables (e.g., slab thermal structure, geoid anomaly, topographic anomaly,
              plate velocity, and plateness' of the surface velocities).  The final result
              will be a seires of 2-D and 3-D phase diagrams relating the variation in one or
              two of the fluid dynamical input parameters with observables features of
              specific subduction zones.
