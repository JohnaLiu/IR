Ongoing studies of the "Deep Probe" teleseismic transects,
              which cross a major Archean-Proterozoic suture in Wyoming and Colorado, pose
              questions that analysis of the co-located Lodore broadband data can address. 
              the very dense teleisemic sampling provided by this array - one year of
              recording from 33 stations distributed in a 2-D griad at 5-10 km station
              spacing - will allow detailed imaging of crusta and mantle structure.  We
              propose to use 3-dimensional Kirchoff migration to:  1) depth migrate Pms and
              Ppms Moho arrivals and other potential discontinuities observed in the upper
              100 km; 2) migrate the P-wave coda to search for coherent near-surface
              scattering due to topography and sedimentary basins; 3) image the
              amplitude/sharpeness/scattering characteristics of the 410 and 660 km
              discontinuities.  Integration of this proposed research with our Deep Probe
              results will allow us to better define what processes are currently reworking
              this circum-cratonic region, and if the Archean and Proterozoic lithosphere are
              responding differently to the reworking event.
