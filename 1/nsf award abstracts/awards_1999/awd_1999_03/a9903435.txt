Abstract    :
              This project investigates the evolution of primate teeth using a novel
              integration of paleontology and genetics.  Dental traits (characteristics) will
              be measured for 300 animals from a colony of 3,000 baboons housed at the
              Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio, Texas.  We will
              investigate dental traits known from the fossil record of baboons as well as
              new ones identified through the study of tooth development.  Family trees are
              kept for the Southwest Foundation baboons, so that we know each individual's
              mother, father, siblings, etc. 

Inheritance patterns of the dental traits
              will be determined using the pedigree data and probability tests.  This
              analysis will identify traits that are linked to others and those that have a
              strong genetic signal.  Traits that appear to follow a clear genetic
              inheritance pattern will then be tested, again using probability theory, to
              determine if particular ones correlate with particular regions of the genome. 
              This is possible, since genome maps have been made for 700 of the animals. 
              Using this method, we may be able to pinpoint regions of the genome that
              contain genes involved in tooth development.  This is the first project to
              attempt to identify genes acting on tooth development using information from
              teeth themselves.  Results from this study will give us a better understanding
              of the genetic mechanisms underlying traits seen in the fossil record and may
              ultimately lead to the identification of genes that play a large role in tooth
              development in humans as well as non-human primates.
