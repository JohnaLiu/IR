This project is supported under the initiative on
              "Research Centers - Small Firms Collaborative R&D."  The study concerns joint
              research between the Imaging Systems Laboratory (ISL) of the ERC for
              Optoelectronic Computing Systems and CDM Optics, Inc., Boulder, CO, which plans
              to apply the results to the problem of optical inspection. 
CDM Optics will
              develop signal processing hardware to do the processing at video rates, and do
              any modifications to the signal processing algorithms, supplied by the ISL,
              that may be required to put them into an integrated circuit chip.  The final
              tests of the complete system will be done in the ISL, with interaction with CDM
              Optics.  Simulations can be done with the optics and the signal processing of
              the system together so that the signal processing algorithms can be refined,
              and any modifications made to the optical system.  During this work, tolerances
              on the optical elements will be determined.  The signal processing algorithm
              will be put on a processing chip so that preliminary experiments can be
              started.  The final experimental system will be assembled in the ISL and the
              experiments completed at CDM Optics.  If the project is successful, then CDM
              Optics can commercialize the technology in applications that require video-rate
              images, starting with industrial inspection and the positioning of small
              parts.
