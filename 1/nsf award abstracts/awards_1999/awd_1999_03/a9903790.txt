Abstract    :
              	Nitrous oxide (N2O) plays a significant role in terms of controlling
              stratospheric ozone and is an important greenhouse gas.  N2O is increasing in
              the atmosphere and has been targeted for regulation under the Montreal
              Protocol.  Previous stable isotopic measurements of stratospheric N2O have
              demonstrated highly enriched 15/14N and 18/16O ratios.  It has been proposed
              that this fractionation is caused by variations in the photolysis rate of
              various isotopomers.  This project involves the laboratory investigation of the
              isotopic fractionation of N2O by ultraviolet photolysis in the wavelength range
              198-220 nm.  The ultraviolet absorption cross sections of various nitrous oxide
              isotopomers will be measured at high spectral resolution. Photolysis
              experiments will also be carried out with mass spectrometric and near-infrared
              Fourier transform spectroscopy to examine the isotopic fractionation of
              residual N2O. The results of these experiments will be used to refine the
              interpretation of atmospheric nitrous oxide isotopic ratio measurements and
              improve our understanding of the contribution of various sources and sinks to
              the global atmospheric nitrous oxide budget.
