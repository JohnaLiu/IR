Events in the geologic record responsible for the
              gradual increase in the 187Os/188Os and 87Sr/86Sr values for seawater through
              the Tertiary are poorly understood. The rapid growth of radiogenic Os, compared
              to other isotopic systems, within the crust, offers a new tool, which may help
              further constrain the large-scale tectonic history of the Himalayan orogen. We
              will address variations in the Os and Sr and isotopic composition of paleo-
              Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers over the last 50 myrs. Our goal is to
              determine if the Os isotopic composition of paleosols can be related to changes
              in ocean chemistry and related to the source and timing of foreland basin
              sediments of major tectonostratigraphic zones of the western and central
              Nepal.
