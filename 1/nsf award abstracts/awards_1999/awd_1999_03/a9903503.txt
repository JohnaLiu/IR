Title: Dynamics
              of Atmospheric Response to Midlatitude SST Anomalies

The collaborative
              research (Peng/Univ. Co Boulder and Robinson/Univ. Ill Urbana Champaign) will
              develop a better understanding of the dynamics involved in generating an
              equivalent-barotropic ridge response to midlatitude SST anomalies.  The impact
              of the response on midlatitude atmosphere-ocean interactions will also be
              examined. There are three components to this project   (a) idealized model
              experiments; (b) GCM experiments and (c) mechanistic diagnoses. The idealized
              models will be used to find optimal locations in the Pacific and the Atlantic
              for warm SSTs to trigger the strongest positive eddy feedback favorable for
              robust ridge responses. The PIs will test predictions from the idealized model
              experiments using the GCM. The work is important because it will increase
              understanding of the role of midlatitude SSTs in climate variability.
