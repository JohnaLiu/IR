The project will investigate the interplay between mineral
              chemistry, microbial ecology, and mineral weathering in shallow ground waters,
              focusing on the nutrient potential of feldspars in nutrient limited ground
              waters.  The project will examine the influence of mineral composition on
              microbial growth, and the resultant influence of microbial colonization on
              mineral weathering rate and nutrient release, using both laboratory and field
              methods.  Specific research objectives for the proposed project are to 1)
              examine the in situ colonization behavior of native organisms on silicates,
              surface-altered silicates, and basalts as a function of mineral surface
              characteristics and nutrient content; 2) characterize the influence of feldspar
              and glass-bound P, N, and Fe on microbial growth and the rate of substrate
              utilization, 3)(characterize the rate of mineral dissolution and nutrient
              release as a function of microbial population (type and density) and nutrient
              limitation and 4) compare the bioavailability of P present as apatite and
              apatite inclusions to P present in a glass matrix.  The field sites are a
              nutrient-limited petroleum contaminated aquifer, a methanogenic wetland, and a
              lignitic sandstone aquifer.  Laboratory microcosms will use aquifer sediments
              amended with glass or mineral phases as the sole source of inorganic nutrients,
              and changes in community structure, rate of substrate removal, biomass
              production, and mineral weathering characterized.  The results of this project
              will provide insight on the influence of mineral composition on microbial
              colonization, community structure, and survival in the subsurface, and the role
              of microorganisms in the early and rapid weathering of specific minerals of
              biologic value.
