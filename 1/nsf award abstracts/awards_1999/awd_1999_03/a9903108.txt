The objective of this research is to characterize the
              structure and composition of silver-gold alloy surfaces.  Using single crystal
              samples, the atomic positions and elemental compositions of the first few
              atomic layers are measured.  The main characterization method employed is low
              energy electron diffraction.  The energy of the incident beam is varied and the
              diffracted beam intensities measured using video imaging and digitization
              technology.  The desired information is extracted from the data since the
              structure and composition of the surface determine the variation of the
              scattered intensity with energy.  All experiments are performed on clean,
              annealed surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum.  Experiments are performed on the three
              major low-index faces of the silver-gold alloy crystal.  In this way, the
              influence of the bulk termination on the composition and structure of the
              surface can be explored.  The surface composition is not expected to be the
              same as the bulk composition due to surface segregation; the influence of the
              metal vacuum interface will alter the composition in the near-surface region. 
              Likewise, the surface structure is not the same as the simple bulk termination.
               Silver-gold alloys are particularly interesting in this respect since the pure
              gold surface is more prone to reconstruction than the pure silver surface. 
              Both of these phenomena (surface structure changes and surface composition
              changes) are greatly affected by the particular crystal face that is exposed. 
              In this work, the (100), (111), and (110) crystal faces are
              investigated.

The significance of this work is based on the contribution
              it will make to overall understanding of the properties of alloy surfaces.  The
              silver-gold system is chosen for its relative simplicity; complicated chemical
              interactions are not expected since these elements are noble metals and the
              lattice constants of the two metals are similar.  The similarity of the lattice
              constants implies that lattice strain effects are minimal.  These
              characteristics make silver-gold alloys a good model system on which to build a
              fundamental understanding of alloy surfaces.
