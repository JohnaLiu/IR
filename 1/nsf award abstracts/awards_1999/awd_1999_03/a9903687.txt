In 1999 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will operate the
              Deep Submergence Vessel ALVIN and the Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) as a
              National Facility.  The ALVIN is supported by the research vessel ATLANTIS. 
              These Vehicles have been operated effectively and safely by the institute for a
              wide variety of NSF sponsored research projects.  Through a Memorandum of
              Agreement between ONR, NOAA and NSF the submersible and ROVs (JASON, MEDIA,
              ARGO and DSL120) support projects funded by the three agencies.

The 1999
              schedule for ALVIN is very heavy at approximately 300 dives.  The use of the
              ROV is Lighter than usual with only 4 cruises.  The facilities are scheduled
              for a total of 408 days of which 302 are NSF, 67 are NOAA, 22 Navy and 17
              private.  All cruises will take place in the Pacific from 13 degrees south to
              the Gulf of Alaska in the Northern Pacific.
