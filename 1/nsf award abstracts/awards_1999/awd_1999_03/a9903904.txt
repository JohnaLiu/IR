Understanding the relationships between species
              diversity and productivity is fundamental to the management and preservation of
              biodiversity.  Despite years of study and intense theoretical interest however,
              the overall relationship remains poorly understood.  This project will examine
              this relationship experimentally in a field project that will manipulate soil
              resource heterogeneity and examine the effect on species diversity.  Diversity
              will also be manipulated by a seed addition treatment.  These experiments will
              examine how resource heterogeneity can influence changes in species diversity
              that parallel similar patterns in overall productivity.  It will provide a test
              of one of the basic hypotheses explaining productivity-diversity
              relationships.
