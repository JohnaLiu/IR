We will participate in an international collaborative
              investigation of the timing, genesis and evolution of the North Atlantic
              Igneous Province (NAIP), a classic volcanic rifted margin. It has been proposed
              that this large igneous province was constructed at the initiation of Iceland
              mantle plume activity, remnants of which include the West and East Greenland
              margin basalts, the Faeroe Islands, the British Tertiary Province, and
              extensive sequences of lava flows and sills that form most of the continental
              margins of the North Atlantic (seaward-dipping reflectors). We will contribute
              radiometric age determinations by the 40Ar-39Ar incremental heating method, for
              whole rock and mineral separates to define the timing and duration of
              volcanism, and in support of correlating volcanic stratigraphy across the
              province.  Precise age determinations are required to establish the timeframe
              of widely separated volcanic and intrusive remnants, determine magma production
              rates through the volcanic history, describe the sequence and duration of
              magmatic phases in different tectonic settings, and correlate peak volcanic
              phases with the sedimentary record of environmental response to this large
              igneous province. The first order goal of the program is to use the record of
              magmatism and tectonism throughout the province to assess "active" (plume head)
              vs "passive" (plume incubation) models of continental rifting in the presence
              of a mantle plume.
