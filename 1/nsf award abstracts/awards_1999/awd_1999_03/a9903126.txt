Abstract    :
              Gosse

This is a three-year collaborative research project involving Eric
              McDonald and Steve Wells at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nevada; John
              Gosse at the University of Kansas Department of Geology, and analytical work at
              PRIME Lab, Purdue University.

The objectives of this project are to (1)
              develop a strategy to date alluvial sediments that considers and minimizes the
              effects of inheritance and other geological factors such as turbation, which
              are significant controls on the terrestrial exposure dating methods such as
              10Be and 26 Al.  (2) Characterize the soils and stratigraphy in the fans along
              the Providence Mountains, eastern California, collect surface and subsurface
              samples to establish the exposure age of the alluvial fans, and develop a
              regional chronostratigraphy, and use this to interpret climatic and tectonic
              records for southeastern California and southwestern Nevada.
