The National Research Council's report, Ecologically based pest
              management (EBPM), recommended future pest management strategies be built upon
              ecological processes with saafe, profitable, and sustainable outcomes.
              Interdisciplinary actions are needed to promote research and adoption of
              ecological approaches to pest management. The National Research Council
              proposes a national forum be organized to bring together professional societies
              and other potential collaborators involved in aspects of ecological pest
              management in agriculture. The forum objective is to enhance communication
              among scientists, practitioners, and policy makers that do not normally get to
              interact to further research and implementation of ecologically-based pest
              management strategies. A proceedings will be prepared that describes the issues
              and opportunities raised in the workshop.
