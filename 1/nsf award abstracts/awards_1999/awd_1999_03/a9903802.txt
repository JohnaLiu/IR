Plants with separate genders have evolved repeatedly from
              plants with combined genders (hermaphrodites), leading some evolutionary
              biologists to conclude that this evolutionary transition represents a central
              problem in biology. This work aims to dissect the causes of natural selection
              for separate sexes, in particular selection on male function of hermaphrodites,
              and on attractive floral features, by directly investigating the strength of
              natural selection under contrasting ecological environments.  This work will
              combine paternity analyses using microsatellite DNA markers with quantitative
              genetic-based theory to address long-standing questions regarding the
              mechanisms of natural selection for separation of the sexes and sexual
              dimorphism.

This  research will contribute to our understanding the role of
              the environment in shaping plant reproductive phenotype. The results of this
              research will also have important implications for agricultural practices that
              aim to increase yield in, and conservation biology of, endangered  plants with
              separate genders.
