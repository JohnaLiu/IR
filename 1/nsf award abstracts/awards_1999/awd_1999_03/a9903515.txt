Abstract    :
              The investigators will establish a network for continuous observation and
              surveillance of processes in the solar atmosphere. The main effort is to
              install and operate three large digital cameras to obtain full disk images of
              the sun in the red light emitted by hydrogen (H-alpha) in the lower
              chromosphere, approximately 1000-km above the surface. The data will be used to
              track every new emergence of magnetic flux in order to understand why some new
              flux forms super-active regions while other emerging flux decays quickly. Other
              activities include providing high quality data for solar activity monitoring
              and for correlative studies with other ground-bases and spacecraft
              observations. All flares and filament or prominence eruptions observed by the
              network will be classified and cataloged.
