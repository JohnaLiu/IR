Tallgrass prairie on fertile, well-watered soils represents
              North America's most endangered major ecosystem with much of it converted to
              agriculture. This study proposes to continue an experiment testing for the
              effects of birds, mammals and planting density on the succession and community
              composition of synthetic tallgrass communities. In this expanded study,
              experiments are planned that will test for indirect effects of the small
              vertebrates through competition and facilitation among plant species. Since
              early results demonstrated that the voles had dramatic impacts on the legume
              species, it is predicted that some interactions among plants may be mediated
              through soil nitrogen. This will be tested using path analysis to test for
              ongoing effects of herbivory and granivory and to test apart causes and
              consequences of plant-plant interactions that is being driven by the
              vertebrates. It is hoped that managers, conservationists and restorationists in
              management of the surviving tallgrass prairie remnants will use information
              garnered from this experiment.
