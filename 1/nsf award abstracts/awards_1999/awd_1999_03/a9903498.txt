The New York Hall of Science is in the process of designing
              and constructing a 50,000 sq. ft. facility addition. This project, which could
              also be called project BUILD:  Building Underway-Informal Learning Design, will
              take advantage of the inherent teaching and learning opportunities in science
              and engineering found in an authentic, real-time setting.  A portable exhibit
              unit, fashioned after a construction-site fence with peepholes, will highlight
              aspects of technology, math, engineering, and materials sciences found in the
              building trades and architecture.  Each peephole will display an artifact,
              text, image or interactive for the visitor and have specific learning outcomes
              defined during the development of the exhibit.

Associated programing, in the
              form of Explainer demostrations, workshops, lectures, building trades career
              days, design, and hard hat tours will be created for three distinct audiences
              -- families, adolescents 11-14 (middle-school) and young adults 15-18 (high
              school).  The exhibit and programs will evolve and amend themselves in tandem
              with the changeable timetables and nature of construction.  Finally, a
              guidebook written on "how to" replicate these learning experiences, construct
              the exhibit fence for other venues, and partner with architects and
              tradespeople will be available to the wider museum and informal learning
              community.
