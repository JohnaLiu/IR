Youngbluth
This award supports Marsh Youngbluth from the Harbor Branch
              Oceanographic Institution in a collaboration with Ulf Balmstedt of the
              Department of Fisheries and Marine Biology at the University of Bergen, Norway.
               The research will focus on predicting predation by the jellyfish Periphylla
              periphylla, which acts as a regulatory species in pelagic food webs of
              Norwegian fjords.  The cooperative study will elucidate relationships between
              foraging strategies and water column variables.  Such comparisons will make
              estimations of feeding impact possible which will contribute significantly to
              models of predatory dynamics.  The international partnership will strengthen
              the domestic research program by providing new insights about temporal,
              spatial, and behavioral variables that act to influence the distribution,
              abundance and feeding habits of a tentaculate predator.
