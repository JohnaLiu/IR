Support is requested for a four-day workshop on articulating
              research goals in geobiology for the next decade.  The conference, to be held
              at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. March 6-9, 1999, will
              formulate and justify promising scientific objectives in areas such as the
              understanding the response of the Earth's biosphere to environmental
              perturbation and understanding how critical variables have affected the
              evolution of life and the Earth's surface.  The workshop will also focus on
              database initiatives that will affect the infrastructure of the discipline as
              well as create new research modalities.  Initiatives in education and outreach
              will also be established.  Technological innovation and multi-disciplinary
              approaches to important scientific issues call for new approaches to educating
              geobiologists in the next decade.  The extensive public and student interest in
              paleontology makes the discipline an ideal vehicle for education about life in
              the Earth's environment.
