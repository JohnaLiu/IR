Abstract    :
                    This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project aims to 
              develop two spray (flame and cold spray) processes to produce nanostructured
              coatings. In flame spraying, the proposers will use liquid feedstock to produce
              powdery deposits and convert them to dense coatings by heat treatment. Spray
              synthesized powders will be micro consolidated and used as solid feedstock in
              cold spray process to produce in situ nano coatings.  In Phase I, studies for
              understanding the formation and grain growth in nanostructured coatings will be
              carried out.  In Phase II, the proposers will use this knowledge to design and
              develop nanocomposite coatings that exhibit grain growth resistance, and test
              them in actual application environments.  Thermally sprayed protective coatings
              are widely used in many industries for protection of the system components.
              Nanostructured coatings, with their superior properties, can lead to quantum
              jump in the life and performances of these components.  Recent attempts to
              produce nanocoatings by spray processes showed that grain coarsening occurs
              during the coating production. Since nanocomposites can exhibit grain growth
              resistance, study of the nanocomposite coatings can lead to preparation of
              nanocoatings with desired characteristics.

     Successful completion of
              this program will lead to commercial application of nanostructured coatings in
              many industries, inducing investments during Phase-III.
