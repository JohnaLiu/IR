The proposed research is an experimental investigation at
              high pressure and temperature of potassium- and
fluorine-rich minerals/phases
              that may be stable in variably hydrous environments of Earth's upper mantle. 
              The study will start with a pair of compounds that have been demonstrated to be
              stable at such Earth conditions but are otherwise inadequately understood;
              these phases include K-cymrite (KAlSi3O8onH2O), the hydrous analog of
              K-feldspar, and KMgF3, a perovskite-structure phase used as an analog for
              silicate perovskites.  The research will 1) determine the upper range of
              pressure and temperature stability of these phases in mineral(fluid assemblages
              appropriate to known mantle rocks and to crustal rocks that are candidates for
              subduction into the mantle, 2) characterize the phases with respect to
              composition, OH content, and structural state, and 3) determine the inter-phase
              partitioning of constituent elements.  Other phases to be included in
              experiments will be fluorphlogopite, phengitic mica, fluor-K-richterite, and
              K-feldspar, and results from this study knowledge will improve the knowledge of
              their stability conditions as well.  Experiments will be carried out in
              Walker-type multianvil apparati, and products will be analyzed by a combination
              of electron microprobe, scanning-electron microscopic and cathodoluminescence
              imaging, x-ray diffraction, and FT-IR spectroscopy.  Results from the research
              will be used to improve predictions of the storage of potassium and fluorine in
              reservoirs in the mantle as compared to the elements' partitioning into fluids
              and melts.
