Dynamo modeling has advanced to the stage that meaningful
              comparisons between simulated behavior of the geomagnetic field and
              observational data can now be made. The Glatzmaier-Roberts 3-D, dynamically
              self-consistent supercomputer computations employ both thermal and
              compositional convection in the core driven by various prescribed patterns of
              heat flux at the core-mantle boundary. They have now yielded simulations of the
              geomagnetic field totaling about one and a half million model years that
              exhibit dipole-dominated, stable polarity intervals punctuated by excursions
              and reversals. The investigators propose to analyze these geodynamo simulations
              in order to compare them with paleomagnetically observed field behavior, both
              time-averaged field data and records of directional excursions and polarity
              reversals. These comparisons will lead both to improved dynamo models and to a
              better understanding of processes and conditions in the core and deep mantle
              that are important in generating the Earth's field.
