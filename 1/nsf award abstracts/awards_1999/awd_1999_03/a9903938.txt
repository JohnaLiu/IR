Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop analytical tools that could be
              applied to genomic sequence information in order to predict the complete
              phenotype of an organism.  This research is a combined effort between Dr.
              Palsson at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), NSF award 9814092,
              and Dr. Church at Harvard University (HU).  The research will involve a dynamic
              interaction between algorithm development and mathematical representations of
              phenotypes (in silico analysis) and experimentally determined patterns of gene
              expression and growth.  The in silico work will be performed at UCSD and the
              experimental work will be performed at HU.  The three specific goals outlined
              are:  (1) to develop algorithms that can use bioinformatic data based to
              identify genes and their functions, predict the metabolic biochemistry a cell
              can perform, and represent the physiological behavior of a given strain bases
              on its metabolism, (2) to develop algorithms that will predict the impact of
              altering the genotype on growth, metabolic flux and pathway utilization, and
              predict changes in genome-wide patterns of gene expression as a function of
              changes in growth conditions, and (3) to develop experimental approaches using
              E. coli K-12 to directly test the predictions made by in silico analysis. The
              approaches will involve the use of DNA chip technology to monitor genome-wide
              changes in gene expression in wild type cells under well-defined environment
              conditions and the rigorous construction of isogenic strains whose metabolic
              activities can be experimentally determined and compared to the predictions
              generated by the in silico analysis. This award is part of the Interagency
              Activity in Metabolic Engineering (NSF 98-49).
