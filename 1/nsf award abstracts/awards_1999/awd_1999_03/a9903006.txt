The Pennsylvanian of the Western Great Basin is generally
              thought to be a time of relative tectonic quiescence between the Devonian
              Antler and the Permo-Triassic Sonoma Orogenies.  However, recent evidence for
              tight folding and thrusting to middle Pennsylvanian age in several mountain
              ranges of North - Central Nevada has cast doubt on this interpretation.  This
              project will attempt to determine the extent of this deformation and to
              evaluate several of the existing models for this time period in the light of
              these new data.  Results are expected to increase knowledge of the number of
              tectonic pulses and their timing during the late Paleozoic of the Western
              United States.
