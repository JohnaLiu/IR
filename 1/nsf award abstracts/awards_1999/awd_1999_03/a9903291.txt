Ilopango caldera in central El Salvador erupted violently to
              produce widespread ashfalls and hot ash flows at least four times in the last
              60,000 years, and most recently in AD 260.  Ilopango is perhaps the most
              dangerous volcanic center in Central America because of its potential for
              violent explosive eruption and its proximity to San Salvador, the largest city
              in Central America.  In AD 260, hot ash flows spread throughout the Salvadoran
              highlands and swept up to 40 km down steep valleys onto the Pacific coastal
              plain, areas then populated by early Mayan civilization and now densely
              populated.  Ash fell across much of Central America, much of southern Mexico,
              and nearby parts of the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico.  The eruption may
              well have been the greatest catastrophe ever to befall Meso-American
              civilization.  The eruptives have total volume of 20 to 50 cubic km and
              encompass 6 stages:  (1) initial fall and surges, (2) main Plinian fall, (3)
              energetic pyroclastic deposit, (4) phreatoplinian fall, (5) bedded
              phreatomagmatic fall, and (6) main ignimbrite.  This study will characterize
              controls on eruption style and intensity and differentiate factors intrinsic
              and extrinsic to the magma.  Study of the complex but distinctive stratigraphy
              of deposits will address the following important topics in volcanology:  field
              calibration of numerical models for Plinian eruptions, transport and deposition
              mechanisms for pyroclastic flows and surges, and magma-water interactions in
              explosive eruptions through shallow water.  The chief goal of the study is a
              better understanding of the behavior of explosive eruptions through shallow
              water and, specifically, that of Ilopango caldera during eruptive cycles.  An
              important secondary goal is increasing awareness of volcanic processes and
              their affiliated hazards in El Salvador.
