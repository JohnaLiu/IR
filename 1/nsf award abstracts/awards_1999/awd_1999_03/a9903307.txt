The transition in deformation mechanism from brittle fracture
              to plastic flow is important in understanding tectonophysics, the strength of
              the crust, and the style of deformation at the field scale, but as yet, there
              are only a few suggestions for constitutive laws for semi-brittle deformation. 
              Using a new deformation apparatus, the investigators are measuring permeability
              and storage capacity during deformation in rocks composed dominantly of either
              calcite or olivine. The proposed work extends initial studies to a range of
              temperature, pressure and effective pressures spanning the transition from
              brittle to plastic flow in both rock types. In situ measurements of dilatancy
              are an important part of the macroscopic description of the deformation mode,
              and the experiments will concentrate on making axial and volumetric strain
              measurements during the mechanical tests. The macroscopic measurements will be
              accompanied with detailed, quantitative observations of the microstructure,
              including crack surface area per unit volume, crack length, crack number
              density, dislocation density, dislocation orientation, and crack-dislocation
              interactions.
