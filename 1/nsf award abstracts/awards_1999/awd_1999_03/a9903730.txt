Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to
              produce a sensor technology which offers excellent sensing properties while
              withstanding high temperatures, pressures and electromagnetic fields, corrosive
              chemicals and radioactive contamination. A surface acoustic wave (SAW)
              structure employing an epitaxially grown aluminum nitride film and an aluminum
              oxide passivation layer on a sapphire substrate is being proposed as a sensor
              technology to meet this need.  The Phase I effort will focus on the deposition
              of aluminum nitride piezoelectric and aluminum oxide passivation layers, the
              design of the layered SAW structure, the electrical characterization and the
              evaluation of the structure as a sensing element. The structure will be
              evaluated relative to its ability to survive harsh physical, chemical and
              electromagnetic environments, including temperatures in excess of 1000  C,
              CF4/02 plasma irradiated by 600 Watts of 13 MHz RF power and strong magnetic
              and electric fields. Phase I will result in materials and device technology in
              support of the overall objectives.  Phase II effort will explore suitable
              instrumentation for minimal contact and non-contact moni-toring of the SAW
              sensor. Specific sensing applications will be explored. Building on the Phase I
              results, Phase II will result in a prototype sensor system for Phase III
              commercialization.  
The applications that are expected are in
              industrial/chemical process monitoring, electric power distribution system
              monitoring, chemical sensing in mixed waste.
