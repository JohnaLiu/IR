Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to
              prove the feasibility of developing a solid electrolyte NOX, sensor with a
              fixed reference and a metal oxide covered sensing electrode for harsh
              environments. Specifically, the approach will be to use YSZ as solid
              electrolyte, a coating of microporous zeolite material as fixed reference
              electrode and metal oxide as auxiliary phase to function as a sensing
              electrode.  There is a continuing need for the development of rugged and
              reliable sensors capable of making measurements in the harsh environments.  The
              use of sensors results in many benefits, including improved energy efficiency,
              better quality, lower scrap rate, and reduced emissions.  The automotive
              industry is also challenged to further reduce exhaust emissions from mobile
              sources. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments will also require many power and
              utility industries to monitor emissions. Emission monitoring sensors include
              those for CO, NOX, 02, and  hydrocarbons.  Major advances in these sensors are
              required in terms of lower cost, selectivity, durability and reliability.  
  
                   Successful development of the proposed sensor for harsh environments will
              provide opportunities to increase productivity, decrease scraps, and attain EPA
              clean air standards in a wide range of industries including foundry,
              automotive, utility, steel making, waste disposal, and others.  A
              cost-effective, inline sensor and measurement system to monitor NOX in internal
              combustion engines helps to meet EPA regulations.
