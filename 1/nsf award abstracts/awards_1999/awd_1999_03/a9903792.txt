Interpreting changes in forest and landscape patterns since
              European settlement has been an important objective of global change
              scientists, ecologists, natural resource managers, and conservationists seeking
              to understand the ecological consequences of broad-scale disturbance, to
              interpret modern forest conditions, and to manage the current landscape based
              on this information. Results from earlier research indicate that the vegetation
              of northeastern North America was undergoing pronounced changes for 300-500
              years before European arrival and that many of the forest dynamics ascribed to
              human land-use were actually continuations or modifications of trends initiated
              centuries earlier by climate change coincident with the Little Ice Age. Despite
              the compelling need to place forest and land-use dynamics within the context of
              changing environments and vegetation, there has been no integrated attempt to
              interpret pre- and post-European vegetation change in light of independent data
              on climate history and human activity. This research will use a multifaceted
              approach including paleoecological, paleolimnological, and historical methods
              to reconstruct climate, vegetation, and cultural dynamics over the past 1500
              years at sites arrayed across the climatic and forest gradients of New England
              and to place these results in a regional framework through analysis of pollen
              records. Results will provide: (1) an objective characterization of the Little
              Ice Age and climate history in New England, (2) comparison of pre- and
              post-European forest dynamics in relationship to independent environmental and
              land-use histories, (3) a re-examination of historical vegetation dynamics in
              light of prior climate and vegetation change, and (4) widespread availability
              of data and results through publications, symposium presentations, and the
              Harvard Forest Archives and web pages.
