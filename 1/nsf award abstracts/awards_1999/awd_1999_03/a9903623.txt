The supply and regeneration of nutrients in ecosystems are
              usually strongly influenced by microbial communities.  These processes can be
              particularly affected by environmental stress.  The salinity conditions in salt
              marsh ecosystems generate frequent occurrences of environmental stress and the
              dominant plant species in eastern US marshes, Spartina alterniflora, exhibits
              distinct patterns of growth forms that are correlated with changing salt
              conditions.   This proposal will test the notion that the changes in plant
              growth form in salt marshes are mediated by salinity induced shifts in
              bacterial N fixation,  a critical microbial process in the root zone.  The
              project will employ molecular biological techniques to examine the response of
              root-zone, N-fixing bacteria to key environmental stresses.  It will examine
              the generality of its findings by evaluating sites near the northern and
              southern limits of east coast S. alterniflora occurrence.  It will provide
              general insights into the responses of N-fixing bacterial assemblages to
              environmental stress.
