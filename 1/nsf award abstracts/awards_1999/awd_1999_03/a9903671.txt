Then population status of gray wolves and moose in Isle
              Royale National Park has been monitored for 40 years in this island ecosystem
              to clarify mechanisms of population regulation for both predator and prey.
              Pervasive top-down control of an associated three-link food chain
              (wolf-moose-trees) has been demonstrated, as tree growth rates fluctuate in
              concert with wolf density. On the other hand, bottom-up influence of resource
              abundance on moose dynamics is evident in density-dependent reproduction, body
              growth, disease incidence, and a historic die-off from starvation in 1996. In
              1999-2004 continued study will focus on (1) the potential for moose nutrition
              early in life to act as the major ecological integrator between bottom-up and
              top-down influences, and (2) the fitness of the wolf population, genetically
              isolated for 50 years and heavily inbred. This study represents one of the
              longest continuous studies of a three-link food chain in North America.
