The proposal describes work to investigate the effect of
              electronics state energy of relaxation, the variation of capture and escape
              rates with steady state quantum well carrier density, the impact of barrier
              height and width on transport rate, and the temperature dependence of the
              capture/escape processes. The proposed studies will utilize the four-wave
              mixing measurement techniques that have been pioneered by the PI in pass few
              years. The technique is capable of measuring frequencies ranging from a few GHz
              to in excess of 100 GHz. For this work the PI will collaborate with Lucent
              Technologies to obtain samples used in the experiment and analyzing the data
              for its impact on the laser performance.
