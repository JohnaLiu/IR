Abstract    :
                   This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project  will
              experimentally demonstrate that a tabletop point x-ray source reduces exposure
              time by a factor of at least 100.  The university partners in this project have
              demonstrated deep-sub-100 nm nanolithography using soft x-rays which enables
              fabrication of complex nanostructures with precision and accuracy on planar
              substrates.  However, the potential of soft x-ray nanolithography has been
              severely limited by the lack of inexpensive soft x-ray exposure tools. 
              Electron-bombardment point sources, which are currently used, have low power
              and efficiencies of O.01%. As a result, it takes several hours to complete an
              exposure.  SRL and its university partner propose to build a tabletop, dense
              plasma focus, x-ray exposure source that will have efficiencies of 1-2%.  The
              plasma source, which will be capable of radiating 10-20 watts of usable soft
              x-rays into 4  steradians, will reduce the exposure time by a factor of 100 or
              more.   In Phase II, SRL will fabricate a 100 pps source with the goal of
              creating a compact package that can be commercialized.  
     Deep-sub 100 nm
              lithography has potential applications in the biological sciences, thin films,
              optical components, displays and sensors, nanoelectronics and the organization
              and manipulation of macromolecules and nanoparticles.  In addition, a high
              power, kilowatt-class x-ray point source would provide a modular, affordable
              proximity source for x-ray lithography. The commercial market for
              non-semiconductor applications is predicted to be greater than $200 million
              annually.  A low cost, compact deep-sub-100nm lithography system is essential
              to exploiting these applications.
