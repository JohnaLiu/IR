It has been recognized that fault zones are
              discontinuous, and that fault rupture may be physically bounded in extent by
              geometric discontinuities, such as fault-plane offsets and bends, in the fault
              zone.  This project is to evaluate the effectiveness of geometrical structures
              in retarding dynamic rupture on segmented thrust faults.  The proposed work
              will:

1) Evaluate the effectiveness of thrust fault-plane offsets in
              retarding rupture, using a newly developed three-dimensional finite difference
              code capable of handling orthogonal, intersecting faults to model the
              interaction of parallel thrust fault segments with an offsetting tear
              fault,

2)Develop and apply a finite difference code to handle more general
              cases where the thrust fault segments are not parallel.  The results of the
              proposed work will be models to judge the effectiveness of segment boundaries
              in stopping thrust rupture, which will provide an improved basis from which to
              assess the size of potential future thrust earthquakes in the Los Angeles
              basin.
