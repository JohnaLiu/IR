Abstract    :
              The project focuses on an analysis of the trigonometric concepts and skills
              needed to successfully traverse a "knowledge supply chain" towards three
              technologically reliant fields: semi-conductor fields, graphic arts, and
              acoustic analysis and design.  The study is designed to examine how to
              establish an explicit linkage between career preparation for high technology
              positions ranging from technician to engineer or artist and the academic
              preparation of a high school in the particular instance of trigonometric
              reasoning.  It is believed that such redesign of school practice will be
              necessary to support a larger segment of the population in pursuing and
              mastering mathematics-related concepts and skills.
