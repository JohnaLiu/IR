This pilot project allows a young cultural anthropologist
              from Portland State University to travel to Sri Lanka to study labor migration.
               The project will compare the experience of Tamil speaking Muslim women who
              migrate to work as domestics with Sinhala speaking Buddhiist women in an
              otherwise comparable village.  Media representations and political rhetoric
              criticize women's absence from home as causing social disintegration, and
              describe many women as victimized in foreign countries, while many women report
              positive experiences from their work caring for Arabic families in the Middle
              East in terms of financial remittances to village relatives and self-image as a
              productive wage-earner.  The researcher will interview a small sample of
              households about changes in gender roles, kinship structures, class relations
              and economic strategies, to compare with prior research in a Buddhist village
              in the same region.  This research will shed new light on this large scale
              labor migration, assess the foreign experience's impact on the sending
              community, provide valuable information on this important region of the world,
              and assist a junior scholar to plan a major research project on this topic.
