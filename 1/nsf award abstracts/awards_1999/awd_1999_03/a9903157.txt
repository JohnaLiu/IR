        We will study and model the role of
              foreland basins in modulating the transport of sediment from mountain ranges to
              lowland rivers and estuaries, developing a quantitative, process-based model of
              sediment transport and storage, including fine-grained 'washload', by sinuous,
              mobile rivers. We will develop insights from earlier investigations of
              floodplain sedimentation processes along the Amazon River by studying
Andean
              tributaries of the Amazon as they cross the foreland basin of eastern Bolivia. 
              We have initiated field observations and satellite-image interpretation of
              these Bolivian rivers as an outgrowth of our prior study of the flux of
              sediment out of the Andes into the foreland basin.  The field study will
              include longitudinal transects along the river to measure channel
              characteristics required for flow and sediment routing along the
channel and
              into the floodplain, as well as transects across floodplains to collect
              sediment cores for 210Pb and 137Cs that will facilitate the testing of
              calculations and other hypotheses concerning processes that exchange sediment
              between floodplain and channel.  The field sampling will be conducted in the
              context of a mathematical model of sediment transport and storage (of spatial
              'reach-scale' 1-10 km and temporal scale 1 year) in a set of sinuous river
              channels crossing a broad floodplain.  The results of
our study will
              contribute to theories of the relationship between tectonism, fluvial
              geomorphology, and sedimentation in basins and along rivers.  The study will
              also address the fluvial geomorphic relationships between sediment transport
              and channel and floodplain characteristics, and will develop methods for
              sediment routing through mountain-front reaches of mobile channels and dynamic
              floodplains which are of interest to scientists, engineers, and resource
              planners concerned with the habitability of large alluvial valleys.
