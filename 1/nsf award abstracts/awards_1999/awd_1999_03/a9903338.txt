The Anchorage Museum of History and Art will develop "Lifting
              the Fog:  Russian Exploration in the North Pacific, 1728-1867."  This
              exhibition will reveal the world of the naturalists, oceanographers,
              astronomers, cartographers, ethnographers and artists who first described the
              west coast of America and the northern Pacific Ocean to the world. 
              Approximately 200,000 visitors to the museum will view the 5,300-sq. ft.
              exhibition.  Public programs will complement the exhibition, including a family
              day, lecture series by marine biologists, living history programs, weekend
              workshops, and an international symposium. An illustrated catalog with
              interpretive essays and a school curriculum and teachers' guide will accompany
              the exhibition.  The exhibition will travel to three additional venues in the
              United States.
