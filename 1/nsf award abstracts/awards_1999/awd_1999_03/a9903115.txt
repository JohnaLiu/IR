Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project wi
              I I refine technology for printing gate lines and data lines for active
              matrices of Thin Film Transistors (TFTs), which were shown to be feasible in
              Phase I. The  Phase II program aims to demonstrate materials and processes to
              replace most or all of the expensive photolithographic patterning steps in
              creating active matrices of TFTs by low-cost printing steps.  A further
              objective is to replace low-conductivity evaporated metallization by high
              conductivity printed silver or copper metallization to make possible truly
              large displays.  A further objective is to investigate materials to replace
              sputtered Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) pixels with printed ITO.  Materials and
              processes will be developed to electrostatically print lines of the required
              thickness and length.  Gate and data lines for a one-meter diagonal display
              will be printed on appropriate substrates, and their properties will be
              evaluated and optimized.  Materials will be developed to print ITO.  Laboratory
              prototype equipment for the deposition and printing steps in the process will
              be constructed and demonstrated.
     Successful results in this program can
              greatly reduce costs and scale-up in size for any equipment using an array of
              TFTS.  This includes active matrix liquid crystal displays and other display
              technologies, x-ray detector arrays, faxes and scanners.
