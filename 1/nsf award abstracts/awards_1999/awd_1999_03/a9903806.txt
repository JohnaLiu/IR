The investigators propose to continue measurements of
              shock temperatures in order to determine the high-pressure melting point of the
              major mantle minerals, MgSiO3 (perovskite) and MgO (periclase) of the lower
              mantle of the Earth.  The lower mantle extends from a depth of 670 to 2900 km
              and the corresponding pressures are 24 to 126 GPa.  Model calculations of the
              lower-most mantle yield temperatures of 3500 to 4000 K.  However, present
              laboratory (diamond cell melting) results that could place firm bounds on the
              peak temperatures of the lower mantle for MgSiO3 are very discrepant by nearly
              2000 K.  A similar discrepancy exists between a single experimental data set
              for periclase and a melting curve predicted on the basis of a well-accepted
              theoretical model.  Direct comparison between seismic velocities in these
              minerals at high pressure and high temperature with the seismic velocities at
              depths of the Earth would allow constraints on the temperature variations in
              the lower mantle which drive convection in the Earth.  The proposed
              determination of melting is based on previous research on shock melting of
              minerals such as Mg2SiO4 shocked to the pressure regime of the stability of the
              assemblage periclase plus MgSi03 (perovskite), and is expected to be
              accomplished using techniques the investigators have developed for preheating
              samples to temperatures of 1300 C prior to impact.  The 1995 discovery of a
              1-40 km thick apparently partially-molten region at the base of the mantle has
              motivated their plan to measure equations of state, sound velocities, and shock
              temperatures in molten silicates such as anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) diopside
              (MgCaSi2O6), fayalite (Fe2SiO4), and enstatite (MgSiO3) to pressures of ~150
              GPa.  These data will permit extending previous knowledge of the thermodynamic
              properties of molten silicates into a pressure regime where these data can be
              applied to understand the processes which give rise to this partially molten
              layer at the base of the mantle.
