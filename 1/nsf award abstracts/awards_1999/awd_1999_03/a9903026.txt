This project is to study continental seismic anisotropy,
              which has the potential to image patterns of lithospheric deformation and
              deeper mantle flow.  The study will invert variations in fundamental mode
              Rayleigh wave phase and amplitude data across dense broadband arrays in order
              to place constrains on the depth and lateral distribution of mantle anisotropy.
               The study will compare these models against results from shear wave splitting
              in SKS and other teleseismic phases.  The plan is to carry out these inversions
              in several regions:  the eastern margin of the North American keel in the
              northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada, the western margin of the North
              American keel in Colorado, the Colorado Plateau and Great Basin, and the Saudi
              Arabian Shield.
