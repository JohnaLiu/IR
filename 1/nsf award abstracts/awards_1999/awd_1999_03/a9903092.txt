This research by a cultural anthropologist from Portland State
              University examines the effects of the Personal Responsibility and Work
              Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 on single mothers living on
              Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, the home of almost 7,000 Sicangu Lakota,
              or Rosebud Sioux Amerindians.  The PRWORA instituted a program called Temporary
              Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a state-designed and administered program
              funded in part with federal block grants. The state government has recently
              enforced work requirements for all of its TANF recipients, and this project
              will conduct an ethnographic study of the effects of this dramatic change in
              welfare on a sample of 100 single mothers and their families.  Using
              participant observation and extensive life history interviews, the researcher
              will examine the costs of TANF in terms of child care, transportation, and
              clothing as well as intangible costs such as the effects on social networks.
              Half of the sample will be composed of mothers who have left TANF since January
              1997, and half will still receive TANF benefits. Subjects will be interviewed
              on survival strategies, food availability, clothing, cash and other resources,
              family and child welfare, and subjective orientations to work and welfare.  The
              project will provide valuable information for the local community, who is
              considering designing its own TANF program, as well as contribute to our
              understanding of the dynamics of poverty and welfare reform in a setting that
              has not been seriously considered in the research on welfare and  poverty, an
              Indian reservation.
