Abstract    :
              The explosive growth in demand for high-speed wireless data services 
has
              underscored the importance of bandwidth-efficient coding and 
modulation
              techniques for multipath radio channels. Recent 
information-theoretic results
              have shown that deploying multiple 
antennas at both the transmitter and
              receiver can dramatically 
increase the capacity of wireless channels, without
              sacrificing 
power efficiency to the extent required by single-antenna
              systems. 
To achieve these gains in practice requires new physical-layer
              
signal processing techniques (coding, modulation, decoding, 
equalization,
              and array processing) that more fully exploit 
the space-time structure of the
              multi-input/multi-output radio channel.  

The goal of this project is to
              develop new tools for the 
design and analysis of space-time coded-modulation
              on multipath 
radio channels. Two issues are addressed. The first deals with
              
methods to more accurately estimate capacity and code performance 
on
              channels with discrete multipath components. The second is 
concerned with new
              parallel encoding methods for space-time 
coded-modulation, which offer the
              performance gains of existing 
codes at reduced complexity. The ultimate
              objective of this 
work is to increase spectral efficiency and reduce power
              
requirements in wireless communication systems.
