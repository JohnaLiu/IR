Abstract    :
              Funds are transferred to NOAA to support two 1999 NOAA Sea Grant Fellows within
              the NSF Ocean Sciences Division.  Two highly qualified oceanography graduate
              students will work with OCE program staff for one year and participate in
              various activities related to ocean science research and marine education.  The
              Fellows will gain valuable first-hand experience by working on ocean science
              research policy and administration.  The Fellows will work with the
              Oceano-graphic Technology & Interdisciplinary Coordination Program and the
              Biological Oceanography Program.  The National Sea Grant Federal Fellowship
              Program is administrated through NOAA's Office of Oceanic Research Programs.
