This study addresses the historical biogeography and evolution
              of migration in four avian songbird genera, each of which is distributed on
              more than one continent.  Relationships among the species in each genus will be
              determined using mitochondrial DNA sequences, and the results will be used in
              two ways.  First, divergence dates will be applied to the ancestral nodes, when
              sister-species are determined to have evolved from a common ancestor in a
              clock-like manner.  Using these dates, the biogeographic history of each group
              will be analyzed to determine the relative roles of dispersal and vicariance in
              the development of inter-and intracontinental avifaunas.  By recognizing that
              both vicariance and dispersal are well established natural processes, and by
              attempting to correlate species divergence times with vicariant and dispersal
              events, more rigorous biogeographic hypotheses will result.  This will in turn
              increase the likelihood that specific isolating mechanisms can be identified
              within each group, thus increasing our ability to determine whether shared
              distribution patterns between groups are indeed the result of shared histories.
               Second, species-specific migratory behaviors will be mapped onto the phylogeny
              of each group; this mapping method will provide interesting insights into the
              development of migration within each genus.  In addition, this mapping method
              will generate insights into whether some, all or none of three explicit
              hypotheses concerning the evolution of avian migration are consistent with the
              evolution of migration in each of several intercontinentally distributed
              groups.
