This research has the ultimate goal of enhancing our
              understanding of the arc-anode attachment, particularly in the regions of
              unstable operation in order to establish guidelines for design of arcing
              devices with longer life and greater reliability.  Shorter term objectives are:
               (1) the development of methods to predict arc-anode attachment movement for
              nozzle anodes as a function of arc current, gas type, flow rate, and channel
              diameter; these parameters determine velocity and temperature distributions in
              the boundary layer and therefore the characteristics of the current transfer
              from the arc to the anode; and (2) determination of conditions for which a
              transition occurs form a diffuse arc-anode attachment to a constricted one in
              terms that are independent of the specific arcing configuration.  To accomplish
              this, a combination of modeling and experiments are performed for two different
              configurations: with the axis of the arc parallel to the anode and with the
              axis of the arc perpendicular to the anode.  Specific tasks include modeling of
              the arc-anode attachment instability for nozzle flow arcs with a
              three-dimensional dynamic model; experimental investigation of the arc-anode
              attachment movement in nozzle anodes to obtain the relationship between
              attachment velocity and the cold gas boundary layer thickness; and experimental
              investigation of the change in arc-anode attachment with an arc axis
              perpendicular to the anode as a function of plasma flow velocity and other
              factors.

Improved understanding of arc-electrode effects is essential for
              improving performance and lifetime in a variety of plasma devices such as
              discharge lamps, circuit breakers, arcjet thrusters, plasma spray torches, and
              arc heaters for metallurgical processing.
