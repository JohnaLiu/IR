Intercontinental fold and thrust belts located far from
              subduction zones or collisional sutures present puzzles for plate tectonics
              theory.  The Yin Shan fold and thrust belt of northern China is 1100 km long
              and trends east-west across the North China plate.  Recent work has revealed
              the presence of major thrusts and a series of compressional episodes during
              mesozoic time.  This project will continue investigation of the geometry,
              kinematics and timing of Yin Shan belt development in two transects.  Results
              are aimed at a test of whether or not severe intraplate deformation can develop
              independently of external plate interactions.
