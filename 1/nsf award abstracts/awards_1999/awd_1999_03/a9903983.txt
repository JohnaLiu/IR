Pearsall  /  Nolan
	This project supports the dissertation research of
              an anthropology student from the University of Missouri, studying how
              ecological, socio-demographic and cultural factors affect the acquisition and
              organization of ethnobotanical knowledge in central Missouri.  How people know
              what they know about plant resources and how plant knowledge is organized will
              be studied by interviewing twenty local plant experts and twenty non-experts in
              "Little Dixie", a well-defined cultural region of central Missouri. Various
              cognitive procedures will be used to distinguish experts from non-experts.  By
              examining the ethnobotany of this region through cultural and ethno-ecological
              techniques, the student will discover how and why plant knowledge varies among
              individuals and how the factors associated with ethnobotanical knowledge affect
              patterns of  plant use and classification.  The research promises to safeguard
              a valuable body of ethnobotanical information from a little-studied U.S.
              vernacular region. In addition the project supports the training of a young
              social scientist.
