Abstract    :
              
This proposal is focused on the potential of distributed amplification with
              dispersion management for high speed OTDM links.  Extensive theoretical and
              experimental work is to be performed to understand the role of noise,
              dispersion, nonlinearity and finite bandwidth in a distributed amplification
              link, leading to guidelines for the design of high-speed links of 100 Gbit/s.
              The research collaboration with Corning, the leading manufacturer of optical
              fibers, fits well within the scope of the GOALI program. Expertise in Corning
              to provide the specialty fibers to carry out the experimental part of the work
              will add tremendous value to the work, indicating its potential high impact to
              industry.
