Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)Phase I project aims to
              produce a  system based on the atomic force microscope (AFM) for nanometer
              scale imaging of biological samples that is orders of magnitude faster than
              current AFMs. In all of its forms, the microscope is probably the most widely
              used tool in the investigation of biological structure and function. The
              introduction of the atomic force microscope  extended the capabilities of the
              microscopes that are available to biologists to nanometer-scale resolution. The
              study of living and moving biological systems, on time scales of seconds, with
              nanometer scale resolution, is becoming increasingly important in biological
              research. Self-assembled monolayers, proteins, and cellular processes all fall
              into this category. Existing AFMs fall short of the requirements for these
              applications because of speed and sensitivity limitations in fluid operation. 
              Additionally, the new system will be optimized for fluid operation in order to
              give researchers active control over imaging dynamics. This composite system
              will allow researchers to probe nanometer scale biological phenomena at speeds
              never before accessible.                  Commercial applications of the
              proposed system include imaging and analysis of DNA, RNA, chromosomes, lipid
              bilayers, membranes, cell surfaces, proteins, protein arrays, protein crystals,
              and nonmembrane proteins.
