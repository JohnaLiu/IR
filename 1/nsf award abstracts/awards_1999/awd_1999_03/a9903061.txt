ABSTRACT

The cost and complexity of
              instrumentation required to conduct research have reached the point where it
              has become difficult, if not virtually impossible, for any one country to plan,
              construct and operate the large-scale facilities required to maintain currency
              in an increasing number of scientific disciplines.  Since 1992, the Megascience
              Forum of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has
              provided a venue where decision makers from more than 20 countries can engage
              in timely discussion and consultation on possibilities for international
              cooperation in large-scale research programs and projects.  This grant will
              constitute a portion of the US contribution to the work of the Megascience
              Forum.  It will enable NSF program managers in several fields, including
              materials science, nuclear physics, biological information, and radio
              astronomy, to continue consultations with their counterparts from other
              countries about the effective and efficient development of facilities in their
              disciplines.  Several other agencies, including the Department of Energy and
              the National Institutes of Health, are also making contributions to the
              continued work of the Forum.
