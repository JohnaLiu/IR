The direct effects of enriched CO2 on plants are
              becoming increasingly well known. However, how the interactions of plant and
              insects that feed on those plants under elevated CO2 is not very well
              understood.  This study proposes to address three questions about how
              populations and communities may be affected by changes in plant insect
              interactions in high CO2 atmospheres, using insect species from different
              feeding guilds reared on whole plants. The first experiment will determine how
              insects from different feeding guilds respond to a single host plant grown
              under elevated CO2. In the second experiment, both Nitrogen and CO2 treatments
              will be used to examine in detail the interactive effects of these
              environmental factors on both plant and insect performance.  The last
              experiment proposed in this study would examine the potential effects of
              altered herbivore preferences on plant competitive interactions within a
              multi-species host plant assemblage. It will greatly extend our knowledge of
              how the feeding responses of different insects to changes in host plant quality
              under high CO2 will affect both herbivore and plant performance. The components
              of this research will provide important insight into how elevated CO2
              atmospheres will affect insect-plant interactions at the individual,
              population, and community levels.
