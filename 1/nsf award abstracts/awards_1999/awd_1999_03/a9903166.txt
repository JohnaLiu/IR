The recognition of laurentian-affinity rocks in the
              precordillera terrane of Argentina has led to a suite of possible scenarios of
              Terrane translation and accretion during paleozoic time.  However, geologic
              relationships and age control of deformation are not sufficiently developed to
              be able to test between several current models.  This project will attempt to
              date and characterize anomalously low metamorphic grade shear zones in a high
              grade Cambrian arc that was subsequently juxtaposed against an Ordovician
              low-grade arc to the west and intruded by Devonian plutons.  Results should
              allow these shear zones to be correlated with tectonic episodes during the
              translation and accretion of these terranes, leading to a clearer picture of
              Paleozoic tectonism between North and South America.
