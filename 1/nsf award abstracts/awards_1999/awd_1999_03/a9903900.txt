	Red algae are exceptional for the great diversity in
              reproductive structures and for their complex life histories. One family of
              marine red algae, the Phyllophoraceae, in particular exhibits a wide range of
              life-history types, with corresponding diversity in morphological structures of
              the various diploid phases of the life cycle, and thus presents an opportunity
              to assess the phylogenetic importance of reproductive traits relative to the
              classification of the group. Type of life history and position of the
              reproductive structures on the plant body have traditionally formed the basis
              for identifying the 11 or so genera and ca. 100 species in the family; however,
              preliminary phylogenetic analyses inferred from DNA sequences of the plastid
              rbcL gene indicate a lack of correlation among the established taxa. This lack
              of correlation challenges the traditional taxonomy of the group.
	Dr. Suzanne
              Fredericq of the University of Southwestern Louisiana will use a comprehensive
              worldwide survey of the ca. 100 species of Phyllophoraceae (including the small
              group Petrocelidaceae) to generate new DNA sequence data from nuclear and
              plastid genes, and morphological data from detailed comparative studies of the
              same taxa. Integration of the molecular and morphological evidence will provide
              a phylogenetic framework for the entire group, from which can be reconstructed
              the sequence of critical developmental stages leading to the diverse "fruiting
              bodies" of these algae. Determination of the evolutionary relationships among
              the species of this family will also facilitate the study of their
              biogeographic distributions and migration patterns. As well, modern taxonomic
              monographs of the genera will be produced, incorporating the results of the new
              molecular evidence. An international network of colleagues is helping supply
              materials for the study, to be completed in collaboration with postdoctoral
              associate Juan Lopez-Bautista
