This project aims to compare geologic time scales based on
              astronomical
frequencies reflected in the sedimentary record with those based
              on the
40Ar/39Ar method.  The project will make use of readily dated volcanic
              ash
layers intercalated with rhythmically bedded Neogene strata in
              the
Mediterranean region.  Dating of these ashes by 40Ar/39Ar methods
              will
enable direct comparison with astronomical ages, rather than
              using
indirectly dated horizons such as geomagnetic polarity transitions. 
              Dating
and cyclostratigraphic modelling will be closely integrated with
              research
at the Universities of Utrech and Amsterdam.  An important product of
              the
project will be evaluation of the extent to which Earth's climate in
              the
Pliocene and Miocene has been modulated by variations of insolation due
              to
eccentricity, precession, and obliquity of Earth's orbit.
