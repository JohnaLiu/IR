Determination of ages of paleoearthquakes on faults is important
              for studies of earthquake recurrence intervals, temporal clustering, fault
              segmentation and other aspects of brittle failure.  However, chronology of
              paleoearthquakes is difficult to determine because landforms and deposits
              produced by earthquakes are difficult to date accurately by standard
              geochronological methods.  This project will further test and implement a new
              cosmogenic nuclide method of dating fault scarps, using selected scarps in the
              Great Basin.  Results are expected to advance knowledge of fault recurrence
              behavior and to help evaluate dating methodology.
