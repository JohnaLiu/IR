The boundary between the pacific plate and the North
              American plate is diffuse along the California sector of the West Coast of the
              US.  Recent measurements indicate that the Sierra Nevada block is moving
              northward relative to stable North America at about 10mm/yr, which is about 25%
              of the total Pacific/North America relative movement.  This project focuses in
              detail on the component of this active strain accumulation in the Lake Tahoe
              basin and the associated seismic hazard it implies.  A variety of mapping,
              structural and seismic studies are aimed at resolving two current hypotheses
              for the cause of active deformation.  Data collected will also be applicable to
              assessing the seismic hazard potential of this area.
