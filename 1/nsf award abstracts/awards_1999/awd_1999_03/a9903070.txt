This grant provides partial support of the costs to acquire an
              ultrasonic acoustic interferometer for the High Pressure and Temperature
              Laboratory at the University of Michigan.  This instrument will be used to
              measure the compressibilities of multicomponent silicate liquids. The
              ultra-high temperature capability of the apparatus (> 2000 degrees centigrade)
              will allow access to a wide range of melt compositions, including those with
              high liquidus temperatures (e.g. peraluminous liquids, molten peridotite) and
              those that are too viscous to obtain relaxed sound speeds below 1600 degrees
              centigrade (e.g. molten rhyolite).  Constraints on the temperature dependence
              of melt compressibility will be substantially improved by measuring relaxed
              sound speeds over temperature intervals spanning several hundered degrees.  The
              interferometer will also be used at lower temperatures on volatile-bearing
              liquids (containing fluorine and phosphorous) and a variety of carbonatite
              liquids under conditions where it is established that volatile loss does not
              occur. An additional application is to examine variations in the
              compressibility of silicate melts undergoing composition-induced coordination
              change of cations (Al3+, Fe3+, and Ti4+) at one bar.  These experiments will
              provide analogies for understanding the consequences of pressure-induced
              coordination change of these cations on melt density.  In addition to the P.I.,
              Rebecca Lange, other faculty at the University of Michigan who are likely to
              utilize the equipment in their research include Associate Professors Youxue
              Zhang and Lars Stixrude. This will be the first acoustic interferometer that is
              capable of ultra-high temperature work on liquids and is thus likely to attract
              outside users throughout the U.S.
