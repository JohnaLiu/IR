Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to
              develop a miniaturized biosensor for rapid in vivo determination of Li+ in
              human body fluids.  The biosensor will be based upon complexation between three
              independent surface bound crown ethers which will be able to identify and ratio
              Li+ ions against the common interferant ions Na+, or K+.  Coordination of the
              ion/s will be detected by Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy. This project
              will consist of a series of experiments which, if successful, will allow 
              development of a miniaturized user-friendly, fiber-optic probe to detect a
              positively charged ion (cation, e.g. Li+) in low concentrations in body fluids.
              Logical progression will comprise adapting an existing SPRS surface
              modification technology to the tethering of the ion selective crown ethers for
              Li+, Na+ and K+. This project will include the synthesis and purification of
              the crown, 4-aminobenzo-12-crown-4 as this compound is not available
              commercially.  Further, the chemically modified surfaces will be examined for
              selectivity against each individual ion and in the presence of a mixture of all
              three.  Finally, the limits of detection will be addressed. 
       A
              completed miniaturized portable device based on this proposed research will
              rapidly and reliably detect ionic concentrations/imbalances in human or
              biological subjects. This device will monitor lithium (Li+) in known bipolar
              disorder patients under lithium therapy.  In situ rapid detection will minimize
              clinical laboratory time, increase the "safety net' against over-medicating,
              and provide the patient/doctor with instant feedback to determine appropriate
              dosage.
