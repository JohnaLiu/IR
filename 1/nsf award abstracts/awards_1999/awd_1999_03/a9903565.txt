Abstract    :
              This workshop is intended to bring together a group of research scientists,
              educators, and students to present and discuss research topics on the
              fundamental theoretical aspects of detection, estimation, and classification
              and emerging application areas in which further theoretical results are needed.
               The most prominent area in which these further theoretical results are needed
              is in imaging.
