This award supports cooperative research on seismic imaging
              and Ocean Drilling Program ground truthing between Australian Geological Survey
              Organization researchers and Mike Coffin and post-doc Tadeusz Gladczenko from
              the University of Texas at Austin's Institute for Geophysics.  This project is
              supplementary to work funded under OCE 9714368. 

The Kerguelen Plateau in
              the southern Indian Ocean and the Ontong Java Plateau in the western Pacific
              ocean are the two largest flood basalt provinces known on Earth, each being
              approximately one-third the size of the contiguous United States.  Through
              focused geophysical and scientific drilling programs on each, the PIs are
              attempting to understand better the mantle processes responsible for their
              formation, their volcanic and plutonic histories, and their relationships to
              global environmental and biotic change.  Multichannel seismic reflection work
              on the Kerguelen and Onton Java plateaus, followed by scientific drilling of
              the two features are attempting to address the outstanding scientific
              problems.

The work plan involves a three-month collaboration with scientists
              at the Australian Geological Survey organization, which has multichannel
              seismic profiles of the majority of the eleven ODP sites on the Kerguelen
              Plateau.  While these data are typically available only for purchase, through
              the collaborative project the U.S. PI and post-doc will have access to the data
              and to associated geophysical data which will be analyzed and published
              providing important access to key data to the scientific community in the
              process.
