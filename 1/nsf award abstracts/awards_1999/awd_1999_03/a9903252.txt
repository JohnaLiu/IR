	The proposed research will focus on using iron (Fe)
              isotopes to trace the role of microorganisms in the geochemical cycle of Fe in
              the Archean to Mid-Proterozoic, covering the earliest Earth (3.8 billion years
              ago), to a period of rapid change in atmospheric conditions about 2 billion
              years ago.  Our goals are to develop an "isotopic fingerprint" that uniquely
              records biologic activity, but is relatively immune to later changes, such as
              alteration of rocks by younger geologic processes.  The "isotopic fingerprint"
              will rely on the observation that microorganisms fractionate the relative
              abundances of the four stable isotopes of Fe (54Fe, 56Fe, 57Fe, and 58Fe)
              through selective preference for the lighter masses.  We propose that the
              isotope composition of Fe will provide a powerful means to evaluate the role of
              microbes in the geochemical cycling of Fe in the Precambrian, which is critical
              for accurately interpreting Precambrian atmospheric conditions from the rock
              record.
