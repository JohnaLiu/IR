The objective of this research is to conduct a field
              test to better define the mechanisms of bedrock erosion occurring in streams
              draining the Central Range of Taiwan, and to quantify the amount of bedrock
              erosion as a function of stream hydraulic and sediment transport variables. In
              order to accomplish this goal we must measure bedload transport rates at
              selected field sites in the study area. Therefore a secondary goal is to apply
              the passive acoustic technique of Thorne and colleagues, developed under marine
              conditions, to measure bedload transport in these steep mountain streams. To
              our knowledge it is a
first attempt at this effort. The result will be a
              dataset of bedrock wear rates as a function of local sediment fluxes and other
              important variables such as intrinsic bedrock erodibility, channel hydraulics,
              and grain size of the material in transport. This dataset will be used to test
              theoretical derivations, with the ultimate goal a process-based, field
              calibrated fluvial bedrock incision law.
