A remarkable property of biological diversity is the
              patterning that is observed when characteristics of organisms are compared. 
              While some features show considerable variation and can uniquely identify
              individuals within a population, other traits are less variable and are shared
              by large groups of related species.  Although biologists have long recognized
              the importance of variation as the raw material for future evolution, the
              reasons why variation may sometimes be lacking are less often studied.  This
              lack of variation could be due to constraints on evolution, caused by a lack of
              genetic variation or by genetic correlations with other traits.  Alternatively,
              the lack of variation could result from natural selection eliminating unfit
              variants and maintaining a narrow range of traits that are well-adapted to the
              environment.  

In this research, a novel combination of artificial selection
              in the greenhouse and studies of natural selection in the field will be used to
              determine whether constraints or selection cause the low levels of variation
              found in two sets of floral traits. The research will be done using the wild
              radish (Raphanus raphanistrum Brassicaeae) and two aspects of anther
              morphology, the ratio of long- and short-filament lengths and the extent of
              long-filament exertion beyond the corolla.  The basic understanding of
              constraints and selection generated by this research may be applicable to
              understanding a variety of applied evolutionary problems, such as whether crops
              and wild species can adapt rapidly to global climate change, conservation of
              endangered species (which often lack genetic variation), and the evolution of
              resistance to antibiotics, pesticides, and herbicides by pathogens and
              pests.
