Abstract    :
              This conference will bring together scientists from chemistry and from atomic,
              molecular and nuclear physics to discuss topics of common interest. The cross
              disciplinary interactions at this conference are expected to lead to new ideas
              and perspectives, particularly for the young investigators for whom support is
              requested.
