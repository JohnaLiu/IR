              Experimental Partnerships: Audit Trails: Content, Storage and Processing

The
              main thrust of this research is the investigation of the interrelated issues of
              content, representation, storage and processing of audit trails in computer
              systems.  Existing audit mechanisms on various systems are being analyzed and
              extended, experimental collection and reduction systems for audit are being
              built, and experimentation with tools to analyze audit data for intrusion and
              misuse are being performed.  This research builds on ongoing work in which
              progress has been made on prototyping an audit representation and  compression
              tool and developing two different intrusion detection techniques.  An important
              benefit of this work is that undergraduate and graduate students involved are
              acquiring a unique combination of skills, spanning computer security, systems
              and modeling, and data structuring.  The project leverages considerable
              industrial support and the results and prototyped software could be used by
              industry to enhance existing audit mechanisms and intrusion detection
              systems.
