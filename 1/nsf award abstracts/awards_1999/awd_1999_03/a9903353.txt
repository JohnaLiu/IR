Abstract    :
              The proposed research concerns the development of tools to analyze and design
              separation processes using the mass transfer modeling approach.  These tools
              allow one to identify multiple steady states in distillation  column models, an
              important piece of information in control system design.  In addition, one of
              the problems faced in  developing distillation flowsheets for separating
              non-ideal mixtures is coming up with  feasible sequences for the flowsheet. 
              These are not obvious, especially in highly non-ideal systems and the concept
              that is to be used here involves calculating residue maps for the system.  As
              part of this proposal the PI has developed a plan to do experimental work,
              including a planned  collaboration with Bacardi Corporation, to complement his
              theoretical work studying the existence of multiplicities in azeotropic
              systems.  The research is intended to focus upon non-equlibrum models, the
              equilbrium case having been more completely studied in the prior literature in
              the field.
