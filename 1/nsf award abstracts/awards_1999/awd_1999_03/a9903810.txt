Living placental mammals comprise a group of approximately
              4,000 species that are classified into 18 different orders (e.g., rodents,
              primates, rabbits and pikas, elephants, sea cows).  Resolving evolutionary
              relationships among these orders has proved difficult.  Fundamental questions
              concerning the evolutionary history of mammals remain unsettled.  How did the
              breakup of ancient supercontinents affect the evolutionary
history of mammals?
              How did the extinction of dinosaurs and other large reptiles 65 million years
              ago influence the evolution of the major groups of mammals? How frequently have
              different kinds of adaptations (e.g., echolocation systems for navigation
              during flight) evolved among mammals?  One approach to reconstruct evolutionary
              genealogy is to use DNA sequences. In our study, we will obtain DNA sequences
              for seven different genes from 97 placental mammals. The mammals that were
              chosen for this study are representative of all major groups. In addition to
              reconstructing an
evolutionary genealogy, we will estimate divergence times
              among mammalian
orders using a molecular clock. The evolutionary history that
              we reconstruct using molecules will provide a framework for evaluating how
              continental breakup and mass extinction have influenced mammalian evolution. We
              will also examine the origins of mammalian adaptations in light of the
              evolutionary tree that we obtain with DNA sequences.
