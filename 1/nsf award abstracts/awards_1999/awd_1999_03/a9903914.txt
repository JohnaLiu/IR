The goal of this project is to determine the factors that
              influence the reproductive success of steelhead trout.  Is reproductive success
              random, or do some individuals produce most of the offspring that survive to
              maturity?  It is hypothesized that large males will dominate access to females
              and will have most offspring, and females breeding after the stream's winter
              floods subside will be most successful.  It is also hypothesized that
              hatchery-produced fish will be less successful than wild fish.  DNA
              fingerprinting techniques will be used to determine the number of offspring
              from parents that survive all the rigors of life in freshwater and at sea to
              return and start a new generation.

Many populations of steelhead trout and
              their close relatives, the Pacific salmon, are in serious jeopardy; several are
              already listed under the Endangered Species Act.  One response to these
              population declines has been to produce fish in hatcheries for recreational and
              commercial fisheries.  This project will evaluate the current practice of
              enhancing steelhead populations with hatchery-produced fish.  These steelhead
              differ from wild fish in the timing of spawning and body size--two traits
              hypothesized to affect reproductive success.  The study will help determine the
              best practices for conservation of steelhead and salmon populations.
