Extension in active compressional orogensis is
              counter-intuitive but has been documented in several mountain ranges. 
              Understanding of the circumstances under which extensional forces develop in a
              compressional tectonic environment is hampered in ancient examples because
              timing of the features commonly is not sufficiently precise to establish
              contemporaientry, and strain accumulation is not active.  The Taiwan orogenic
              belt provides a unique opportunity to conduct this type of work because it is
              active, accessible, relatively well studied and substantial geodetic
              infrastructure is available, including regional-scale GPS, leveling and
              triangulation studies. The project includes new GPS monuments and geomorphic
              studies.   Results include a new, integrated data set to constrain the
              regional-scale architecture of the orogenic belt and a modern analogue for
              models of extension proposed for older, more deeply eroded belts where plate
              kinematics are less well constrained.
