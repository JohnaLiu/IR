Snowpacks collect and store acid deposition and chemical
              pollutants from the atmosphere throughout the winter.  In the spring, these
              pollutants are released into watersheds in a very short time; the first 30% of
              melt contains up to 80% of the solutes.  Such an intensive release of acid and
              other chemicals significantly affects water quality and aquatic
              environments.

This project focuses on developing a quantitative
              understanding of the chemical and physical controls on the isotopic and
              chemical compositions of snowmelt at two well-equipped snow laboratories: 
              Central Sierra Snow Laboratory in California and Sleepers River Research
              Watershed in Vermont.  The integration of isotopic and chemical analyses of
              these two sites will provide a more complete understanding of the processes
              controlling meltwater generation than is possible when either tracer is used
              alone.  Rare earth elements (RFTs) will be used as chemical tracers within the
              snowpack.  These tracers will not only identify and trace water from individual
              snow events, but also provide data that will help elucidate the profiles and
              snowmelt.  This will enable us to evaluate isotopic redistribution within the
              snowpack during snow metamorphism and the modification of this composition by
              liquid-ice exchange as water percolates down the snow column.  Cold room
              experiments, conducted at the U.S. Army's Cold Regions Research and Engineering
              Laboratory, will complement the field studies by allowing us to monitor oxygen
              isotope values of snowmelt as a function of different melt rates and grain
              size.  Both the field and experimental data will be used to develop and
              parameterize physically based models of isotopic and chemical transport through
              the snowpack.  Ultimately, the understanding of contaminant transport gained
              from this work will be extended to entire watersheds.
