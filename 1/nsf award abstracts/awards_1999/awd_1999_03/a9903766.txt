The investigators will expand their continuously recording
              Global Positioning System (GPS) network on Kilauea volcano to better understand
              volcanic and seismic deformations.  Two GPS stations will be added in the
              epicentral region of the most recent large earthquakes, the largest of which
              was M7.2.  Annual measurements imply a change in the pattern of deformation at
              several sites prior to a M5.5 earthquake in June 1997.  The new stations will
              help constrain deformation rate changes within this nucleation zone.  The
              investigators will test whether the data collected before the June 1997
              earthquake can be explained by a decrease in slip-rate on the decollement
              beneath Kilauea.   Techniques will be developed to rapidly analyze the GPS data
              to determine near real-time estimates of deformation, and to model these data
              to better constrain seismic and magmatic processes.
