Comparison of strain accumulation and release a long
              relatively discrete, rapidly moving plate boundary fault zones has led to
              considerable insights into the dynamics of plate interactions in tectonic
              situation such as Japan and coastal California. However, less is known about
              dynamics of diffuse intraplate fault systems.  Ongoing investigations are
              providing measures of contemporary strain accumulation across the Basin and
              range of central and Eastern Nevada and this project will obtain a precise
              chronology of late quaternary strain release in the same area.  Comparison of
              the two date's sets should provide a test of how well this method can be
              applied to an intraplate system and should help understand the dynamics of
              Basin and Range faulting.
