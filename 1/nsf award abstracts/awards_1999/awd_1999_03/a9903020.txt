The proposed research is a combined laboratory and numerical
              study of crystal growth and dissolution of a mineral + melt mush in simple but
              geologically relevant multicomponent systems (CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 and
              CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2). The study will address the following questions regarding
              mass transfer in a silicate mush: (1) if crystals and interstitial melt are in
              local chemical equilibrium during mass transfer; (2) the rate limiting factors
              and mass transfer mechanisms for crystal growth and dissolution; (3) the rate
              of crystal growth or dissolution; (4) the effect of mineralogy on interstitial
              melt composition; and (5) if chimneys can be formed in a solidifying magma
              body. It is hoped that by using a combined laboratory and numerical study of
              crystal growth and dissolution in a silicate mush we will be able to gain
              insights into the processes and mechanisms of mass transfer in a mushy zone,
              better our understanding of magma differentiation processes.
