Trace element distribution between coexisting minerals have
              been
demonstrated to reveal aspects of the history of rocks that are
              not
recorded by major elements. This arises because of (1) the relatively
              slow
diffusivity of trace elements in minerals such as garnet, (2) the
              extreme
partitioning behavior of many trace elements, and (3) the sensitivity
              of
trace element concentrations to small amounts of reaction progress or
              P-T
changes. This study seeks to explore the application of trace
              element
geochemistry in metamorphic rocks towards a deeper understanding of
              Earth
history.
	Suites of rocks from several well-characterized localities
              will be
examined for trace element zoning in garnet and coexisting
              minerals.
Observed zoning patterns will be correlated with the distribution
              and
compositions of accessory phases such as xenotime, monazite,
              zircon,
apatite and allanite. The zoning patterns will be explained in terms
              of the
whole-rock reaction history and the temperature dependence of trace
              element
partitioning between garnet and accessory phases will be calibrated
              using
P-T conditions inferred from other thermobarometers.
	The results of
              this research will provide new, detailed insights
into the geologic evolution
              of the areas studied and will, more generally,
provide new tools for the
              petrologist to apply to the unveiling of Earth
history
