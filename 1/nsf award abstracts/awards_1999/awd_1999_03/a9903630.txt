Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project combines a
              number of key innovations to develop a refractory, highly stable, and
              ultra-high sensitivity SiC-GaAlN MEMS sensor platform suitable for operating in
              harsh (high temperature, high pressure, corrosive, and high energy-radiation)
              environments. This harsh-environment sensor platform is enabled, for the first
              time, by the integration of three recent innovations: (1) bulk micromachining
              of single crystal SiC, (2) growth of nitride semiconductor Quantum Well
              Structures (QWS), and (3) the giant piezoresistance (GPR) effect. GaN-GaAlN QWS
              devices will be fabricated onto micromachined device-quality single crystal SiC
              substrates using patented SiC micromachining technologies. SiC is an ideal
              substrate for growth of nitride semiconductors, and both SiC and GaN-AIN
              compounds have high (3.0-6.2 eV) band gaps, high melting temperatures
              (1700-3000 degree C), and excellent mechanical and chemical properties making
              them eminently suitable for use in harsh environments. The versatility of the
              giant piezoresistance transduction, SIC-GaAIN sensor platform will first be
              demonstrated by fabrication of highly sensitive temperature and pressure
              sensors. 
        Commercial applications will be in: (a) advanced
              aeropropulsion control systems; (b) automotive and utilities combustion control
              systems; and (c ) chemical processing facilities.  The proposed harsh
              environment sensor platform has commercial applications for monitoring of
              pressure, temperature, flow, acceleration, and sound in advanced aeropropulsion
              control systems (e.g. turbine engines), automotive and utilities combustion
              control systems, and chemical processing facilities.
