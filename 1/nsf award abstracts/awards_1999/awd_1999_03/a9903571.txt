Abstract    :
                    This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project aims to
              validate the technical feasibility of three critical and innovative steps,
              namely precursor synthesis, drying and curing, and thermal processing. The
              proposer will conduct a program of experimentation and characterization.  The
              proposer has developed a novel process concept for synthesizing advanced
              non-oxide ceramic materials with nanocrystalline microstructures.  The concept
              is based upon thermal treatment of precursor molecules adsorbed on an activated
              carbon substrate.  After drying and curing, the impregnated carbon is processed
              at elevated temperature within a controlled furnace atmosphere to produce
              ultra-fine, high purity synthetic materials.   The proposer with technical
              support and assistance from its partner will attempt to validate its process
              concept by producing nanocrystalline boron carbide and boron nitride.  The
              quality and particle size of the experimental products will be ascertained by
              advanced x-ray diffraction methods.
        If successful, this concept will
              be commercially applicable to an extremely wide range of ceramics and synthetic
              minerals.
