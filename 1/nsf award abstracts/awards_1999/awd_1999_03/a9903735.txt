The mantle comprises the largest fraction, by mass and by
              volume, of the Earth. Geologic processes within the mantle profoundly influence
              major features (ocean basins, mountains) at Earth's surface. In spite of its
              importance, all knowledge of the mantle is from indirect geophysical
              measurements or from small, rare samples. Diamonds and associated minerals are
              among the most prominent of these samples and are major source of information
              about the mantle. An important variable is their oxidation state, but this has
              been difficult to determine. We plan to measure the oxidation state of
              iron-bearing mantle minerals such as garnets, pyroxenes, and spinels, many of
              which occur as tiny inclusions within diamonds, in order to determine their
              ferric/ferrous ratios, which we will then use to calculate the oxidation state
              of the mantle. We will use an electron-beam-based analytical technique called
              electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) for the measurements. EELS is done
              with a transmission electron microscope, which means measurements can be made
              on extremely small samples or regions of samples, a major benefit when dealing
              with, for example, inclusions in diamonds. A major goal will be defining the
              limits of EELS at the nanometer scale by using a series of well-characterized
              mantle minerals and comparing the technique to results from other methods that
              utilize coarser crystals. The results will be more precise and accurate
              analyses plus new insights into the oxidation state of the mantle.
