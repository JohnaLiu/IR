The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network is
              requesting a three-year grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to
              provide continued support for the QEM Network's Science Student Internship
              Program (SSIP).  NSF support would be used to provide ten-week summer science
              policy/research internships at NSF to five students.  Specifically, QEM is
              requesting funding for the three-year period (Fiscal Years 1999-2001) at the
              current funding level of $60,000/year.

Each year of the grant period, five
              talented students (one graduate and four undergraduates) majoring in
              science-related fields will be placed in internship position with mentors at
              NSF during the summer.  The selected students will have ten-week, full-time
              internships with the additional responsibility of carrying out science-related
              community outreach activities when they return to their respective campuses the
              following academic year.
