Recent evidence indicates C4 plant ecosystems contracted
              significantly following the Last Glacial Stage (LGS) and suggest rising CO2
              during the global warming facilitated the expansion of C3 plants.  However, the
              same pattern could result from an increase in water availability from the
              relatively dry conditions during the glacial stage.  We will test the relative
              importance of CO2 versus water availabiltiy on the Pleistocene-Holocene
              distributions of terrestrial plant ecosystems using core samples from
              Mesoamerican mountain lakes.  Specifically, we will evaluate molecular and
              isotopic distributions of biomarkers for land plants and algae extracted from
              sediments in lakes that experienced wetter, drier or similar conditions during
              the LGS relative to today.
