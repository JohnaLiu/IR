Dr. Ramond seeks funding to support young physicist to attend
              the "Higgs and Supersymmetry Conference" to be carried out on the campus of
              Florida University.  This Conference will address the important physics issues
              related to Higgs and supersymmetry.  Results from the current experiments will
              be presented by members from CDF, D0, DELPHI, and HERA.  Members from CMS and
              ATLAS will talk about detectors that are under construction for operation at
              LHC.  The Conference will also discuss one of the next generation colliders,
              the muon collider.
