This US-Argentina collaborative award establishes a two
              year international research collaboration between Dr. William D. MacDonald,
              SUNY Binghamton and Professor Juan Fancisco Vilas, Universidad de Buenos Aires,
              on the tectonic aspects of the initial break-up of Pangea: the paleomagnetic
              evidence from Argentina.

The investigation will study the intensity and
              direction of residual magnetism in the ashflow deposits estimated to be from
              the Permian to Triassic age; clarify tectonic events preceding the crustal
              break up of Pangea; and reinforce important underpinning assumptions in current
              tectonic models for the Paleozoic to early Mesozoic evolution of South
              America.
