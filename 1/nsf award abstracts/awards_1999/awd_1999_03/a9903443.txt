Previous work has demonstrated that coral "microatolls"
              offer an unrivalled opportunity to test models of earthquake recurrence,
              because they record vertical deformation through several large-earthquake
              cycles quite precisely in their morphology and annual banding.  Between the
              western coast of Sumatra and the trench of the Sumatran subduction zone,
              several collected slabs of head corals record sea-level changes caused vertical
              interseismic and coseismic deformation.  On the islands of the outer-arc ridge,
              work has documented sudden emergence of 1-2 meters during the giant earthquake
              of 1833, and corals uplifted similar amounts during two earlier events about AD
              1608 and 1380 suggest such events might recur about every 230 years.  In
              periods between these large emergence events, coral heads record rapid
              submergence within 130 km of the trench, rapid emergence between 130 and 200 km
              of the trench, and near-stability on the mainland coast, about 240 km from the
              trench, and this pattern may be consistent with interseismic strain
              accumulation models.  This proposal will continue the investigation of the
              Sumatran subduction zone, studying the giant 1833 event and its predecessors
              using coral stratigraphy, morphology, and geochronology.
