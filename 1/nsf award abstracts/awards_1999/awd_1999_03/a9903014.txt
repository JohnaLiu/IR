Interpretation of recent seismic observations for the Earth's
              lower mantle is dependent upon a detailed understanding of the physical and
              chemical properties of materials under these extreme conditions. Understanding
              the Earth's lower mantle is also crucial to answering fundamental questions
              about the Earth's origin, evolution, and structure.  This work will examine
              crystal structures, phase relations, and equations of state of lower mantle
              minerals and mineral assemblages through experimental measurements conducted
              directly under the pressure (25-135 GPa) and temperature (1000-4000 K)
              conditions that exist within the deep Earth.  The experimental technique will
              combine in situ synchrotron x-ray diffraction with double-sided laser heating
              in the diamond anvil cell.  The experimental program will include study of
              single phases relevant to the lower mantle, as well as complex mineral
              assemblages.  For the latter, new techniques using area detectors will be
              developed.  The results of these studies will be used to address fundamental
              questions regarding the nature of the lower mantle.  Specifically, the
              mineralogy and bulk composition of the lower mantle will be explored through
              combination of experimental results with seismic data.
