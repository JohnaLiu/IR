Abstract

This dissertation research examines the
              changing understanding of work in a Canadian Inuit community and the manner in
              which the changes are reflected in the processes of integration into the
              culture, values, and economy of the post-industrial state.  The project
              considers the ways in which externally imposed notions of work discipline have
              been adapted to local needs in the Canadian Arctic.  The ways that contemporary
              Inuit deal with the process of "making a living" is very different than it was
              75, 30, or even 15 years ago, and therefore understandings of and attitudes
              toward work are also different.  Data on the contemporary situation will be
              drawn from ethnographic fieldwork in the Copper Inuit community of Holman. 
              Longitudinal changes with be shown through comparisons of historic documents
              and ethnohistorical sources, previous ethnographic fieldwork in the same
              community, and through the use of government manpower and social welfare
              statistics.
