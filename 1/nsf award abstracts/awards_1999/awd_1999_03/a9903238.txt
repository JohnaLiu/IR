This study will derive estimates of relationships among
              Early-Middle Devonian gastropod species and quantify morphologic variation
              among those species.  The study will examine trends in two key features
              associated with "modernization" of gastropods: 1) the increased diversity of
              species bearing shell ornament and 2) the decreased diversity of nearly-flat
              shelled species.  The study will test several hypotheses concerning the
timing
              and biological-level of those trends, including 1) hypotheses attributing the
              patterns to the diversification of jawed fishes and other predators, and 2)
              hypotheses attributing trends to changes in extinction/speciation dynamics vs.
              those attributing trends to shifts in morphologic evolution.
