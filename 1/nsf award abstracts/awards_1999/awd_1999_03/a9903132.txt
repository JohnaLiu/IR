Models and numerical simulation tools to address
              nucleation, crystal growth and Ostwald stepping in diagenetic systems are
              developed and used to gain an understanding of their role in the evolution of
              the state of sediments during burial. Nucleation phenomena are modeled by
              simulating the coupled dynamics of the particle (crystallite) size
              distributions for the participating mineral chemistries and polymorphs. The
              size distribution of each phase is allowed to evolve with rates that account
              for particle size and shape through the dependence of the rate and equilibrium
              constants. A new numerical technique is introduced that allows for the
              simulation of particle growth from monomer and dimer to
macroparticles (
              10-23-mer). The algorithm is used to simulate the spatial variations of the
              particle size distributions across a layer of sediment. Application of the
              theory is made to systems with polymorphs of illite (platy or fibrous) or the
              many-polymorph system.
