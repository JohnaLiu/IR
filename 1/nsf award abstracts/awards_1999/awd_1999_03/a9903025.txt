	This award supports the development of an algorithm for the
              inversion of magnetotelluric (MT) measurements to three-dimensional models of
              the electrical resistivity structure of the earth's crust and upper mantle. The
              interpretation of MT observations provides a method for imaging deep earth
              structure that is complementary to and independent of seismic modeling. The
              inversion of MT data is a difficult computational problem. To date it has
              proven practical only for 1-D and 2-D modeling. This project will apply the
              method of nonlinear conjugate gradients to improve on previous approaches to
              3-D modeling in MT. If this project is successful, the resultant 3-D imaging of
              the electrical resistivity will significantly improve our understanding of the
              earth's internal structure and processes and also improve geophysical
              techniques for mineral exploration. This is a two-year project involving
              personnel from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and GSY-USA, Inc; a
              small company specialized in geophysical exploration techniques.
