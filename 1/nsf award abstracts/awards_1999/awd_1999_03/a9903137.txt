One of the most important sources of data used in the
              development of models of mantle processes is the diversity of lava compositions
              we observe on the surface of the earth.  Obtaining such information is hampered
              by the processing that magmas undergo during transport.  Unmodified magmas may
              be sampled from melt inclusions in crystals that form early in the history of
              the magma.  Melt inclusion data has demonstrated that there is a wide range of
              magma compositions generated in the mantle.  However, there is still much that
              we do not understand about how melt inclusions were trapped, and how the
              composition of melt inclusions relate to the magmas.  This investigation will
              focus on three issues: (1) The compositional effects of the process of
              formation re-heating on melt inclusions; (2) The phase equilibria of anorthitic
              feldspar in natural basalt.  Feldspar is one of the most common minerals in
              ocean floor lavas, yet our understanding of the conditions and compositions
              under which they form is still very poor; and (3) To address the first two
              issues, and to model the formation of the oceanic crust, we need data on how
              elements distribute themselves between feldspar and magma.  These issues will
              be addressed in a series of experiments designed to develop a means for
              creating synthetic melt inclusions, and to create basaltic melts that mimic the
              near-primary magmas represented by the melt inclusions.
