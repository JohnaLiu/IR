This project is to study dynamic ruptures in fault zone
              structures containing material interfaces, geometrical discontinuities, and
              rheological heterogeneities.  The studies will combine and extend previous 2D
              computational models and develop a basic 3D framework for related calculations.
               As shown in the previous work, the incorporation of a material interface in
              calculations of dynamic rupture leads to a host of new phenomena that do not
              exist in a laterally homogeneous solid:  dynamic rupture along a material
              interface can thus potentially provide an explanation for a number of important
              geophysical problems including the heat flow paradox, short rise time of
              earthquake slip, and trapping of rupture in existing fault zones.  The
              additional incorporation in this study of a gouge layer, fault offsets, more
              realistic rheology, and increased dimensionality may modify some of the
              previous results.  This project will examine quantitatively these differences
              and their consequences for the earthquake failure process and associated
              seismic radiation.
