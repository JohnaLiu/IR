The investigators will address North America plate
              dynamics by modeling the forces applied to the plate and comparing the
              predicted stresses with those inferred from the style of ongoing tectonics and
              those observed in drill holes.  Modeling will be done with the finite element
              method.  Input forces applied to modeled North America will include boundary
              and basal forces, and those generated internal to the plate (arising from
              potential energy variations such as those created by topography). The relative
              magnitudes of applied forces will be estimated to account for stress and
              deformation information.  Furthermore, because the magnitude of many of the
              forces applied North America are well known a priori (such as ridge push), the
              magnitude of all the applied forces will be well constrained.  Tectonic
              stresses deform North America at a rate inversely proportional to its strength.
              Strength will be modeled with a viscous rheology, which wil be estimated by
              ratioing the calculated stress with the (reasonably well-known) strain rate.
              This research can be divided into several tasks: 1) estimation of input fields,
              2) description of an appropriate finite element representation of North
              America, 3) evaluation of model predictions against observables, and 4) as
              modeling progresses, toward resolving the input fields and assessment of their
              uniqueness.
