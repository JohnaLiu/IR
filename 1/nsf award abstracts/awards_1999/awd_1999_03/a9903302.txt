This U.S.-Bulgaria Cooperative Research award is for a
              project on "Geometry of four-manifolds and twister spaces" between Dr. David E.
              Blair of Michigan State University, Dr. Tedi Draghici of Northwestern Illinois
              University, Dr. Brendan Foreman of Case Western Reserve University, and Drs.
              Johann Todorov Davidov, Oleg Krastev Mushkarov, Vestislav Dragomirov Apostolov
              of the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics of the Bulgarian Academy of
              Sciences. The objective of this proposal is to further develop research
              collaborations between the PI and two of his recent Ph.D. students and
              researchers from the Bulgarian Institute.  The researchers propose to study:
              (1) Twistorial construction of Kahler and almost Kahler metrics; (2) Reimannian
              symmetric and 3-symmetric twistor spaces; (3) Twistor spaces with harmonic
              almost-complex structures; (4) Minimality of sections of twistor spaces; (5)
              Classification of compact *-Einstein Hermitian surfaces; (6) Classification of
              compact bi-Hermitian surfaces; (7) Compact almost-Kahler 4-manifolds with
              special Weyl tensor; (8) Complex contact structures on twistor spaces; (9)
              Complex contact structures on Lie groups; (10) Curvature and conformally Anosov
              flows on contact manifolds. 

This research in mathematics fulfills the
              program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and
              Bulgaria to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
              mutuality of benefit.
