Abstract    :
              
This project is a joint effort of analytical and experimental studies of
              hybrid controlled structures with soil-structure interaction (SSI) to be
              conducted between University of Missouri (UMR) and Tongji University under the
              US-China Earthquake Protocol, Annex III.

The research at UMR includes:
              development, verification and refinement of the optimal control algorithm
              including intelligent feedback gain and observer technique as well as optimum
              controller robust placement; design and fabrication of experimental facilities
              for super-hybrid damper-actuator-control system; software development and
              computer simulation of structural response of various structural models for a
              wide range of ground motions; stability of components and system
              identification; shaking table tests; and numberical simulation of structural
              models

Research to be conducted at Tongji University includes: analytical
              study and shaking table test of soil characteristics such as shear and bearing
              capacity of a foundation model; fabrication of structural model according to
              soil capacity; shaking table test of hybrid controlled structures; and field
              experiments with blast-loading to verifty Tongji shaking table test results and
              UMR analytical results.

This is a US-PRC cooperative research project.
