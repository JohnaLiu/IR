Rock, 9903604

This project proposes to derive an assessment of the
              potential climate change impacts on the New England area.  The study comprises
              one regional component of the ongoing U.S. National Assessment on the potential
              consequences of climate variability and change.  The proposal focuses on human
              health, forestry and water.  It proposes to develop the infrastructure needed
              to enhance community interaction and outreach with impacted stakeholders.  It
              further proposes to assess the potential impacts through analysis of recent
              conditions and scenario predictions interpreted for the area.  The results
              should identify areas for decision and additional research.  A number of
              databases will be developed to provide information for future decisions
              affecting the New England area.
