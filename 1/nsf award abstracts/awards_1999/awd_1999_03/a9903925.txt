ABSTRACT


	This
              project will test whether density-dependent natural selection (natural
              selection that operates differently at different levels of crowding) is
              responsible for a major life-history divergence in a small north Florida fish. 
              One facet of the work will examine long-term numerical dynamics of two fish
              populations and the species in their communities.  The other facet will be an
              experimental study of whether natural selection at different levels of crowding
              will re-sort the genes responsible for different life histories in different
              populations. 

	Density-dependent selection for life histories, the idea that
              populations that experience characteristically different regimes of crowding
              ought to exhibit characteristically different life histories, is fundamental to
              population biology.  The concept was once hypothesized to account for much
              natural life-history diversity; it has also been the foundation for ideas about
              whether stable population dynamics can evolve or whether exploitation of
              fisheries by reducing fish density will alter the life history of the fishery
              species.  Yet the empirical support for the entire concept is weak and
              circumscribed.  This study will develop a model system from natural populations
              for testing the concept and understanding how it works (if indeed it does) and
              how it can be used in a variety of applications.
