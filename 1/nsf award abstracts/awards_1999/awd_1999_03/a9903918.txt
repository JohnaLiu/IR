This project explores the mechanisms by which organisms adapt
              to changing environments. Novel environmental conditions can lead to the
              expression of genetic variation which was present but not expressed in
              conventional environments. Novel environments can also lead to developmental
              instability.  The extent of environmental dependency of gene action and
              developmental stability is not known. The genome project plant, Arabidopsis
              thaliana, will be used as a model organism. Atmospheric CO2 levels will be
              manipulated to produce conventional and novel atmospheres, ranging from lowest
              pre-Pleistocene CO2 concentrations to the heretofore unexperienced  high CO2
              concentrations expected in the next century. Using a combination of physiology,
              biochemistry, growth analysis and quantitative genetics, this experiment will
              determine: 1) the extent of shift in genetic variation expressed as a function
              of the extent of change in the environment, and 2) the metabolic and
              developmental mechanisms which drive the changes. 

Given the current rate of
              human-induced environmental change, it is imperative that we understand the
              extent to which the biota on which we depend can adapt to those changes. This
              study will contribute to accuracy in the prediction of the biotic consequences
              of both local and global environmental perturbations. This model system will
              also contribute to an understanding of plant responses to changing atmospheric
              carbon dioxide, an important biological and economic question.
