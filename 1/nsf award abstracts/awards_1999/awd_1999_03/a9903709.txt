Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to
              develop a sensory suite that is capable of long-term monitoring of groundwater
              and aquaculture systems, using a newly-developed technology that replaces
              conventional membrane technology. One of the largest problems facing field
              biologists and aquaculturists is the inability to prevent "fish kills". 
              Potential causes for these kills include ground water contamination from
              domestic wastes, industrial effluents, or large rain events, all of which
              dissolve oxygen (DO), the primary gas necessary for life in aquatic organisms.
              Given continuous monitoring, biologists could be alerted to low DO
              concentrations, or factors effecting DO, and thus potentially prevent a kill.
              However, continuous monitoring by personnel is not practical because of
              staffing and equipment constraints.  Instruments currently available to measure
              DO fail in that they utilize a membrane that rapidly fouls and must be replaced
              to maintain accurate readings.  
         This technology could be used to
              continuously monitor: (1) aquaculture production, (2) water quality for
              endangered species, (3) water quality above and below factory effluent points,
              (4) water quality in remote areas that are inaccessible for
              daily/weekly/monthly sampling, and (5) compliance with EPA guidelines. 
              Additionally, fully developed applications of this technology could be used to
              control/regulate discharge (1) at wastewater treatment facilities, (2) at
              factories and processing plants, (3) on farms, and (4) at power plant cooling
              water discharge points.
