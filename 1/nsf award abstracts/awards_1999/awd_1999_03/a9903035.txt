Abstract    :
              The proposal requests partial support for a symposium to be held in Spring of
              1999 on the topic of Cognition and Instruction.  The results of the symposium
              would be published as the 30th in the series of Carnegie Cognition Symposium
              volumes.  The aim of the symposium would be to review progress and highlight
              major accomplishments during the past 25 years since the first Carnegie
              Symposium on Cognition and Instruction.

A dozen of the leading researchers
              in the field would describe the contribution of their work to that
              progress.
Participants will include both seasoned researchers who have been in
              the field since its inception as well as promising new investigators from a
              variety of disciples related to cognition and instruction, including cognitive
              development, instructional psychology, intelligent tutoring, and collaborative
              learning.  In addition, the speakers and the discussants -- including active
              researchers and "gatekeepers", such as journal editors and funding agency
              decision makers -- will identify remaining challenges and suggest possible
              research and development avenues to resolve these issues.  The plan is for a 3
              day symposium with expected attendance of between 150 and 200 people.
