The PIs will convene a workshop of 12 philosophers to
              address a set of issues related to future research priorities in the Earth
              sciences.  These questions may be summarized in the question "What should a
              future contract between the Earth sciences and society look like?"  The
              workshop will provide a means for the philosophic community to contribute to
              current thinking on the nature of Earth science research and the relationship
              between the Earth sciences and society.
