Abstract    :
                  The primary goal of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I
              project is to produce high-density PZT ceramic/polymer nanostructures. 
              Piezoelectric, ceramic actuation technology, which forms the basis for smart
              structures because of quick spouse, low power 'consumption, compactness and
              ruggedness has two key process limitations-low generativeforce and low
              displacement.   High density, a primary requirement for these ceramic materials
              can be obtained by a unique processing technique developed at MMI. In this
              Phase I project, MMI and Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA will collaborate
              to work on the synthesis and rapid consolidation of nanocrystalline
              PZT/polymerflexible composite smart nanostructures.  Upon completion of this
              project this collaborative effort will have established the effects of rapid
              processing on performance characteristics, including piezoelectric, dielectric
              and viscoelasitc behavior of the new smart structures. In Phase II these
              composite nanostructures will be commercialized for Active Vibration Control.

                  PLZT/polymer composite flexible actuators will have widespread applications
              in Optics, Photonics
Measuring Technology (scanning microscopy, mirror
              positioning, adaptive optics, auto focus systems), Disk Drives (MR head
              testing. vibration cancellation), Microelectronics (wafer and mask positioning,
              critical dimension, measurement pumps and shock waves)
