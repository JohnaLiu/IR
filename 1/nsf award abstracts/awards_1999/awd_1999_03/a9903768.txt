Since the Himalayan orogeny is very active, the
              accompanying earthquake seismicity can be used to test tectonic models of
              faulting.  Knowledge of the seismicity in the region is so far limited, based
              on single component local network and teleseismic recordings.  This project
              will deploy 21 broadband seismometers in eastern Nepal and southern Tibet.  The
              main studies and their purposes are:  (1)  teleseismic P and S arrival times
              and waveforms will be used to decipher the general crustal and upper mantle
              structures under the Himalaya to determine the presence of subduction zone and
              other structures, (2) the arrival times of hundreds of earthquakes under the
              orogen will be used to image the 3-D crustal structures underneath the Himalaya
              and relocate earthquakes to determine the internal structure and rheology of
              the orgogen, (3) SKS anisotropy under the Himalaya will be used to map upper
              mantle flow, and (4) focal mechanisms from regional moment tensor inversion
              will be used to determine kinematics of orogenic deformation.
