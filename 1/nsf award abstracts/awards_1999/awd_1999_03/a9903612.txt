Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) grant aims to develop novel,
              high scalable, process technology to fabricate ordered arrays of semiconductor
              quantum dots using ordered protein templates.  Protein templates with
              well-defined pore structures combined with powerful low electron energy etching
              (LE4) dry etch techniques provide an ideal mask to create nanoscale patterns
              directly in the substrate.  Well-ordered nanostructures can ten be formed
              directly by self-assembly of adatoms deposited onto the patterned substrate. 
              These techniques will be used to create semiconductor quantum dot arrays than
              can revolutionize infrared detection for both commercial and military
              applications.Recent developments in quantum mechanical devices enable the next
              generation of optical and electrical devices with improved performance. 
              Quantum mechanical devices, however, also require ordered periodic
              nanostructured arrays that require new large area, scalable fabrication
              technologies to be commercially viable.  Currently, these nanostructures are
              typically formed by either liquid phase deposition (Langmuir-Blodgett films) or
              serial etching techniques such as e-beam or x-ray lithography.  Standard
              lithography techniques produce the desired structures, but are serial (i.e.,
              each features is made one at a time, one after the other) limiting realistic
              large-scale fabrication.  
      Novel nanofabrication technologies to create
              quantum dot structures would allow the next generation of infrared detectors
              that would outperform existing semiconductor devices.  Improved infrared
              devices could revolutionize thermal imaging and night vision applications such
              as military and civilian surveillance and security, see-through-smoke
              applications in firefighting, and thermal imaging of people buried in collapsed
              buildings.
