Abstract    :
              The investigators will examine a mechanism that may increase the rate of
              atmospheric ice formation through contact nucleation of supercooled droplets.
              The mechanism involves electrical forces between charged contact nuclei
              resulting from the evaporation of charged droplets at cloud tops and charged,
              supercooled water droplets at cloud tops. Charging results from conductivity
              gradients at cloud boundaries due to vertical fair weather currents in the
              global electric circuit. This mechanism may be a significant source of ice in
              the atmosphere. If the mechanism is proven to be a source of ice it may mediate
              physical connections between solar processes and terrestrial weather and
              climate. Such connections are suggested by various statistical studies, but
              identification of a causal link has proved to be elusive. The main effort is to
              calculate details of the mechanism, and to incorporate the mechanism into a
              model of global electricity. This model will permit an assessment of
              meteorological effects.
