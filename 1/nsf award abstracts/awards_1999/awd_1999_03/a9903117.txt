Bulk transfer equations for heat and mass transfer from
              surfaces are very useful in land surface models due to their simple
              formulation.  However, vegetation surfaces introduce several complications for
              their use because of their effects on turbulent transfer and on the temperature
              profile within the canopy. Some of these problems may be mitigated by producing
              a scalar roughness for use bulk transfer equations which accounts for processes
              within the canopy.

The objective of this proposed research is to model
              canopy temperature profiles and their effects on the bulk transfer equations,
              and to develop simple empirical equations to determine the canopy temperature
              profile characteristics without the use of complex multi-layer canopy
              models.

The methods to be employed will be to first employ a multi-layer
              radiative transfer model to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the factors,
              which affect the canopy temperature profile.  These include solar elevation,
              turbulence and radiation intensity, soil moisture and canopy density and
              structure.  The radiative transfer model and the methods employed to estimate
              the scalar roughness would be validated by means of intensive canopy
              temperature profile measurements.

The significance of the proposed
              activities is that they will develop a method to deal with vegetated surfaces
              in Land surface models and weather models without having to incorporate complex
              canopy models.  The results should improve the output from weather prediction
              models.
