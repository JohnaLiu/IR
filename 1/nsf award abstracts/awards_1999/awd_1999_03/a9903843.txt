This award supports initial stages of collaboration on
              study of two types of correlated electron systems, rare earth magnets and
              semiconductor quantum dots, between the Universities of Minnesota and
              Wisconsin, and Vietnam National University, Hanoi; the National Center for
              Natural Science and Technology, Vietnam; and the Technical University of Hanoi.
               The proposed research is an outgrowth of discussions held in Hanoi January
              1998 during the Science and Technology Week, partially supported by NSF.

The
              Vietnamese have already established research strength in the area of rare earth
              permanent magnets, an important area for Vietnam, which has significant rare
              earth reserves.  The combination of the Vietnamese experimental work in this
              area with the modeling support available through the collaboration is promising
              for a mutually beneficial research partnership. The work on quantum dots is
              relevant to an area of considerable interest, the failure of the simple random
              matrix theory model to predict the energy level structure of disordered quantum
              dots.  Vietnamese scientists have experience in modeling that will complement
              the approach of the US team and will contribute to understanding this problem,
              which underlies much of the current fundamental experimental research in
              nanostructures.
