African lions defend joint territories that contain enough
              food, water and shelter for successful reproduction. However, some prides
              consistently reproduce at higher rates than others, presumably due to
              differences in the abundance or distribution of key resources within their
              territories. This LTREB project will use long-term demographic and ranging data
              in a GIS analysis to measure the value of specific landscape features to lions
              living in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania. These data will
              clarify the influence of landscape heterogeneity on territory size and local
              population density and provide the foundation for game-theoretical models of
              group territoriality. The overall population data will also be used to
              determine whether lion numbers are regulated by food, disease, or territory,
              and will be used to assess whether the recent decline in the Ngorongoro Crater
              has resulted from the cumulative effects of close inbreeding. These analyses
              involve collaborations with scientists in Canada, South Africa, Tanzania, and
              the UK.
