This project will begin the excavation of a newly discovered
              deposit of extraordinarily preserved insect and plant fossils endangered by
              semi-annual flooding by the waters of a Reservoir on the Upper Missouri River.
              The age of these fossils from the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene fills a gap in
              our knowledge of the flora and fauna of this region. This unique quality and
              age, combined with the high taxonomic diversity represented, will allow
              insights into the evolution of the flora and fauna of the Northern Rocky
              Mountain Region during a critical period.  During this award, we will 1)
              excavate the site and preserve the fossils discovered; 2) determine the age,
              context and extent of the site; 3) identify and describe the insect diversity
              represented; 4) investigate the conditions under which such outstanding fossils
              of delicate specimens were deposited; and 5) place the site in a regional
              context.
