This project from Centenary College is for a planning grant
              which will result in the design and capability to perform a large-scale,
              comprehensive initiative for the reform of science teaching in all Bossier
              Parish elementary schools (grades K-5).  A Planning Task Force of the various
              stakeholders in the area has emerged and together the group will plan the
              content and specifics of the enhancement project.

By making site visits to
              other successful teacher enhancement projects which share similar logistics,
              community parameters, and evaluation methods, the Task Force will develop a
              comprehensive initiative that will go forward for future consideration as a
              major funded project.
