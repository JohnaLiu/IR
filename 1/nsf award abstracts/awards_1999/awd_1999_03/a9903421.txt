Understanding the nature of refugia for native species in
              heavily invaded communities is both a scientific challenge and a conservation
              necessity. For example, California meadow communities are largely dominated by
              alien annual plants; remnant native species still persist, but there is a lack
              of quantitative knowledge of where they persist and why. Like many questions in
              ecology, this one must be addressed at a large spatial scale. This research
              will determine how soils, topography, land use and spatial isolation interact
              to affect the distribution of native meadow plants in a 130,000 hectare region
              of northern California. Two main hypotheses will be tested: (1) The
              distribution of native diversity is predictable at a regional scale, and (2)
              native species diversity depends on invasibility and isolation. The first
              hypotheses will be address by a carefully designed, stratified sampling regime.
              The second hypothesis will be addressed by highly controlled manipulative
              experiments. This project will be one of the first attempts to quantify
              patterns of native and alien species diversity at a regional scale, in a highly
              invaded terrestrial community. It will also be one of the first studies to
              examine the role of spatial isolation in creating refugia for native species.
              Finally, it is designed to contribute to an ecosystem management effort that is
              currently underway in the study region.
