This project will investigate the atomic scale mechanisms that
              accompany compression for the important upper mantle minerals including
              pyroxenes, garnets and olivines. The experimental work will involve obtaining
              the crystal structures and Raman spectra of various pyroxenes and garnets at
              pressures to 40 GPa, as well as at modest temperatures below 550 C.  Using this
              data, as well as those obtained from the literature, the structures will be
              examined with current electron density models to understand bonding changes,
              especially around the bridging Si-O-Si linkages in pyroxenes and the Si-O-M
              linkages in garnets (M = octahedral cation).  A general understanding of the
              pressure effect of framework modifiers will be developed. Furthermore, O-O
              interactions will be modeled in order to investigate the response of the
              closest-packed lattice to pressure. These models will aid our understanding of
              the nature of crystalline phases at conditions of the upper mantle. They will
              also provide a general background to understanding the influence of framework
              modifiers on all sorts of important industrial materials such as zeolites and
              non-linear optical behavior, (e.g. KTP).
