Abstract    :
                     This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to
              further develop a revolutionary approach to nanostructure fabrication.  This
              Near-Field Scanning Optical Nanolithographic approach which has already been
              shown to be capable of writing 100nm width lines, utilizes a direct, optical
              write technology in conjunction with optical photoresists.  The direct optical
              writing is performed with a customized Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscope
              (NSOM) tool.  The major goal of the proposed work is to design and construct an
              NSOM lithography tool and demonstrate processes for flexible pattern generation
              on 4 inch wafers.  Phase I work will involve design of the NSOM lithography
              tool and photoresist process demonstrations using the proposer's novel
              inorganic hydrogenated amorphous silicon resist, as well as conventional
              polymer resists.  Fundamental studies of the oxidation of hydrogen passivated
              silicon will be performed.  Phase II will see the construction and
              demonstration of the NSOM lithography tool.
       An NSOM lithography tool
              with sub-100nm resolution will be much cheaper than e-beam lithography systems,
              making nanolithography available to a much broader range of scientists and
              engineers within the research community, thereby accelerating the level of
              innovation in nanoscale IC technology
