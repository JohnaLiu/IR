This study will examine the role of "top-down versus
              bottom-up" control in insect populations. It will provide a unique opportunity
              to address these issues and to assess spatial variation and may have many
              applications in the control of planthopper populations. This study will use a
              series of field and laboratory experiments coupled with path analysis and
              structural modeling. In particular, this research will investigate the
              individual and interactive effects of two abundant invertebrate predators (wolf
              spiders and mirid bugs) which co-occur on the Atlantic salt marshes of North
              America. It is hoped it will determine the consequence of their interaction on
              the population and growth of their shared prey, a common planthopper that feeds
              on the phloem sap of Spartina cordgrass. The ability to predict the combined
              effects of multiple predators is critical both to the refinement of
              predator-prey efforts and to the improved management of severe agricultural
              pests such as planthoppers
