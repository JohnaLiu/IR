The 1999 Gordon Research Conference on "Rock Deformation: 
              Grain Bondaries, Interphrase Boundaries, and Surfaces:  Structure, Properties,
              and Processes", will be held August 10 - 15, 1999 at Colby-Sawyer College, New
              Hampshire.  The goal of the conference is to discuss advances in our
              understanding of the structure and properties of mineral surfaces, interfaces
              and grain boundaries, and to discuss the physics and chemistry of the processes
              that occur at these interfaces.  The community is poised to incorporate new
              ideas fro other fileds to advance the state-of-the-art in research on Earth
              materials.  There will be wide participation in the conference from a variety
              of perspectives including scientific discipline (geophysics, geochemistry,
              tectonics, structural geology, petrology and materials science), instituition,
              demogrpahy, etc.  Funds will be used to insure the broad participation of
              students and young investigatiors located far from New Hampshire.
