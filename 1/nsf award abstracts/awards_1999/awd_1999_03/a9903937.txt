Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for the support of the 1999 National Engineers Week
              Teleconference for Middle and High School Students.  The Tenth Annual Discover
              Engineering!  Teleconference entitled, "Engineers Turning Ideas into Reality,"
              will be broadcast nationwide during National Engineers Week on Wednesday,
              February 24, 1999.  The purpose of this teleconference is two-fold.  First, the
              program provides U.S. middle and high school students and their teachers with
              an interesting insight into the work and career opportunities of engineers in a
              novel teleconference setting.  Second, the Discover Engineering! telecast
              serves as the centerpiece of community open houses at many industrial,
              government and college locations.
