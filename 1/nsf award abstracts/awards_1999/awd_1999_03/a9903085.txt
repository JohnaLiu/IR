The main objective of this project is to develop
              methods to directly measure the ejected mass in volcanic eruptions as a
              function of time by combining a fluid mechanical model with seismological data.
               A secondary goal is to use the measured mass ejection rate to study the
              initiation process of volcanic eruptions.  The eruptions to be studied include
              1) the 1964 Shiveluch eruption in Kamchatka; 2) eruptions at Karymsky,
              Kamchatka, during the summer of 1997, for which high quality digital data are
              available; 3) small eruptions of Mount St. Helens which continuied throughout
              1980; 4) several erutpions of mount Asama, Japan; and 5) the 1991 eruption of
              Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.  The information obtained from this study
              will provide constraints on the characteristics of volcanic eruptions and will
              also be important for quantifying volcanic hazards.  For example, the measured
              mass ejection rate will provide a direct constraint on dynamical models of an
              eruption.  At Mount St. Helens, the blast had an exceptionally large mass flux
              compared to later events.  This difference may clarify the distinguishing
              features of blasts and help account for their disproportionally devastating
              effects.
