Abstract    :
              Professor Phillip E. Savage will study the partial and total oxidation of
              organic compounds in supercritical water.  These reactions are applicable in
              waste treatment as alternatives in incineration.  The effect of water
              concentration, pressure, and temperature on reaction rates will be uncoupled,
              using inert gases as diluents.  The role of dielectric constant and cage effect
              of the water as a function of density, will be separated from its role as
              reactant, and studies with mechanistic kinetic models.  Quantum chemical and
              molecular dynamics calculations will be performed to study the influence of
              water molecules on the rate of H202 dissociation.
