Lathrop

This instrumentation development project seeks to understand
              magnetic field generation by the flow of liquid metals (dynamo action) through
              carefully controlled experiments in liquid sodium.  The goal is to better
              characterize and to better understand the dynamo theory that seeks to explain
              magnetic field generation for the Earth and other astrophysical bodies. 
              Lathrop et al. will develop a new experiment which will consists of a rotating
              inner and outer spherical boundary with convecting liquid sodium in between.
              Additionally, they will undertake a direct comparison between this experiment
              and numerical simulations to be performed by Gary Glatzmaier at the University
              of California, Santa Cruz.  These comparisons will afford a direct test of the
              model assumptions used in modern simulations of the earth's outer
              core.
