Abstract    :
              This project proposes  to evaluate models for the origin of the Ethiopia/Afar
              hotspot by examining the seismic structure of the crust and upper mantle
              beneath the Ethiopian Plateau, the Afar Depression, and the Main Ethiopian
              Rift.  The proposed seismic experiment is part of an international,
              multi-disciplinary collaborative project focused on the Ethiopia/Afar hotspot. 
              Broadband seismic recording will be conducted the PIs and French colleagues,
              and will be complemented by gravity, GPS, structural field mapping, and
              geochronology studies conducted by scientists from France and the U.K.  The
              seismic experiment will consist of 17 broadband stations (7 US, 8 French, and 2
              permanent) deployed for two years and an additional 20 stations (all US)
              deployed for one year.  The velocity structure of the upper mantle beneath
              Ethiopia/Afar will provide important new information on the physical and
              compositional nature of mantle plumes.
