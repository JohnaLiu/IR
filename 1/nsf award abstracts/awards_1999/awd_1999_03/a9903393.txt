              ABSTRACT

OCE-9903393


Investigators from Princeton University and the
              Bermuda Biological Station will synthesize  the inorganic carbon data from the
              U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (U.S.JGOFS), the World ocean Circulation
              Experiment (WOCE), and other projects into a comprehensive picture of the
              global inorganic carbon distribution in the surface ocean, including
              anthropogenic carbon dioxide.  Similar attempts have been made in the past, but
              this will be the first time that high-precision carbon system measurements will
              be brought together to permit a realistic modeling of the sea-air exchange of
              carbon dioxide.  The resulting mappings are expected to be useful for the
              development of models of time-varying regional and global carbonate system
              parameters.
