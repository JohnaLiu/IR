This US-Mexico dissertation enhancement project will support
              research by Mr. Jon Christopher Brown under the direction of Dr. Steven P.
              Darwin, of Tulane University, to work with Dr. William J. Folan, Universidad
              Autonoma de Campeche, on forest communities of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve
              (CBR), in Campeche, Mexico. 

The research will inventory all woody plant
              species growing in the archeological zone of the CBR, develop a descriptive
              analysis of the forest communities of the preserve, and compare the
              geographical distribution of tree species relative to historical patterns of
              settlement and land use within the CBR site.  The proposed study will establish
              permanent sampling stations at varying distances from the center of the CBR
              archeological zone and develop benchmarks for the detection of future change in
              forest species composition within the reserve.  The project will also increase
              our understanding of how distributions of economically important tree species
              are significantly influenced by ancient land uses.
