Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102. It provides partial
              support for two years for an OC-3 connection. Applications involve data mining,
              surface metrology, non-invasive imaging for stroke research and
              atherosclerosis; distributed computing, cryptography, wireless LANs, caching,
              vehicle crashworthiness research, fire protection engineering, and spacecraft
              electric and chemical propulsion. Other efforts include the ODEToolkit project,
              global project centers, and a digital library. Collaborating institutions
              include but are not limited to: the Swiss Federal Laboratory for Materials and
              Testing in Thun, University of Massachusetts Medical School, the Central
              Massachusetts Magnetic Imaging Center, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory; NASA, the
              Metals Processing Institute, the Center of Wireless Information Technology, and
              the New England Center for Mixed Signal Processing.
