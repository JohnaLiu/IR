Abstract    :
              

A program is proposed to provide an multifaceted research and educational
              experience for undergraduate students in environmental biology.  The program
              will attract freshman and sophomore students to experience environmental
              biology early in their academic careers.  A diverse array of environmental
              biologists will serve as mentors for these students.  Students will gain
              research experience in project ranging from hormonal control of mating behavior
              to the biogeochemistry of urban environments.  Recruiting and retention efforts
              for this program will be focused on groups that are generally under represented
              in environmental biology.  Participants are expected to include a mixture of
              Latino, American-Indian, and African-American students.  The program will
              involve careful mentoring not only of students by faculty but by younger
              students by older students.  Careful documentation of student participants will
              be used to assess and modify the program as a permanent university feature.
