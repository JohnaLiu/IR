This award will provide partial support for the acquisition
              of:  (i) a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (VASE); (ii) a dynamic
              contact angle (DCA) system; and (iii) an interfacial rheometer (IFR).  These
              instruments will provide important new capabilities for investigating
              adsorption of self-assembling organic molecules at solid/liquid and
              liquid/liquid interfaces and their organization in thin film geometries. 
              Understanding the physics and chemistry of adsortive and organizational events
              at interfaces is essential in their subsequent technological application,
              ranging from biological modifiers to molecular semiconductors. 

This
              equipment will also play a major role in training both undergraduate and
              graduate students at the Department of Chemical Engineering at North Carolina
              State University in new hands-on laboratory courses in interfacial science. 
              These new capabilities would provide crucial information for the growing
              interdisciplinary research program in polymer and surfactant interfacial
              science, electronic materials, and environmental science at North Carolina
              State University and enable it to remain strong and vital in the years
              ahead.
%%%
This equipment will significantly enhance capabilities to
              understand interface phenomena of organic molecules, and to train students in
              several interdisciplinary areas.
