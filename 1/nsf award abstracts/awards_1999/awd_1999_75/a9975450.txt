This
              award will support outside speakers in the Connecticut Logic
Seminar, which
              usually meets at Wesleyan University and draws
participants from New York,
              Connecticut, and Massachusetts.  The
seminar provides a forum for recent work
              in a wide range of
logical topics, including model theory, set theory,
              recursion
theory, proof theory, and computer science.

In recent years the
              number of connections between logic and other
parts of mathematics has
              increased, as evidenced by applications
of model theory in algebra, number
              theory, and analytic function
theory.  This has resulted in attendance at the
              seminar by
researchers from areas outside logic, a trend which the
organizers
              expect to continue and plan to foster by including
speakers whose work is of
              broad interest.  Speakers and
participants include representatives of every
              career stage, from
graduate students through distinguished senior leaders, and
              past
editions of the seminar have led to new collaborations
              between
researchers and shaped the training and theses of
              graduate
students.
