Abstract    :
              This award to Professor Kathy Rowlen at the University of Colorado-Boulder is
              supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry
              Division and the Solid State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials
              Research.  The research will focus on the relationship between the
              nanostructure of metal particles and films and their optical properties. The
              first part will be a study of the Raman scattering enhancement (SERS) of silver
              nanoparticles using near-field scanning optical microscopy. The particles will
              be prepared by photochemical reduction of solid silver halides via near-field
              excitation or by reduction of silver halides at the scanning tunneling
              microscope tip. Once conditions have been established  for formation of an
              optimally SERS- active particle, systematic studies of the relationship of
              particle size and shape to optical properties will be conducted. The second
              part of the research will be a determination of the chemical and physical
              parameters that affect nucleation, growth and stability of copper, gold and
              silver thin metal films on nonmetallic surfaces such as silicon, silica, mica
              and alumina. Surfaces will be characterized by atomic force microscopy and
              optical properties of the films determined by uv-vis spectroscopy and SERS.
              Computational modeling of surface nucleation and film growth will complement
              experimental studies.
