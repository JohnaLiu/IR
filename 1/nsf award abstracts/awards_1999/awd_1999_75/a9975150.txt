Abstract    :
              Dev Thirumalai is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to continue his studies of protein folding and protein
              dynamics.  Thirumalai has shown in his previous work that many details of the
              kinetics of protein folding may be understood in terms of the characteristic
              temperatures that determine the phases of proteins.  He has predicted the
              folding time scales and the mechanisms in terms of the underlying
              thermodynamics.    In the next phase of his research he will focus on three
              major areas involving protein folding: 1) he will develop simple off-lattice
              models that include the effects of side chains and chirality with the purpose
              of understanding the kinetics and thermodynamics of peptide fragments; 2) he
              will use molecular dynamics simulations to probe the action of urea as a
              denaturant on model systems; 3) he will exploit simple models to gain an
              understanding of the general principles that govern chaperonin-mediated protein
              folding.  Much of this work relies on statistical mechanics and simulations
              that have been used for the studies of glasses.

This theoretical approach
              will provide the basic understanding of the folding properties of protein.  
              This problem is currently at the frontier of protein research, and a basic
              understanding of the factors that influence protein folding could have an
              enormous impact on the biotechnology industry.
