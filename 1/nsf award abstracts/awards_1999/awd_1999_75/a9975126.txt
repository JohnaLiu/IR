Abstract    :
              This project is designed to improve our scientific understanding of residential
              segregation.  Indices of residential segregation are seen as key reflections of
              social reality, particularly the overall degree of social integration of
              groups, especially ethnic groups, in society.  The approach takes advantage of
              contemporary statistical methods and multi-level data to generate improved
              measures of segregation.  It also will update these measures to accommodate
              contemporary social reality.  Much of segregation methods remain limited to
              considering two groups, such as blacks and whites.  The newer measures will be
              able to summarize the residential patterns that exist for an ethnically diverse
              population, such as the contemporary United States.  These methodological
              advances also will allow us to adjust segregation measures for other aspects of
              population composition, something beyond the scope of traditional segregation
              measures.
