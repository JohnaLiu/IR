Abstract    :
              This ESH project will assess the role of tectonics in changing deep-water
              circulation patterns, using data and models for the Maastrichtian stage.  A
              series of possible climate scenarios will be run using the GCM GENESIS, the
              results of which will be used to force the ocean model MOM.  Runs of the ocean
              model will incorporate chemical tracers, and the results will be compared with
              geochemical data from global sediments.  The focus of the project is to assess
              the effect of subsidence of the South Atlantic Walvis/Rio Grande Ridge system
              upon deep water circulation.
