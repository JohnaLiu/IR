This award
              supports enhancement to the functionality, reliability and accessibility of the
              SimpleScalar tool suite of microprocessor simulation tools.  The tools will
              provide the computer architecture research community with access to accurate
              and validated tools and a shared code base to enable reproducibility of
              results.  Educational users will be able to integrate the tools into
              undergraduate and graduate curricula and provide students access to
              experimental systems research.
