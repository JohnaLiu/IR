Abstract    :
              Mark Hoffmann is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of the structures and
              unimolecular reactions of fluoro- and oxyfluoro- substituted dioxiranes,
              diazirines and phosphaazirines.    Hoffmann will perform ab initio theoretical
              calculations to characterize the relevant equilibrium structures of these
              compounds on the ground and low-lying excited state potential energy surfaces
              as well as to calculate a number of physical properties such as dipole moments,
              vibrational frequencies and electronic spectra.  Thermodynamic stabilities of
              various isomers, and possible channels for isomerization and unimolecular
              decomposition will also be studied.    Extensive use of dynamic electron
              correlation at relatively high levels and the use of extended polarized basis
              sets are necessary for the study of these compounds.  In addition, the location
              of minima and transition states for these species will be performed using the
              multi-reference configuration interaction with single and double excitation
              (MR-CISD) in conjunction with a newly realized incomplete model space
              multi-configuration self consistent field (MCSCF) program.  

The interest in
              these compounds arises from their use as powerful oxidants that may be
              effective as components of fuels, and the fact that some are precursors for
              radicals important in understanding stratospheric processes.
