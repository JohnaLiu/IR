This award supports research on transport properties of
              unconventional superconductors in the mixed state. The PI wants to continue
              work on superconductors that have order parameters of d-wave symmetry and to
              address fundamental open questions such as the thermal conductivity in the
              vortex state and the influence of induced superconducting phases.  Extensions
              to different experimental configurations and to higher temperatures will also
              be performed.  The PI plans to explore the interplay between nonlocal and
              nonlinear effects in the electromagnetic response.  Finally, the PI intends to
              investigate the microscopic nature of impurity scattering in unconventional
              superconductors and the interference of elastic and inelastic scattering.
              

This award supports research into the properties of high temperature and
              heavy fermion superconductors.  The PI seeks to understand transport properties
              of the novel superconducting states of these materials in applied magnetic
              fields that are sufficiently large so that vortices appear in the
              superconducting state.  Unlike most known superconductors, the Cooper pairs
              that comprise the superconducting states of these materials have d-wave
              symmetry which will can lead to new physical phenomena and qualitatively
              different transport properties.   In addition, this award provides educational
              opportunity for the next generation of scientists.
