ABSTRACT: 
              This project concerns the construction of a combinatorial model of geometry to
              be used in theoretical studies where differential forms and tensors appear
              inadequate or in practical work, where scientific computation is required.  We
              have discovered an operator "delta" in the cell structure of the space of
              closed curves in a manifold (string space), which records how finite
              collections of strings interact with themselves and with each other.  This
              operator induces a Lie bialgebra structure on the homology of the space of the
              locally embedded strings.  After developing the abstract theory behind these
              string interactions, we will build an explicit combinatorial model using any
              cell decomposition of the manifold.
	
The concrete model will be designed to
              implement nonlinear computations that arise in the motion of fluids, gases, or
              plasmas.  The motion of these media is closely related to the way curves in
              space twist and curl under the influence of physical forces.  Also, the
              interactions of the basic structure "delta" alluded to above, can be readily
              seen in such phenomena as the recoupling of vertex trails behind the wing tips
              of airplanes.  We have some optimism that some of our goals can be realized
              because the mathematical structure of closed curves seems very well adapted
              geometrically to many of the problems we care about on the one hand, and on the
              other hand once revealed this structure seems to flow forth rather willingly
              and with some pageantry and richness.
