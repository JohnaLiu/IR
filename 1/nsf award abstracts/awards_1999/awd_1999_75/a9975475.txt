Abstract    :
              This project will provide an X-ray camera and a germanium spectrometer to study
              MeV X-ray bursts at very high latitudes.  The instrument will be flown on a
              long-duration balloon flight that is being funded by NASA.  This is a reflight
              of an experiment that was originally flown in 1998.  The original experiment
              was funded in part by NASA and in part by NSF under grant ATM-9806400.  That
              experiment failed because of a failure of the balloon.  The original
              instruments were badly damaged or destroyed in the failure.  This project will
              refurbish and rebuild the necessary components for a new flight.  The flight
              duration is expected to be about two weeks.  The first detection of terrestrial
              X-ray bursts with energies extending up to the MeV range was made in 1996. 
              This experiment will be able to examine the temporal evolution of these high
              energy bursts, which will help elucidate the mechanism that produces the
              bursts.
