Abstract    :
              All vertebrates faced with noxious environmental stimuli (such as predators or
              storms) elicit a stress response culminating in release of glucocorticoid
              hormones.  Even though the stress response is vital to allow animals to
              successfully cope with predators and storms, 60 years of study have failed to
              adequately explain how glucocorticoids help wild animals survive.  This
              projects addresses this gap by building on work indicating that some wild birds
              seasonally alter glucocorticoid release.  Three important question arise from
              this research: Who does it? (Which species seasonally alter glucocorticoid
              response); How do they do it? (What are the mechanisms); and Why do they do it?
               This project will answer these questions with integrated laboratory and field
              studies using three wild avian species.  Field studies will monitor seasonal
              changes in glucocorticoid levels and explore the physiological changes required
              to alter glucocorticoid release.  Laboratory studies will create a model of
              seasonal glucocorticoid modulation and determine whether glucocorticoids
              interfere with normal seasonal physiological responses.  This project will
              further define how seasonal changes alter the underlying physiology of the
              stress response and what survival value these changes impart, and thus have a
              far reaching impact on our knowledge of the ecological validity of stress
              responses.
