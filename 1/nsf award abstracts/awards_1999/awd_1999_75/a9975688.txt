This award will provide partial support for the acquisition
              of an atomic force microscope.  It will be used for ongoing experiments aimed
              at determining structure-property relationships in organic materials.  The
              microscope is capable of a variety of imaging and measurement modes and will be
              used to probe (1) the electronic properties of well-defined nanostructures of
              organic semiconductors and (2) the mechanical strength of chemical bonds
              between individual molecules.  The results of these fundamental studies will
              contribute to molecular level understanding of charge transport and
              nanomechanical processes in organic materials, and have the potential to
              significantly impact efforts to use these materials in practical applications
              such as thin film electronics.

This instrument will also be used to educate
              many undergraduate and graduate students in scanning probe microscopy methods
              for materials research.
***
This instrument will significantly enhance the
              capability to characterize the mechanical and electronic properties of organic
              materials and will be used to train students.
