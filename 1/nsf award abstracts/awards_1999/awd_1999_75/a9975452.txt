Development of Membrane Materials Using Ion Beam Irradiation
              of Aromatic Polyimides

Ion-beam irradiation is being investigated as a
              method to modify systematically the gas-transport properties of polymeric
              membranes in order to develop membrane systems for applications in harsh
              environments. Numerous studies indicate that there is a significant evolution
              in the chemical structure and microstructure as well as in  the properties of
              polymers following exposure to irradiating ions at increasing ion fluences.  
              Proof-of-concept studies by this research group indicate that H+ irradiation of
              polyimide membranes results in combined increases in both permeability and
              permselectivity relative to the virgin membranes. A systematic investigation of
              the impact of ion-beam irradiation on the microstructure, chemical structure,
              and gas transport properties of a series of polyimides will be performed.   The
              results of this study will clarify the mechanism of microstructural evolution
              in the polyimides and the relationship between this microstructure and the
              gas-transport properties of the irradiated polymers.
