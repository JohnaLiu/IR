Theoretical research will be done on strongly correlated
              and disordered electronic systems at low temperatures, with the principal
              objective to understand the phase transitions and other collective phenomena in
              such systems.  An effective field theory developed under prior NSF support will
              be extended and applied in a systematic treatment of electronic systems with
              static impurities.  Specific systems of interest include magnets with
              impurities, superconductors, and doped.  The methodologies include the
              construction of effective field theories, renormalization group techniques, and
              many-perturbation theory. 

The problem of strongly interacting electron
              systems is a major one in modern condensed physics. Researchers have discovered
              over the past few years that such fundamental issues as magnetism in metals are
              not understood at a fundamental level and that existing theoretical methods are
              not sufficient to gain a deep understanding of problem. This grant will look at
              a number of problems related to the central one of strongly interacting
              electron systems and use, and develop, a variety of powerful mathematical
              techniques in order to do this.   The results of this project will be useful to
              other scientists concerned with the electrical and magnetic properties of
              matter.
