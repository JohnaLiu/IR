Abstract

Thermal analysis equipment is acquired and installed. 
              The equipment consists of a high-sensitivity thermal gravimetric analyzer, a
              quadrupole mass spectrometer with pumps, and a gas chromatograph with thermal
              conductivity and flame ionization detectors and gas sampling valve; these
              components can be used individually or in various combinations for flexible
              experimental arrangements.  The equipment is used in studies of the
              gasification of cellulosic and lignosic materials as related to hydrogen
              production or incineration, smoldering of polyurethane, catalytic combustion of
              natural gas, and reforming of hydrocarbons.
