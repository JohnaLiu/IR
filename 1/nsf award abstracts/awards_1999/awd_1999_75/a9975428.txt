Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Patrick Vaccaro of Yale University will study the
              unimolecular reaction dynamics of several small to medium-sized molecules using
              a variety of linear and nonlinear spectroscopic techniques.  Earlier work on
              unimolecular transformations in S2O and on intramolecular hydrogen bonding and
              proton transfer in malonaldehyde will be extended, the structure unimolecular
              transformations in the cyanogen family will be examined in detail, and
              transformations between isomers in the cyanogen family, CNNC, CNCN, and CNNC
              will be studied.  Experimental findings will be compared to calculations using
              new theoretical methods.  Various degenerate four-wave mixing (DFWM) techniques
              will be developed and quantified, including Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy
              (CRDS).  The proposed activities will advance the knowledge and the
              understanding of unimolecular dynamics and the interpretation of signals
              derived from linear and nonlinear optical measurements.  

The investigations
              undertaken in this project will help increase understanding of molecular
              behavior that plays a basic and important role in a variety of chemical and
              biological processes.  For example, the sequence of bond reorganization events
              that occur during chemical syntheses can be elucidated, allowing chemists to
              devise more efficient routes to a desired product.  The knowledge of structural
              preferences of molecules with bonds that can freely rotate impacts the
              understanding of protein folding in molecules of biological importance.
