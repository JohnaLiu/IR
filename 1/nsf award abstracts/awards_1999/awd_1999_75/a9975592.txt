This award will provide partial support for the acquisition
              of a rheometer.  It will be used in a multi-user facility to study the
              rheological properties of a variety of polymer solids, melts, and solutions,
              including:  (1) rheology studies of complex polymer mixtures such as polymer
              microemulsions, hydrogen-bonded polymer blends, and polysaccharide solutions;
              (2) the relationship between rheological properties and microscopic motion in
              polynorbornenes; and (3) dynamics of network- and glass-forming liquids. 
              

The rheometer will be an integral part of polymer education at Polytechnic
              University.  A rheology experiment will be added to the existing graduate
              Polymer Lab course.  Students will work on simple homopolymer melts to see the
              consequences of well-established phenomena such as entanglement and
              time-temperature superposition.  In addition, it will be used to demonstrate
              the rheology of more complex systems such as block copolymer melts in the
              graduate Solid State of Polymers course.
%%%
The rheometer will be dedicated
              for polymer research and educational activities in the Department(s) of
              Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, and Materials Science at Polytechnic
              University.
