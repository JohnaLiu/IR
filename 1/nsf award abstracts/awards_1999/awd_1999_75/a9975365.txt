Abstract    :
              DEB-9975365

This project will provide substantive summer research fellowships
              for students from Tribal Colleges at the University of Montana (UM) to provide
              training in environmental biology.  The project involves substantial
              collaborations between UM and Salish Kootenai College (SKC) in developing this
              training for students.  It will provide research experiences in one or more of
              21 labs working environmental biology including the Flathead Lake Biological
              Station.  It will develop a series of seminars in environmental biology that
              involve collaborations between UM and SKC. It will provide for extensive
              mentoring of undergraduate students by their peers, graduate students and
              faculty.  It will develop an invited speaker series bringing American Indian
              biologists from a broad region to interact with program participants.  The
              project will train students to be flexible thinkers and to work collaboratively
              to ask questions and solve problems in environmental biology.  It will increase
              the number of American Indian students pursuing training and careers in
              environmental biology.
