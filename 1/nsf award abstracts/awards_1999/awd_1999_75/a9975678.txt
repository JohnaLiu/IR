Abstract    :
              9975678
This award will provide partial support for the acquisition of a field
              emission scanning electron microscope with electron backscatter detector and
              energy dispersive X-ray analysis capability.  The instrument selected will
              provide a resolution of 3 nm at 1 kV and 1 nm at 20kV, almost an order of
              magnitude better than existing SEM instruments now available to these
              researchers. This instrument can be connected to remote computers via the
              Internet. This will allow collaborators and students at remote sites to
              participate in the examination of samples almost as if they were physically
              present. This feature will be of particular value in providing wider access to
              the instrument by students and faculty from historically under-represented
              groups at other institutions in Virginia. 

The new instrument will be housed
              in the Hancock Hall Microscopy Laboratory, a multi-user instrument facility
              being developed at Virginia Tech. This facility is operated as a university
              cost center that contains several varieties of microscopes, is professionally
              staffed, and is available on a fee basis to all members of the university
              community.  The new instrument will significantly augment the on-going research
              and education activities at VPI and other institutions.
&&&
The availability
              of this instrument will improve the research infrastructure at Virginia Tech,
              augment the effectiveness of many research groups on campus, and improve the
              training of future scientists and engineers.
