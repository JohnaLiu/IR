Abstract    :
              The University of Missouri-Columbia requests support from NSF to connect
              Conception Seminary College, a MOREnet higher education member to the Internet.
              This request will allow students, faculty, and staff in this rural locale to
              access computing and information technologies and resources of the Internet
              through the Missouri Research and Education Network (MOREnet). This
              infrastructure will be the first step toward establishing long distance
              learning applications, "smart classrooms", and a library with an on-line card
              catalog system utilized by students and the community in general. The award
              provides partial support of the project for two years.
