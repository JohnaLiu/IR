Abstract    :
              Reproduction is energetically costly and, in mammals, the cost is born entirely
              by mothers through gestation and lactation.  Maternal efforts increases with
              litter size, but at slow rate such that individual offspring in large litters
              receive a smaller percentage of available resources than offspring are tied to
              the level of maternal care, so there is a tradeoff between litter size and
              offspring quality.  Unfortunately, assessing this tradeoff is not simple
              because mothers may differ in their efficiency of producing offspring.  This
              study will manipulate the number of embryos and pups in northern grasshopper
              mice to examine the relationship between litter size and the energetic cost of
              lactation.  Energetic data will be used to test for individual optimization of
              litter size and to test the hypothesis that the modal litter size produces the
              largest offspring per unit effort.  Reproductive efficiency and costs will be
              determined in litters where the mother is rearing natural-sized litters, and in
              artificially larger and smaller litters.  The results of this project will
              provide foundation data on the energetic cost of lactation and the evolution of
              litter size and litter size variability
