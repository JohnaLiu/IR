Abstract    :
              Funds are provided to develop a fully automated computer program to calculate
              high-pressure phase equilibria of carbonate-bearing lithologies that will
              enable input complex bulk compositions representative of subducted lithologies
              at the subduction zones. Piston cylinder experimental studies of selected key
              equilibria will constrain the computations and reduce errors arising from
              uncertainties in thermochemical data and equations of state. This will enable
              the PIs to track carbon dioxide expulsion with progressive depth in subducted
              slabs and thus track the evolution of carbon dioxide in forearcs, subarcs and
              at depths beyond subarcs. Then study will contribute to the MARGINS program
              objectives by shedding light on how the volatiles are balanced across
              convergent margins and ultimately to the role of subduction in carbon-dioxide
              recycling and the global carbon cycle.
