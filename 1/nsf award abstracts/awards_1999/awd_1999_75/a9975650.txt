This award will provide partial support for the development
              of an automated system of high osmotic pressure chromatography (HOPC) for
              preparative separation of polymer by the molecular weight (MW) and copolymer by
              the chemical composition (CC).  Lack of methods to prepare well-defined polymer
              samples with a specific architecture as represented by MW and CC has been
              compromising rigorous understanding of structure-property relationship and
              improvement in design of polymer-based materials.  

This system will employ
              computer-controlled loading and injection of the concentrated polymer solution
              by two pumps.  A dynamic light scattering detector characterizes the MW
              distribution of the eluent in real time.  In the copolymer separation, a CCD
              array detector will be used alone or in tandem with the light scattering
              detector for real-time composition analysis.  The instrument will be shared
              among researchers at Polytechnic University.  The planned research projects
              include study of thermodynamics of separation at high concentrations,
              controlled biological processing of polymer synthesis, preparation of
              dimer-free protein crystals, study of competitive adsorption, and study of
              dynamics in blends of block copolymers and epoxy networks.  The HOPC system
              will also be used as a part of the graduate polymer laboratory course to
              educate students and to use the equipment for research.

This innovative
              system is expected to significantly impact research and education in polymer
              science and engineering.
