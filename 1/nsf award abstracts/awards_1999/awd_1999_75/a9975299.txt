There are over 220 Internet discussion lists devoted to
              language and linguistics, most of them carrying information valuable to
              academic linguists. However, much of this material is inaccessible to
              linguistic researchers, because of the instability of email lists and the
              unavailability of list archives. The LINGUIST List intends to establish a
              multi-list archive to preserve these discussion messages in searchable,
              web-readable form. The archive will also offer multi-list subscription services
              and message-posting capabilities. Furthermore, every hyperlink posted on an
              archived list will be automatically extracted and added to a searchable
              database. Thus the individual linguist will need to visit only a single, freely
              accessible site to retrieve information from multiple lists, join multiple
              discussions, and search a comprehensive but focused collection of hyperlinks
              relevant to linguistic research.
