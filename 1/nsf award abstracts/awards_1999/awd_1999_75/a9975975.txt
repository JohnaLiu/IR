This award will provide partial support for the
              acquisition of a new console and probes for an existing solid-state NMR
              spectrometer that is a part of the departmental shared Instrumentation
              Facility. In addition to improved reliability, the equipment includes digital
              filtering, high speed phase shifting, extreme digitization rates and offers
              significantly enhanced sensitivity and flexibility in experimental design and
              setup. The increased sensitivity will enable new
experiments, especially those
              that require rapid data acquisition or very small sample volumes.
The improved
              user interface translates into greater productivity, especially in an
              educational
environment.

UCLA has an outstanding track record integrating
              basic research with innovative undergraduate programs to enhance the
              educational experience of students and has been very successful in recruiting
              minority students to participate in research training.  The equipment will be
              fully utilized in the training of students.

This is an ideal equipment
              acquisition.  It will be employed to enhance the research and training
              experience of students.
