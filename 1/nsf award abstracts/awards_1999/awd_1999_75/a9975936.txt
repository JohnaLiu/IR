Abstract    :
              	Environmental stewardship is the theme for planning activities for a subsequent
              Large Collaborative Project.  Activities include:  1) identifying and bringing
              together formal and non-formal education agencies, relevant businesses, state
              environmental agencies, and citizen environmental groups, 2) establishing a
              network of Kansas State University (KSU) faculty, staff, and students committed
              to increasing the number of women participating in SMET programs, 3) testing
              the feasibility of an environmental theme in building a collaborative
              infrastructure supportive of women's increased participation in SMET at KSU,
              and 4) collecting baseline data on Kansas women's participation in SMET from
              grade 6 through graduate school that will be used in evaluation of planning and
              later activities.  This project will be conducted over the period of September
              1, 1999 to August 31, 2000.
