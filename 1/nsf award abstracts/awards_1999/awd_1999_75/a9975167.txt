Abstract    :
              	The purpose of  this research is to examine how social structure affects
              individual political participation.  I propose to conduct survey research that
              examines how social interaction affects individual political activity in
              electoral campaigns.  The survey design is a cross-sectional study in St.
              Louis, Missouri that gathers information on the extent to which people's social
              relationships expose them to information, requests to be active in politics,
              and civic skills that can lead to political activity.
	The primary goal of
              this research is to add to our understanding of why people participate in
              American electoral politics.  As a result, my design incorporates a component
              which administers the survey questionanire to the political discussants of
              activists.  This design feature allows us to track the flow of information,
              skills, and requests for participation through the social structure.
