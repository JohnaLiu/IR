Abstract    :
              
DEB-9975287

The high levels of endemism in the insular Pacific create a
              situation where environmental concerns are of critical importance.  Despite
              these concerns, environmental biology is not often considered as a viable
              career option by Pacific Island peoples.  This project would develop an
              undergraduate program in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology to
              increase the participation of students in these areas throughout the Pacific. 
              It will develop a primary collaboration among three primary academic
              institution:  the two main campuses of the University of Hawaii (UH), in Manoa
              and Hilo, and the University of Guam.  This project will foster environmental
              training by coordination with two existing environmental resource management
              programs:  The UH Hawaiian Internship Program and the Micronesia and America
              Samoa Student Internship Program.  Students will be recruited throughout the
              Pacific.  They will be able to interact from widespread institutions using a
              sophisticated distance learning technology available at UH.  This project will
              greatly increase the number of Pacific Island people pursuing advanced training
              in environmental biology.
