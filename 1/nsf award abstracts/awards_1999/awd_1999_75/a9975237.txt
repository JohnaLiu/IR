Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to encourage the expansion of systematic
              comparative analyses of courts, judges and their behavior based on replicable
              data. This project will eventuate in a multi-country data base that will (1)
              focus on the top courts from a manageable most different systems sample of
              nations, (2) select annual samples of their formal or reported decisions over a
              half century, (3) code the manifest content of the opinions accompanying the
              sampled decisions according to a master codebook, measure a set of common
              variables that are relevant to various analytical interests and that can be
              equivalently measured across all included nations, and (4) supplement the
              common variables by coding a set of system-specific variables that might not be
              measured across all nations.

These data will be created and archived for
              public use. However, the P.I.s also will use them to analyze an important set
              of initial research questions, including (1) do these and other courts
              regularly decide cases with apparently important policy consequences, or do
              most of them spend most of their time resolving legal disputes of only narrow
              policy significance?, (2) Do "the haves in fact always come out ahead"? (3) Do
              judicial independence, functional performance, and support of incumbent regimes
              by national courts vary with political transitions, proclaimed national crises
              or with executive appointments of sympathetic judges?
