Abstract    :
              9975615
This award will provide partial support for the acquisition of a
              versatile ultrafast optical laser system that is centered around two
              broadly-tunable high-pulse-energy femtosecond optical parametric amplifiers
              (OPA) with nonlinear harmonic generation, pumped by a fsec Ti:Sapphire laser
              and regenerative laser amplifier. This system will be a unique and open
              research and student training facility on the Purdue University Campus. The
              broadly interdisciplinary group of researchers from across the Purdue Campus
              will use the facility for advanced research on semiconductor, metal and
              biomaterials. The research facility will be closely integrated with Purdue
              University teaching goals at the undergraduate and graduate student level to
              give students broad exposure to advanced technology to prepare them for diverse
              careers in science and engineering.

This equipment will significantly
              enhance the research and educational capability and infrastructure of the
              institution, its students, and its faculty.
