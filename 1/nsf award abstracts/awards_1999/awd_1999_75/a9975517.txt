Abstract    :
              

This proposal seeks funding to build a high energy, cavity dumped laser
              system using EO modulators.  The work is an extension of previous
              accomplishment by the PI under a NSF CAREER award (PHY-9502935).  The PI has
              demonstrated an EO cavity-dumped laser system that has produced 200nJ of energy
              in 20 fsec at 1 KHz repetition rate, which is twice the energy of the
              state-of-the-art acuosto-optic (AO) cavity-dumped laser system.  The advantage
              of the EO cavity-dumping over that of AO is that the latter suffers instability
              at high powers due to the nonlinear process of the AO crystal.  The PI
              predicted that the theoretical maximum energy of an EO cavity dumped laser
              system is still 50 times what has been demonstrated, and that a repetition rate
              as high as 10 MHz is possible.  This proposal is to improve the original design
              and to achieve even higher energy of the laser system than he has
              demonstrated.
