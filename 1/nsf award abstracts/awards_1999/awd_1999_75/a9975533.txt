This award supports theoretical research on the crumpling of
              materials.  The PI seeks to extend previous work that found a simple
              mathematical description of the individual ridges that make up a crumpled
              sheet. Further work is aimed at finding mathematical relations that determine
              when and how the ridges will buckle.  The crumpling of materials down to
              smaller and smaller volumes will be investigated with the aim of finding
              characteristic features of the process that are universal.  The PI will also
              investigate the packing of granular materials (e.g. sandpiles). Using numerical
              simulations of perfectly hard, small frictionless spheres, the PI will study
              the microscopic motion of the grains that occurs in response to small
              disturbances.  The smallest disturbances that lead to microscopic motion will
              be sought in an effort to understand how grains move and how forces
              redistribute under disturbances that lead to settling.  

This award supports
              theoretical research on how materials, like paper, crumble and how grains move
              as granular materials (for example, grains of sand in sandpiles) settle or
              respond to some disturbance. The PI will use sophisticated mathematical
              techniques and computer simulations to gain insight into crumpling and granular
              motion. These processes are important to the understanding of materials and are
              ubiquitous in our everyday experience. Students and the next generation of
              researchers will receive high quality educational experiences as the research
              progresses.
