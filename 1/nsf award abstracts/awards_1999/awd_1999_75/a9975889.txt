Abstract    :
              This award is made under the high performance connections portion of ANIR's
              "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 98-102. It provides partial
              support for two years for an OC-3 connection. Applications involve data mining,
              active networking, high-power semiconductor device modeling, dynamic
              visualization of geophysical flows, lightning-induced phenomena and nuclear
              safety and more.  Collaborating institutions include but are not limited to the
              U.S. Army, NASA, Sandia National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, AT&T
              Research; Lucent Technologies, Thiokol Corporation, Rutgers University,
              Princeton University, and Cornell University.
