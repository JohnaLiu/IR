Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

This work will test the hypothesis that the coastal margin contains
              transition zones enriched in labile organic carbon and that these zones can
              markedly affect groundwater nitrogen dynamics in coastal aquifers. The study
              would focus on three coastal settings in the salt ponds of Rhode Island to
              examine how temporal and spatial processes affect nitrogen and carbon cycling,
              groundwater nitrogen removal rates and N20 efflux at the coastal margin. The
              studies would be done in-situ with minimum disturbance to soil structure.  The
              work will endeavor to increase our understanding of the structure and function
              of the coastal margin and provide information on groundwater nutrient dynamics
              essential to water quality management in the coastal zone.

This proposal was
              submitted in response to the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry
              solicitation NSF 99-9, and is being funded by the Division of Ocean Science,
              Earth Sciences, and Chemistry.
