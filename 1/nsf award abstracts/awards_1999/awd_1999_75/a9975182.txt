Abstract    :
              9975182
This award will provide partial support for the development of an
              ultrahigh-resolution photoelectron analyzer system for angle-resolved
              photoemission studies of basic physical effects and phenomena related to
              quantum structures. A new undulator beamline at the Synchrotron Radiation
              Center (SRC) is under construction, and is scheduled to begin operation in
              early 1999. This beamline, coupled to a state-of-the-art Normal Incidence
              Monochromator, will deliver a flux up to 5x10 12 photons per second at a
              resolving power of 10,000 at 20 eV (corresponding to an energy resolution of 2
              meV, and better at lower energies). This represents orders of magnitude
              improvement over the systems currently in use at SRC, and will offer
              opportunities for detailed studies of the electronic properties of solids,
              surfaces, adsorbates, quantum wells, and thin film systems. The PI and co-PI
              are members of this beamline's development team. 

This grant will provide
              funds for a state-of-the-art analyzer system equipped with a two-dimensional
              position-sensitive detector designed for simultaneous collection of energy and
              angle dependent data at high resolution (<3 meV and 0.2 degrees). This will
              enable the examination of quasiparticle lineshapes at precisely specified
              points in k space and at energies very close to the Fermi level in various
              metals, and thus to clarify basic issues related to the Fermi liquid behavior
              and electron correlation effects.

Many students, postdocs, and scientists
              from other institutions will use the instrument.  Training of students and
              postdocs will include the use of synchrotron radiation, a state-of-the-art
              analyzer, a two dimensional detector system, and related materials preparation
              and characterization techniques.

&&&
The system to be developed will
              significantly enhance the capability to investigate basic photoemission
              phenomena and quantum mechanical effects in many materials, and train a large
              number of students for careers in many sectors of the workforce.
