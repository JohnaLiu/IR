Abstract    :
              This study explores the dialect of children and adults in a rural community in
              northern Vermont.  This community and the study include both European-Americans
              and Abenakis -- a Native American indigenous group.  The speakers, aged two
              through adulthood, will be interviewed and tape recorded, and both the content
              of the speakers' interviews and the features of their dialects will be used to
              examine the following questions:

1. How do children acquire their dialects? 
              How does their speech resemble and not resemble that of their parents and
              peers?  How does the dialect-learning process of the children, in turn, affect
              the dialect of the speech community as a whole?

2. Are there differences
              among the speakers in the dialect features they use?  If so, can this variation
              be related to social factors present in the community, such as gender, age,
              ethnicity, and attitude about and level of involvement in the community or in
              rural life?

3. How do the dialect features found in northern Vermont
              speakers today compare with those reported in the literature 60 years ago
              (Kurath 1939-1943)?  Are any changes that may be found indicative of possible
              dialect death?
