This three-year award supports US-UK collaborative research
              in polymer science between Russell Composto of the University of Pennsylvania
              and Richard A.L. Jones of the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom. 
              The investigators will study the thermodynamic and kinetic principles
              underlying polymer interfacial phenomena at the molecular level and in
              multi-phase systems.  Complementary techniques of low-energy forward recoil
              spectrometry and neutron reflectivity will be used to measure interfacial
              excess of small molecules, and the effect of small molecule composition, chain
              length and polarity on interfacial properties.  

Polymer interfaces play a
              critical role in technologically important areas including food packaging,
              protective coatings, adhesives, and biocompatibility.  The proposed research
              will advance understanding for optimizing the surface, interface and bulk
              properties of multi-phase thin film polymer blends.  The US investigator brings
              to this collaboration expertise in low-energy forward recoil spectrometry. 
              This is complemented by British expertise in neutron reflectivity.  The project
              takes advantage of unique, real time, neutron sources currently availability in
              the United Kingdom (Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory) and in Grenoble, France.
