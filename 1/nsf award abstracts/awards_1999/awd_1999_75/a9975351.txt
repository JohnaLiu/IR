Abstract    :
              Queller and Strassmann will study cooperation and conflict Polistes dominulus, a
              social wasp that is unusual because its colonies include both close relatives
              and non-relatives.  They will study the degree to which kinship, determined by
              DNA fingerprinting methods, influences aggression, reproductive sharing, and
              altruistic helping behavior.   They will also study how this unusual genetic
              structure influences the rules of queen succession and whether the power to
              determine the new queen lie with a
single strong individual or with the more
              numerous workers.

	This study continues the successful tradition of using
              social insects as model systems for understanding how living things come to be
              organized into cooperative entities.  Kinship is one of the most important
              correlates of cooperative behavior.  Yet there have been few systems where the
              behavior of both relatives and non-relatives could be compared within the same
              colony, so P. dominulus provides a unique opportunity for critical tests.  The
              strong conflict over queen succession will allow Queller and Strassmann to
              study how such conflicts are resolved in cooperative groups.   Finally, because
              P. dominulus is a non-native pest species in the U. S., knowledge of its
              behavior may be useful ultimately in preserving native biodiversity.
