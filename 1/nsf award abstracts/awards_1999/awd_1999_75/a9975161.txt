Abstract    :
              The ESH project will collect a series of 50-m cores drilled along the Rio
              Desaguadero of the Bolivian Altiplano to identify changing lake levels over the
              last 50,000 years.  Lake levels reflect regional precipitation and can be used
              as indicators of the South American tropical moisture balance.  Radiocarbon and
              Ar/Ar dating will constrain ages and sedimentology will be used to assess
              depositional environment and shoreline extent.
