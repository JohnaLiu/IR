DLI-International: Cross-Domain Resource Discovery: Integrated
              Discovery and Use of Textual, Numeric, and Spatial Data

This is the first
              year funding of a three year continuing award.  This project is a collaboration
              between the University of California, Berkeley and Special Collections and
              Archives , the University of Liverpool Library.  The goal is to advance
              cross-domain searching capabilities in a multi-database environment. The effort
              is intended to result in  a next generation online information retrieval system
               based on international standards that will facilitate searching on the
              Internet across collections of original materials, printed books, records,
              archives, manuscripts, and museum objects, statistical databases, full-text,
              geo-spatial, and multi-media data resources.
