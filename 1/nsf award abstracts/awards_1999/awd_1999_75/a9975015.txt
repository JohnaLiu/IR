              Generation Software:  Logistical QoS through Application-driven Scheduling of
              Remote Storage

The research in the proposed project (Logistical Computing
              and Internetworking  - LoCI) is aimed at developing middleware that can provide
              reliable, flexible, scalable and cost-effective delivery of data with quality
              of service.

The proposal aims to develop new approaches to enable these
              capabilities, among which is the proposed logistical QoS, to provide much more
              flexible control of message buffering without requiring difficult end-to-end
              guarantee requirements.  This can be accomplished by developing techniques like
              data staging, by moving data in advance and storing them close to the receiver,
              and the proposed project will investigate such notions of the logistical
              network computing.

The proposal will develop such  approaches and techniques
              and use existing tools and protocols to implement and test these ideas, such as
              the Internet Backplane Protocol, the Network Weather Service, NetSolve, and the
              Application Level Scheduling systems that the PI and his co-PI's have developed
              over the years. The effort will result in middleware support more readily
              exploited by the applications.
