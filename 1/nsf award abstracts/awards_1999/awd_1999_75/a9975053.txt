Next Generation
              Software: TMO Based modeling and Design of Reliable Next-Generation Complex
              Software.

The Time-triggered Message-triggered Object (TMO) structuring
              scheme that has been formulated by the PI's in recent years is intended to
              facilitate component based real-time distributed software engineering in a form
              which software engineers in the vast business software field can adapt to, with
              small efforts.  It is a syntactically simple and natural extension, but
              semantically powerful extension of the conventional object structuring
              approaches.

In the proposed research,  the PI's intend to render the
              TMO-based RT distributed computing application software engineering methodology
              in a more versatile form and validate the effectiveness of the methodology in
              real application environments, via a systematic university-industry
              collaborative experimental study.

Among the milestones in the project
              include establishing: 
Formalized TMO-structured modeling techniques for
              hierarchical multi-level specification, design and          analysis of complex
              distributed systems
C++ and Java based tools for TMO-structured RT and
              distributed programming and expression of high level    
              abstractions
Middleware models of commercial level RT OS systems
Techniques
              and tools for analysis and timeliness-guarantees of TMO component based
              software systems
Techniques for dynamic optimization of mobile software
              components
Techniques and tools for visualization of real-time
              simulations
Demonstration and validation of all the techniques and tools
              developed in the project.
