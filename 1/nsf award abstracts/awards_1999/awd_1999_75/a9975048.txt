Abstract    :
              This proposal is a project to measure and model looming responses of cells
in
              the optic ganglia (primarily the lobula) of the night-flying hawk
              moth,
Manduca sexta. When the moth hovers in front of a flower to feed,
              wind
causes the flower to move in the moth's visual field. The
              experiments
proposed are of two kinds: First, responses to a wide variety of
              visual
stimuli will be recorded intracellularly as well as extracellularly
              from
looming neurons in order to test if the trigger for the looming
              responses
are stimulus changes of luminance, changes of perimeter, or changes
              due to
visual flow fields. Second, computer models of these neuronal
              responses
will be constructed and tested with equivalent 'stimuli'. It is
              planned to
test the models with real images by feeding into the models videos
              of e.g.
foliage or flowers wiggling in the wind. One very practical future use
              of
such computer models may be in machine (robot) vision and in
              neuromorphic
chips.
