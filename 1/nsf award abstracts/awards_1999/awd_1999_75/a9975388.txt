This is a travel grant to allow scientists to attend the
              Conference and Winter School: "Topological Defects and Non-Equilibrium Dynamics
              of Symmetry-Breaking Phase Transitions". The Conference will be held in Les
              Houches, France, February 16-26. This is an unusual conference which brings
              together cosmologists and condensed matter physicists. The common ground
              between these normally distinct disciplines is research of the supported
              participants involving topological defects in superfluid Helium-3 and Helium-4.
              The theoretical description and experimental study of these helium defects has
              been found to have applications in cosmology.
