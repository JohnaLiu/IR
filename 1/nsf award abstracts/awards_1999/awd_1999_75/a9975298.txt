Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a conference to be held June 27-July 2, 1999
              at the Gulf State Park Resort Hotel and Convention Center, Gulf Shores,
              Alabama.  The purpose of the conference is to bring together researchers
              interested in separation techniques involving aqueous two phase systems.  There
              are many techniques in this area that are potentially suitable for use in
              environmentally benign separations technology, but as the PI states these are
              often developed in isolation.  There is a need for conferences like this to
              help integrate research and promote the cross fertilization of ideas for
              advancing strategic aspects of the field concerned with environmentally benign
              chemical processing.
