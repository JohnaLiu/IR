This award will provide partial support for the acquisition
              of a state-of-the-art system for temporally- and spatially-resolved optical
              spectroscopy.  This system will involve two main components:  (1)  A
              Femtosecond Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) systems which is broadly tunable
              from 240 nm to 2.7 microns, and (2) a low-temperature scanned probe (CryoSXM)
              microscope with drive electronics.  This system will achieve both ultrafast
              (<200 fs) time-resolution and sub-micron (<100 to 500 nm) spatial resolution. 
              

This instrument will be used to study directly the nature of the electronic
              states of excitons confined to self-assembled CdSe quantum dots (SAQDs). 
              Recent experiment by our groups and others in Germany and Japan have suggested
              strongly that the structure of the CdSe dots and their electronic excitations
              are significantly different than observed in the prototypical InAs/GaAs quantum
              dots.  Such differences are not unexpected as II-VI materials as a group are
              more polar, with larger excitonic effects, more prominent electron-phonon
              interactions, and the valence band offsets are significantly smaller than for
              the III-V materials.

Research to be undertaken includes:

(i) Nano-scale
              mapping of the CdSe dots;
(ii) Time-resolved Photoluminescence Excitation
              (PLE); 
(iii) Magneto-Photoluminescence of Single Quantum Dots; 
(iv)
              Time-resolved Transport Measurements; and 
(v) Exciton Spin-Relaxation of
              Single Quantum Dots.

Acess to this state-of-the-art equipment will also
              provide significant new training opportunities for undergraduate students
              participating in these areas.

This equipment will provide the investigators
              with significantly increased capabilities to investigate the properties of self
              assembled quantum dots, and train students in a very important area of
              materials research and technology.
