Abstract    :
              This award is for a testing operation for the GLAD800 drilling system, to be
              performed in Bear Lake and the Great Salt Lake, Utah. The project will be a
              collaboration among the University of Minnesota, the University of Arizona, and
              DOSECC, Inc. (Drilling Observation, and Sampling of the Earth's Continental
              Crust). The GLAD800 system is specifically designed to meet the needs of the
              terrestrial paleoclimate community by performing drilling operations on large
              lakes in order to obtain sediment cores that provide an archive of continental
              climate. The capital costs of the drilling system are being provided by the
              International Continental Drilling Program, and this award is for the testing
              of the system, to be accomplished by drilling and obtaining cores in Bear Lake
              and Great Salt Lake.
