Abstract    :
              Centromeres are long stretches of DNA that, along with a set of proteins known
              as kinetochore proteins, are responsible for ensuring that chromosomes are
              accurately segregated and passed on to the next generation. Previous work has
              demonstrated that centromeres are composed primarily of repeated DNA sequences.
               Not all of the repeats are required because large sections of a centromere can
              be removed without affecting chromosome segregation. Research carried out under
              this award is designed to identify which of the DNA sequences in the maize
              centromere are directly responsible for chromosome segregation.  Towards this
              end, a sample of ~400,000 base pairs of centromeric DNA will be sequenced to
              determine the basic organization of the centromere. Each unique class of DNA
              sequence (either repetitive or single-copy) will be analyzed with respect to
              its distribution among the ten maize chromosomes and its interaction with a
              maize kinetochore protein. Based on these data, artificial centromeres will be
              created from selected portions of natural centromeres to test their activity in
              transgenic maize plants. In the final stages of the project, artificial
              centromeres will be used to create fully autonomous artificial chromosomes.
              Such artificial chromosomes could be used as vehicles for carrying
              agronomically important genes and could greatly improve existing methods for
              transferring genes into plants.
