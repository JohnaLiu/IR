Abstract    :
              The vestibular system uses organs of the inner ear called the semicircular
              canals and the otolith organs to detect gravity and movements of the head.  It
              is a system with extensive influence on eye movement, head position, and
              control of locomotion and posture.   This international conference brings
              together active researchers in this field to discuss recent results and their
              implications from biological, biomedical and bioengineering perspectives. 
              Emphasis in this conference will be on the interactions of vestibular input
              with visual, auditory and other sensory modalities, and on the integrated
              behavior of spatial orientation in animals and humans.
   The meeting will
              have an impact on the participating students and young investigators by
              involving them with other researchers at the leading edge of the field, and
              will have an impact on other areas of neuroscience and physiology by the
              integrated perspective.
