Grid Application Development
              Software (GrADS)

This proposal will make it possible to have advances in
              networking technologies to use the global information infrastructure in a
              qualitatively different way-as a computational resource as well as and
              information resource.  This idea for an integrated computation and information
              resource called the Computational Power Grid has been described by the recent
              book entitled The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure [40].  The
              Grid will connect the nation's computers, databases, instruments, and people in
              a seamless web, supporting emerging computation-rich application concepts such
              as remote computing, distributed supercomputing, tele-immersion, smart
              instruments, and data-mining.

To realize this vision, significant scientific
              and technical obstacles must be overcome.  Principal among these is usability. 
              Because the Grid will be inherently more complex than existing computer
              systems, programs that execute on the Grid will reflect some of this
              complexity.  The Grid resources will be useful and accessible to scientist and
              engineers requiring new software tools that embody major advances in both the
              theory and practice of building Grid applications.

The goal of the Grid
              Application Development Software (GrADS) Project is to simply distribute
              heterogeneous computing in the same way that the World Wide Web simplified
              information sharing over the Internet.  The GrADS projects will explore the
              scientific and technical problems that must be solved to make Grid application
              development and performance tuning for real applications an everyday practice.
