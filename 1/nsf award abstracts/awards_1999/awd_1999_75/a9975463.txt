The Baltimore Collaborative in Environmental Biology
              (BCEB), consisting of researchers from Towson University (TU), Morgan State
              University (MSU) and the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long Term Ecological
              Research (BES-LTER) project, will provide TU and MSU undergraduate students,
              many from underrepresented minority groups, with research opportunities in
              environmental biology by engaging them in BES's effort to develop a new,
              integrated understanding of urban ecology. Students will: 1) learn research
              techniques used in environmental biology, 2) develop and carry out an
              independent research project, 3) present results orally and in writing, 4)
              participate in research seminars, short courses, and project meetings, 5)
              contribute to peer support and review, and 6) become a contributing part of the
              effort to understand the Baltimore metropolitan area as an ecological system.
              

BCEB will provide exposure to environmental biology research to three
              cohorts of undergraduate students from TU and MSU, urban institutions with a
              substantial number of minority biology students from the Baltimore metropolitan
              area. Students will discover how environmental biology has direct relevance to
              their own lives and to the health and well being of their local communities,
              learn about career paths in environmental biology, and receive the guidance and
              skills needed to pursue the career of their choice.
