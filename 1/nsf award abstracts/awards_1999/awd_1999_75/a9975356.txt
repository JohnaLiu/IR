In this project, a plan is outlined to continue the efforts of
              the Student Meeting Activities Subcommittee of the Power Engineering Education
              Committee of the IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) to promote student
              interest in the power engineering field by sponsoring electrical engineering
              students from US universities to attend the IEEE PES annual Summer Meeting to
              be held in Edmonton, Alberta.  The goal of this project is to provide an
              opportunity for students to be exposed to the most recent developments in
              operation, construction, and research in the power engineering field.  This is
              a particularly critical time for power engineering as the industry undergoes
              significant change due to the restructuring of the traditional utility
              structure.  The career opportunities for students interested in power
              engineering are many and varied; the program offers student several
              opportunities to interact with practicing engineers from utilities, vendors,
              manufacturers, and consulting firms.
