Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Long Island University will
              acquire a fluorescence spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
              number of areas, including molecular recognition studies and low temperature
              deposition of thin films to produce electroluminescent displays. 

The
              fluorescence spectrometer counts photons of light in the UV and visible
              regions.  When a sample of material is illuminated by UV light, the visible
              light generated as a result of the fluorescence process can be monitored by the
              extremely sensitive fluorescence spectrometer.  Subsequent analysis provides
              precise information on the electronic structure of the fluorescing material.
