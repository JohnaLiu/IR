Abstract    :
              	Citizens are rarely, if ever, dispassionate when thinking about politics. 
              Rather than treating information about political parties, candidates, or issues
              evenhandedly, as normative models of rational decisionmaking prescribe, they
              are prone to accept those facts and arguments they agree with and discount or
              actively counter argue those which challenge their preconvictions.  In short,
              citizens often are "partisan" in their political beliefs, motivated more by
              their desire to maintain prior beliefs than by their desire to make "accurate"
              or otherwise optimal decisions.  More telling, even when people try hard to be
              faithful to the evidence, they often are  unable to treat information
              evenhandedly, for affect and cognition are linked inseparably in cognitive
              architecture and information processes.  Cognition is "hot" - affect becomes
              information in the decisionmaking calculus.  This grant proposal suggests a
              series of experimental and computational tests of the theory of motivated
              political reasoning as applied to the evaluation of candidates and issues.
