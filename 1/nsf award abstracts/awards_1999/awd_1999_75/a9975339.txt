The Costa Rican segment of the Central American volcanic arc is a
              superb natural laboratory to investigate processes related to arc magmatism. 
              The chain of active stratovolcanoes in Costa Rica is the latest "snapshot" in a
              prolonged history of arc volcanism that dates back to at least the early
              Miocene.  One of the main limitations to understanding the subduction factory
              in Costa Rica is the fact that pre-Holocene arc history is poorly known.  We
              propose to conduct detailed geologic mapping and a comprehensive 40Ar/39Ar
              geochronological investigation of Miocene to Pleistocene volcanic sections from
              throughout Costa Rica with the goal of better establishing the
              space-time-composition-volume patterns of arc volcanism.  The sort of questions
              and problems that such a database will help address include: Where was the
              active arc at various time in the past?  What are the time-volume-composition
              relationships for Costa Rican volcanism?  What is the nature of the plutonic
              roots to the Costa Rican arc and how do intrusive volumes and compositions
              compare to coeval volcanic rocks?  This data base will shed important new light
              on how continental volcanic arcs evolve and on the relationships between
              various subduction parameters (convergence rate, age of slab, sediment flux)
              and output products (magma volumes and chemistry) in arc environments.
