Abstract    :
              With support from the National Science Foundation's Innovation and
              Organizational Change Program, this study examines whether the implementation
              of "high performance" workplace practices ensure better firm performance.   It
              is based on the Educational Quality of the Workforce National Employers Survey
              (EQW-NES), a new database from a nationally representative sample of businesses
              from 1993-1996 that provides cross section and longitudinal information on
              workplace practices such as total quality management systems, benchmarking,
              reengineering, the diffusion of computer usage among non-managerial employees,
              recruiting strategies, the use of profit sharing and the extent of employee
              participation in decision making. Combined with wage and human capital
              information on employees, the study matches data from the survey with other
              characteristics of the business such as its age, its exporting activities,
              whether or not it is unionized, employee turnover, the age of the capital
              stock, gender and race composition of the workforce, and the capital intensity
              and performance of the business.

The study looks at the impact on labor
              productivity of worker characteristics (gender, race and turnover), educational
              background of the workforce and hiring and training practices.  These are
              analyzed along with establishment characteristics (age of capital stock and
              technology) and innovations in workplace practices such as profit sharing,
              teamwork, employee involvement in decision making. 

The findings will
              increase our understanding of the impacts of high performance workplace
              practices on better firm performance and of the educational characteristics of
              the workforce that underlie high performance.
