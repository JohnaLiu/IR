The scientific and popular media have recently
              reported on alarming declines and disappearances of amphibians in the United
              States and around the world. Because many affected sites are in designated
              "protected areas", scientists fear that amphibians are being affected by
              climate change, emerging diseases, or pesticide drift. Latin America, where
              frog and toad diversity is especially high, has experienced dramatic amphibian
              population declines and extinctions. This project will fund three workshops to
              bring US and Latin American scientists together to define a strategy to address
              the problem. A major goal is to develop a standardized methodology for
              assessing the status of amphibians throughout Latin America. In addition, a
              database accessible via the World Wide Web will be created to make the
              monitoring results readily available to the world's scientists and interested
              lay people.

The causes of amphibian population declines in both the US and
              Latin America are likely to be similar. Indeed, a fungal parasite first
              identified in Panamanian frogs has subsequently been discovered in frogs in the
              US. A backbone for monitoring activities will be some of the 61 protected areas
              in Latin America currently supported by The Nature Conservancy, an
              international land and water conservation organization, and the US Agency for
              International Development.
