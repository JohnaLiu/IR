This project at North Carolina State University continues
              development of virtual reality (VR) tools for engineering education that allow
              students to interact tactily and visually with an educational computer model. 
              The hardware for each VR station is composed of a force-feedback haptic and
              PC-based visualization.  The haptic is essentially a three-dimensional
              hand-held joystick in which mechanical linkages are used to control the motion
              of the haptic arm.  This control can be in the form of a push or pull, or a
              resistance to motion.  During the first funding period, five education software
              modules that include interatomic forces, stress-strain, diffusion and surface
              dynamics of vapor deposition have been developed.  In the continuation phase,
              these modules will be refined to eliminate chatter and to include stereo
              visualization capabilities, and new modules illustrating atomistic concepts
              related to mechanical properties of materials (creep, fatigue) and modules
              built around atomic-force microscopy images will be developed.

Simultaneous
              tactile and visual interaction with modules designed to illustrate concepts in
              materials engineering allows students to gain "hands-on" experience with
              otherwise seemingly abstract topics such as interatomic forces and diffusion
              barriers.  This capability has proven especially important for engineering
              students that relate to practical applications rather than abstract concepts. 
              Students working on this project have written modules illustrating interatomic
              bonding, stress-strain behavior, and diffusion processes that take advantage of
              this hardware.
