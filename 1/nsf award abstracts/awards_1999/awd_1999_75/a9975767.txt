This instrumentation will enable researchers at Northeastern
              University to study the physics, chemistry, and biology of new materials.  The
              14 T cryogen-free superconducting magnet will be used in fundamental studies of
              correlated electron effects, magnetism, and superconductivity in
              low-dimensional materials; metalloproteins; materials synthesis and processing
              of magnetic semiconductors and superconductors; and materials science
              education.  The requested magnet will be used for experiments below 14 T, while
              higher field experiments will be carried out at the NHMFL.

Research
              activities which require the high field magnet include:  (I) characterization
              of molecular beam epitaxy grown ferromagnetic semiconductor structures; (II)
              magnetic field quenching of metallic 2 dimensional electronic state; (III)
              electrodynamic studies of magnetic and superconductor materials; (IV) optical
              studies of correlated 2 dimensional systems in high magnetic fields; (V)
              biaxially textured superconducting films using magnetic fields; and (VI)
              high-field electron spin resonance studies of metalloproteins and biological
              systems.

Advanced graduate students and postdocs will do the majority of the
              work.  As part of their education and training, they will be primary authors in
              archival publications, attend scientific meetings to present research results
              and interact with the scientific community.  Undergraduate students will carry
              out smaller projects.  Some of these will be done while working full-time for
              half-year periods in Northeastern's Co-op Program.

This equipment will
              enable cutting-edge research to be advances, and provide invaluable training
              for students at all levels.
