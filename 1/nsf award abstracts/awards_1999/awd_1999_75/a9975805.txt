This award will provide partial support for a new scanning
              electron microscope to be housed in the Materials Characterization Laboratory
              of Stony Brook's Department of Materials Science and Engineering.  The
              instrument will provide new capabilities in the area of electron backscatter
              pattern analysis, facilitating a broad range of studies of triple junctions in
              thin films and bulk materials, in addition to studies of texture and other
              related effects in materials.  The instrument is also to be used to develop and
              apply novel techniques for the observation of sub-surface cracks in insulating
              coatings on conductive substrates.

A wide range of other materials research
              projects will be enhanced by this acquisition:  14 Stony Brook faculty members
              will constitute the primary user-base of the instrument.  A wide range of
              educational programs will also be enhanced by the new instrument.

The
              microscope will provide significantly improved service to general users from
              the Stony Brook campus and the Long Island region, and enrich the educational
              experience of students.
