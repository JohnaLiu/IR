Abstract    :
              This research project further explores the chemistry of vicinal tricarbonyl
              compounds and their use in synthetic organic chemistry.  One aspect of this
              work involves the application of these tricarbonyls as key electrophilic units
              in bond-forming reactions, leading to products of timely biological interest. 
              In addition, the chemistry of diacyl nitriles will be studied as novel
              substrates providing a new body of synthetic methodology applicable to the
              synthesis of bioactive linear and cyclic peptides.

With this award, the
              Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support of the
              research being conducted by Professor Harry H. Wasserman of Yale University. 
              Professor Wasserman has devised a functional group triad of extraordinary
              reactivity, and has studied ways to harness its potential for the preparation
              of complex molecules such as those found in nature.  Many of these complex
              natural products show potential for use in medicine, and the ability to
              replicate their structures in the laboratory opens up the possibility of
              altering them in discrete ways in order to determine how they act in living
              systems.  Several of Professor Wasserman's target molecules fall into the class
              of cyclic peptides, small but intricate molecules which include such familiar
              examples as the vancomycin antibiotics.
