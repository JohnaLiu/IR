The acquisition of a 16 processor SGI/Cray SV1 supercomputer
              with peak performance of 19.2 GFLOPS will allow us to do important theoretical
              geophysics computations that would otherwise not be tractable. We also will
              upgrade and increase the capacity of our RAID 5 network file server to maintain
              our input and output data sets and codes.  We will use the facility to study:
              (1) the behavior of transition metal ions and iron bearing minerals at high
              pressures; (2) diffusion and rheology of perovskite and magnesiowustite; (3)
              high-pressure high-temperature elasticity and anelasticity of perovskite,
              magnesiowustite, iron, and other important Earth phases; and (4) convective and
              subduction transport in the mantle and effects of realistic rheologies on
              mantle convection.  Major outside users currently include Lars Stixrude and his
              group (Univ. Michigan), and S. King (Purdue Univ.). This facility will be
              unparalleled in ability to provide significant blocks of access, especially for
              large memory jobs. This facility is crucially needed for our research, which
              would be crippled without it. The upgrade would also enhance and sustain the
              investment NSF has already made in our Cray system.  Research problems that
              will become possible are: (1) Diffusion, rheology, and finite temperature
              elasticity and anelasticity of orthorhombic silicate perovskite (with NSF
              sponsored post-doc Frederic Marton); (2) Effects of ferrous and ferric iron on
              properties of magnesiowustite and perovskite (with NSF sponsored post-doc
              Stephen Gramsch); (3) High quality molecular dynamics simulations of viscosity
              and melting curve of Fe (with major outside user Prof. L. Stixrude); (4)
              Convection modeling with realistic rheologies obtain via mineral physics (with
              major outside user: Prof. S. King, Purdue University).
