Maintenance of soil fertility is a major challenge to forest
              restoration and sustainable development in the humid tropics, where organic
              matter breaks down quickly, weathering of mineral matter is fast, and high
              rainfall leaches nutrients essential for plant growth. Among the many factors
              that control soil fertility, two are of great importance in both natural and
              managed ecosystems, the number of plant life forms and the frequency with which
              the plant community is harvested or disturbed. Replicated plantations
              comprising three fast-growing tropical tree species established in 1991 at La
              Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica are used to study the controls that
              these two factors exert on soil fertility. In some plantations, the trees are
              grown in monocultures, which are harvested and replanted at three different
              intervals. Other plantations contain the trees plus plants of two other life
              forms, a palm and a banana-like herb. Research for the next five years on this
              LTREB project will address five broad objectives: (1) determine nutrient
              retention, loss, and recovery following stand turnover, (2) attempt soil
              recuperation through nutrient replacement, (3) quantify processes that account
              for changes in soil fertility as a function of changes in community structure,
              (4) track the sequential changes in interspecific interactions and their impact
              on soil fertility, and (5) identify mechanisms involved in temporal changes in
              complementary resources use. The project will provide valuable insight on
              tropical forest ecology and management. In addition, the project will continue
              to train undergraduates and graduate students, and serve as a laboratory for
              courses offered by the Organization of Tropical Studies, local and
              international universities, and informal science visits.
