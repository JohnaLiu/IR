Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

This work will assess the processes that control bioaccumulation of
              persistent organic pollutants (POP's) in phytoplankton. The study will focus on
              polychlorinated-biphenyls (PCB's) which is a common organic pollutant. Lab
              studies would clarify the mechanism of uptake for POPs into phytoplankton
              cells, and incorporate the findings into a previously developed bioaccumulation
              model. The findings will be validated against previously collected field
              data.

This proposal was submitted in response to the Environmental
              Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry solicitation NSF 99-9, and is being funded
              jointly be the Division of Ocean Science, and Molecular and Cellular
              Biosciences.
