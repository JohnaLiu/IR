The Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) Department at
              Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) establishes a Ph.D. cooperative
              education (Co-Op) program with industry.  In addition to completing the
              traditional MSE curriculum, students take courses in the RPI School of
              Management and spend a sizable amount of time in industry, both doing research
              and interacting with industry's business units.

The overall objective of
              this program is to enhance the graduate school experience by offering students
              the opportunity to acquire skills needed by industry without losing the
              academic rigor of a Ph.D. thesis.  Students that graduate from this program may
              have a strong impact on industry in several ways.  They will be prepared to
              start making immediate contributions in their industrial careers.  Also, having
              benefited from a successful academic/industry program, they will be strong
              proponents of similar programs for educating future graduate students.
