Abstract    :
              	The goal of the proposed research is to investigate the temporal evolution of
              the stable isotopic composition of atmospheric nitrous oxide in order to
              elucidate the global budget of this important greenhouse gas.  Time series
              measurements will be made at four sites: La Jolla, CA; Clifton, NC; Trinidad
              Head, CA; and Cape Grim, Tasmania.  Despite the long atmospheric lifetime of
              nitrous oxide (about 125 years), local concentration measurements show up to 3
              percent excursions above baseline concentrations at La Jolla, CA and at
              Clifton, NC.  Simultaneous measurements of other trace gases during periods of
              nitrogen oxide excursion point to an urban contribution at La Jolla and
              agricultural activity at Clifton.  Measurements at these sites will be compared
              to those conducted at the two clear air sites in order to improve the global
              nitrous oxide budget.  Separation and purification techniques have been
              developed for the isolation of pure N2O from air samples suitable for precise
              isotopic analysis by isotope ration mass spectrometry.  Calibration and
              correction procedures have been developed to account for isobaric interferences
              caused by minute amounts of carbon dioxide, which are difficult to completely
              remove.
