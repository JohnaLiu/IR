Abstract    :
              This project investigates differences between group and individual judgment on
              tasks involving ambiguity. Most decisions and judgments must be made on the
              basis of information that is incomplete or less than perfect. These judgment
              situations are often characterized as involving uncertainty or ambiguity. This
              project will examine the various types of ambiguity and how ambiguity affects
              judgment and decision making.  Previous studies have investigated how decisions
              made by individuals have been affected by ambiguity and other individual and
              task factors. However, many important judgments and decisions are made by
              groups. Ambiguity effects previously observed among individuals will be
              examined in a group decision making context, with a focus on directly comparing
              judgments made by groups to those made by individuals. In addition, factors
              likely to moderate ambiguity effects, such as cognitive frame and outcome
              value, will also be investigated to identify possible boundary conditions for
              differences between individuals and groups. The primary goals associated with
              this planning grant are to: (1) integrate theories about ambiguity effects on
              individual judgment with more general models of group judgment and decision
              making; (2) develop tasks and methods to directly compare how individual and
              group judgments are affected by ambiguity; and (3) identify one or more factors
              that influence the degree to which ambiguity differentially affects individual
              and group judgments.
