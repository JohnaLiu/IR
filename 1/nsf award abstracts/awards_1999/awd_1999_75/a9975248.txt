CADRE:  A National
              Facility for High-Performance I/O Characterization and Optimization

This
              award provides support for the establishment of a national facility for I/O
              characterization and optimization tools.  The resulting portable toolkit will
              be able to characterize I/O access patterns on PC workstation clusters,
              scalable parallel systems, and computational grids.  The toolkit is based on
              Pablo, a portable performance environment that supports performance data
              capture and analysis.  The National facility will provide system tools and
              experimental data needed for research in I/O system design, analysis, and
              optimization for scalable parallel and distributed systems.  Web-based
              tutorials, demonstrations and exercises will be developed which, together with
              other outreach activities, will make these tools available and useful to
              smaller institutions.
