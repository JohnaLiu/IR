              Software:  Model-based Management of Adaptive Programs on the Computational
              Grid

Model-based control is the application of end-to-end system modeling to
              control of computational processes and systems.  Curent approaches to control
              of computational processes are based on simple models of the application
              executing on a host environment.  The POEMS model-based control process wil
              extend system control via data analaysis and case-based reasoning.  The POEMS
              approach to model-based control bases analyses, decisions and control on an
              end-to-end model of the total system, including the application, its execution
              environment and alternative system configurations..The model is used to predict
              the behavior of the application in alternative system configurations.
