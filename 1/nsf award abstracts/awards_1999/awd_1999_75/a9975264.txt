Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a study of a large cluster of lakes of
              glacial origin occurs north of Aktash (50 20' N, 87 35' E) in the Altai
              Mountains of southwestern Siberia. They are located in large unforested areas
              at elevations of about 2000 m with conifer forest extending on adjacent ridges
              up to tree line above 2200 m. The lake sediments will be cored to determine by
              pollen analysis the vegetational and climatic history of this little known
              area. Included in the study will be cores from two other lakes in the mountains
              and one in the plain near Tomsk, obtained during exploratory field work in
              1998. The focus in both the mountains and the plain is on the history of the
              steppe/forest border, an ecotone of proven sensitivity to climatic change as
              revealed by pollen analysis. In a second area northeast of the Altai Mountains
              in the steppe region of Khakassia (55 N, 90 E), at elevations about 200 m in a
              basin of the Yenesei River, the bordering ridges contain forest steppe
              characterized by birch and larch, with taiga conifers at elevations above about
              750 m in the adjacent mountains. Fluctuations of these major ecotones will he
              determined by stratigraphic pollen analysis of lake sediments. Lake waters in
              the steppe range from fresh to saline, and their salinity history as determined
              by diatom analysis of their sediments will supplement pollen analysis for the
              reconstruction of the climatic history, for diatoms can sensitively record
              changes in salinity over time, as has been shown especially by extensive
              studies in the North American Great Plains.
