Abstract    :
              Lawrence Bartell of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, is supported by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for studies that aim to achieve a
              better understanding of the collective behavior of molecules during phase
              changes in supercooled condensed matter.   A new experimental approach will be
              combined with computer simulations to investigate nucleation mechanisms.  Very
              large, highly supercooled molecular clusters will be probed by electron
              diffraction to study the kinetics of homogeneous nucleation by monitoring the
              time evolution of phase transitions.  Experimental projects include
              investigating the freezing of water under conditions corresponding to those in
              cirrus clouds and the study of refractory materials.    Simulations of large
              clusters will follow the spontaneous rearrangements of molecules during
              transitions and analyze in molecular detail the formation of critical nuclei
              from which the new phase evolves.  Particular attention will be given to the
              translational and orientational ordering of molecules within the nuclei and in
              the diffuse interface between the nuclei and the old phase.  Attainment of this
              understanding is critical for the development of a realistic theory of
              nucleation.  The experiments on nucleation rates are expected to provide
              benchmarks to be reproduced by theory, as well as information useful to
              atmospheric science.  The simulations are expected to test theories of kinetic
              prefactors and free energy barriers to nucleation. 

Homogeneous nucleation
              is the process that initiates the transformation of a pure, supercooled
              condensed system from one phase to another.  This project will include the
              study of nanoparticles, which constitute a state of matter of a significant
              interest in the materials sciences because of their special, potentially
              valuable properties.  The nucleation of water ice that will be examined is an
              important phenomenon in processes taking place in cirrus clouds that exert a
              strong influence on climate.
