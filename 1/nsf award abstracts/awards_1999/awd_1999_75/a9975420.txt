Abstract    :
              
This award provides funding, primarily in support of young scientists, for the
              International Symposium on Cluster and Nanostructure Interfaces to be held in
              Richmond, VA, on October 25-28, 1999.  The symposium brings researchers from
              diverse communities such as physics, chemistry, biology, materials science and
              engineering together to discuss issues in this highly interdisciplinary field. 
              The meeting focuses on interfaces which are important in such phenomena as
              catalysis and stabilization of nanostructures.  The interface of clusters and
              nanostructures with biological systems will also be discussed.

Funds for
              this symposium are provided by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences Office of Multidisciplianry Activities, the Division of Chemistry, the
              Division of Physics, the Division of Materials Research and the Chemical and
              Thermal Systems Division in the Engineering Directorate.
