As the gap between processor speed and memory latency
              continues to increase, memory accesses have become the key performance
              bottleneck in many application programs.  This project develops new compiler
              techniques to enhance memory performance by improving the utilization of the
              memory hierarchy.  The research targets both uniprocessor workstations and
              parallel computers.  New program transformations are devised to maximize the
              reuse of data which are stored in the fast memory units, such as caches, in the
              memory hierarchy.  These new transformations handle difficult program
              constructs which are commonly found in practice but could not be handled
              previously.  To support the new transformations, an interprocedural analysis is
              developed to analyze the memory access behavior throughout the program.  The
              proposed program analysis and transformations are implemented within a research
              compiler.  Successful development of the are techniques can lead to a
              significant improvement of the execution speed of a wide range of
              applications.
