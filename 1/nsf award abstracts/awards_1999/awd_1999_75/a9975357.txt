Abstract    :
              This research project explores various aspects of polyactide synthesis.  In
              particular, an array of new yttrium and lanthanide complexes are to be prepared
              and characterized.  These complexes will incorporate macrocyclic ligands with
              tunable structural elements, and their utility as polymerization catalysts will
              be investigated with particular attention being paid to gaining an
              understanding of ligan structural influences on the polymerization mechanisms. 
              Building from this, new stereoselective catalysts will be sought, and
              copolymerization of lactides will be studied.  It is anticipated that this work
              will underpin efforts to develop catalytic systems that exhibit controlled
              polymerization kinetics and selectivities in copolymerization.

With this
              Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research
              of Professors William B. Tolman and Marc A. Hillmyer of the University of
              Minnesota.  Professor Tolman and Hillmyer are investigating ways to prepare an
              environmentally "friendly" plastic known as polyactide.  Of particular interest
              are metal catalysts that bring about the formation of the plastic.  Through the
              combined studies of the metal complexes together with their effect on the
              polymerization reaction, improved or new types of plastics as well as new ways
              to form them may be realized.
