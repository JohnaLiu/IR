This award will provide partial support for the acquisition
              of an X-Ray Photo Electron Spectroscopy System.  The equipment will be used for
              research on the phase transformations that occur upon electrochemical cycling
              of LI into and out of intercalation oxides in lithium battery cathode
              materials; for the study of side-chain liquid crystal block copolymers, which
              have important potential application in thin film devices; for characterizing
              pulsed plasma and pyrolytic CVD organic thin films, which have a diverse array
              of applications.  It will also be available for use to all academic users at
              MIT and elsewhere as part of the Analytical Shared Experimental Facility of the
              Center for Materials Science and Engineering (CMSE), and, under the appropriate
              guidelines, to other commercial research organizations.  Graduate students will
              be trained to operate the instrument themselves in the course of their
              research.

The instrument will also be used in the teaching of an
              undergraduate course in materials characterization.
%%%
The equipment will be
              used for research and training of students and training of graduate and
              undergraduate students.
