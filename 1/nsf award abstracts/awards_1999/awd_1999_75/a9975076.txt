Abstract    :
              With this new award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. Watson J. Lees in the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse
              University.   The objective of the research is to understand and develop
              catalyst systems, consisting of mixtures of small thiols and disulfides, which
              are capable of refolding proteins with the formation of new disulfide (S-S)
              linkages, in a manner analogous to the natural enzyme Protein Disulfide
              Isomerase (PDI).   The refolding process has important practical implications,
              since the market for therapeutic proteins manufactured this way is over $600
              million per year.   Examples of proteins made this way include bovine growth
              harmone, tissue plasminogen activator, interleukin-2, and insulin.

The
              strategy is to use mixtures of aromatic disulfides and thiols as redox buffers.
                The thiols have low pKas and are more nucleophilic than aliphatic thiols of
              similar acidity.   Two aromatic thiols will be connected by a linker of varying
              length, permitting them to be oxidized to a disulfide with a  high reduction
              potential, similar to that observed in PDI.   Polyethylene glycol or bovine
              serum albumin will then be attached to provide protein binding capability to
              the artificial enzyme so formed.   Variables to be explored will include both
              the linker length and the effects of substituents on the aromatic rings.
