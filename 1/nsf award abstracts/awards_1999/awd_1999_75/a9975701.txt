This award will provide partial support for the acquisition
              of instruments needed for in-situ investigations of alloy formation in mixed
              anion InGaAsN films and heterostructures towards the development of novel
              materials with tunable photonic properties. The instruments (Reactive Nitrogen
              Source, Cryogenic Pump, and MBE-STM Transfer System) will be combined with the
              existing ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope and Varian Gen II
              molecular beam epitaxial growth chamber, in order to facilitate device-quality
              growth and in-situ characterization of mixed anion nitride-arsenide
              alloys.

The acquisition of this equipment will provide state-of-the-art
              instrumentation for approximately 9 graduate and undergraduate students, at the
              University of Michigan and at Eastern Michigan University, a nearby non-Ph.D.
              granting University. Furthermore, the system will impact additional 30-40
              undergraduate students by enabling growth of technologically important
              nitride-based materials for use in undergraduate laboratory modules in
              electronic and photonic materials.  The system will also provide opportunities
              for growth and characterization demonstrations in undergraduate and graduate
              courses.

This award is expected to significantly enhance research and
              educational activities of faculty and students at several institutions.
