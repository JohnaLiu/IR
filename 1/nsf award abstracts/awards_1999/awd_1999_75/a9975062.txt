This award supports dissertation enhancement
              research by Todd Oakley on understanding the evolutionary history of compound
              eyes in a diverse group of primitive crustacea.  The research merges
              phylogenetic analysis with sensory ecology, and addresses an interesting
              question in arthropod evolution, the "enigma of invertebrate sight".  The
              research will be conducted in collaboration with experts J. Lowery and A.
              Parker at the Australian Museum.

The intent of the proposed research is to
              test whether the compound eyes of ostracods evolved independently of other
              anthropod eyes, by using the history of eye structural genes, photosensitive
              opsims, and phylogenetic mapping.  Two main directions of research will be
              accomplished in this project: molecular and morphological studies.  Australia
              is home to some of the most notable expertise in ostracod morphologies, and
              collaboration with experts there will be a valuable enhancement to the
              dissertation research.  It is also expected that the international experience
              will enhance the student's education and permit new international
              collaboration.
