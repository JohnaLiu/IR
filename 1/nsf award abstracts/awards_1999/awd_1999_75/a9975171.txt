Abstract: This proposal concerns
              several problems in the smooth topology of four
dimensional manifolds.  One is
              to find a topological definition of the
Seiberg-Witten invariants, perhaps by
              exploiting almost complex
structures on 4-manifolds which are "tight" in some
              sense other than
being symplectic.  Second is to find a natural construction
              of a
4-manifold which has as boundary the connected sum of three copies
(with
              alternating orientations) of a given closed 3-manifold.  Third
is (with Paul
              Melvin) to finish work on the handlebody structure of
certain complex elliptic
              surfaces.

Manifolds of dimension four are the least understood of
              all
dimensions, yet they occur frequently, for example, in relation to
              the
three spatial and one temporal dimensions of physical space-time. 
              A
fundamental problem is to classify these manifolds, where classify
means to
              understand them in terms of relatively simple invariants
which can be
              computed.  The Seiberg-Witten invariants which were
discovered in 1994 by
              mathematical physicists are the best current set
of invariants, and much work
              needs to be done in understanding and
extending them.  One technique is
              handlebody theory which involves a
simple way of describing a manifold in
              terms of simple building
blocks.
