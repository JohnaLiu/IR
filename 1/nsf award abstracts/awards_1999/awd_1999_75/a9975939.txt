Abstract    :
              In this project, which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. Joseph O'Connor of the University of
              California - San Diego will pursue an investigation of the synthesis,
              structural elucidation, and mechanistic aspects of the formation and reactions
              of metallacyclobutene complexes. Even though these species play important roles
              in a number of metal-mediated transformations, there are relatively few well
              characterized examples. Thus, new synthetic routes will be devised for
              late-transition metallacyclobutene complexes. These compounds will be used for
              structural studies, well defined reactivity studies, the development of new
              reactions, and the modeling of key steps in reactions that are thought to
              involve metallacyclobutene intermediates. In addition to uncovering new
              synthetic approaches to and applications of these complexes, the proposed
              studies will address stereocontrol of their synthesis and reactions.

This
              project involves investigations of the preparation and reactivity of a class of
              organometallic compound known as metallacyclobutenes. The examples of interest
              for these studies contain late transition elements. The major objective is the
              development of new synthetic methods that may be used in total synthesis of
              natural products and their homologs. As such, the new methods will be valuable
              to the preparation of pharmaceuticals.
