Over the first 4-5 decades of its existence, the field of
              control engineering dealt primarily with mechanical systems which, whether
              rigid or flexible in character, were multi-solid--body systems (where phenomena
              due to fluids can be regarded as lumped-parameter effects). The emergence of
              new actuation and sensing concepts and technologies for fluid flow systems is
              creating an opportunity for control engineering to make a major impact on a
              number of flow-related applications, including delay of transition and
              separation, turbulent drag reduction, mixing enhancement, jet control, noise
              reduction, chemical reactions, combustion instabilities, plasma and fusion
              physics, etc. The rate of progress and investment into actuator/sensor
              technology and the development of experimental capabilities has created an
              unprecedented situation that the theory is lagging behind technology. The
              objective of this workshop is to provide a major thrust towards channeling the
              theoretical and computational talent in the field of flow control towards
              problems that are relevant and on a faster track to transition into products.
              The workshop is not intended to be a broad overview but instead focus on basic
              research issues in control theory, computation, and control-oriented modeling.
              The problems of control of fluid flows are likely to drive the cutting-edge
              development in control theory and related fields for decades to come.

The
              workshop will be organized in conjuction with the 1999 American Control
              Conference in San Diego. It is likely that the workshop will attract a
              significant number of conference attendees. A deliverable of the workshop will
              be proceedings with abstracts of all the talks.
