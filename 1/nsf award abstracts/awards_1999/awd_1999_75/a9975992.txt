Abstract    :
              This high performance connections award provides support for three research
              
institutions in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area to establish a very
              
high performance connection to the gigapop at the University of Washington.
              
The involved institutions are Oregon Graduate Institute, Oregon Health
              
Sciences University, and Portland State University. Their formation of a
              
metropolitan area network, initially designed to support their combined
              
research interests, holds promise for eventual impact of advanced
              
networking on health and other public services, education, and
              
community-based access within a metropolitan setting. Initial research to
              
be supported atop this advanced network link includes the "3-D Visible
              
Embryonic Heart Project", "The Qasar Project for Predictable, Adaptive
              
Multimedia Delivery", and "The CORIE Project" (a prototype system for the
              
Columbia River that deals with meteorological and other related
              
environmental issues).
