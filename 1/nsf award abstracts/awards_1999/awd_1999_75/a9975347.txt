Abstract    :
              How do we decide what choices to make, what options to choose, and what options
              to forsake?  Although decisions can certainly be the result to careful thought,
              the present research examines the role of affect (or feelings) in helping us to
              navigate through the complex and uncertain choices of our world.  Previous
              research has focused on the devlopment of affect among simple choices that
              yield either good or bad outcomes (but not both good and bad).  In real life,
              however, we rarely encounter situations or objects that are completely
              rewarding or altogether punishing.  In this series of projects we will focus on
              how affective feelings might develop and influence choices among options that
              are complex mitures of gains and losses.  Three important questions will be
              addressed in the proposed research:  (1) When we have both good and bad
              experiences with options, how does learning from these experiences influences
              our feelings and our choices?; (2) Can our feelings about an option be changed
              and influence our choices without any change to the objective facts we "know"
              about that option?; and (3) Is careful thought necessary for feelings to guide
              the choices we make?
