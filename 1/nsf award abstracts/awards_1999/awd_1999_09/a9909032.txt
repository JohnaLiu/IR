Abstract    :
              PRAIRIE VIEW A&M UNIVERSITY

The National Science Foundation (NSF)-Prairie
              View A&M University (PVAW) Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology
              (SMET) Enhancement Program has the goal of increasing significantly the number
              of students enrolling and successfully completing an undergraduate degree
              within the SMET related disciplines. The primary objectives of the program are
              to: (1) Develop and maintain successful recruitment and retention programs for
              underrepresented groups within the SMET disciplines, (2) Increase partnerships
              with high schools, academic institutions, corporations and
              industrial/government laboratories, (3) Strengthen the current PVAMU SMET
              education and research infrastructure, (4) Ensure students are informed and
              prepared to transition from high school, through the undergraduate curricula,
              to graduate schools and industry, and (5) Complement the HRD Comprehensive
              Partnership for Mathematics and Science Achievement (CPMSA) at the Beaumont
              Independent School District. The methods to be employed involve establishing
              processes, with evaluation criteria and responsible persons, to ensure success
              of the overall program. The processes will support three major components -
              recruitment and retention, student development and support, and exodus to
              graduate schools and the SMET workforce. The processes will institute the
              following activities: (1) Collaboration and synchronization of university
              recruitment activities, (2) Establishing and maintaining tutorials and
              mentoring sessions, (3) Integrating and facilitating student learning
              enrichment opportunities within the university research and corporate
              partnership programs, (4) Enhancing faculty skills in teaching, research and
              service, (5) Establishing and utilizing advisory boards from the SMET
              community, and (6) Conduct program reviews to assess the progress and success
              of program objectives. Overall, the program will greatly enhance the university
              human and resource development infrastructure within the SMET disciplines in
              the following capacities: (1) Building partnerships and synergism between high
              schools, universities and the SMET workforce, (2) Establishing an
              infrastructure with the greatest potential for student enrollment and success,
              (3) Fostering faculty development and curriculum alignment to better serve the
              various SMET communities, and (4) Developing a system of processes and
              evaluation procedures which will continue beyond the proposed life of the
              grant.
