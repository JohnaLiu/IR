Rehabilitation of Impounded Rivers: Effects of Removal of a
              Kennebec River Dam on Food Webs

Evidence of environmental consequences of
              dam removal on rivers is rare, even though dozens of U.S. hydropower dams will
              need to be relicensed or decommissioned in the next three years.  In 1999, the
              Edwards dam on Maine's Kennebec River will be removed, restoring 24 km of the
              river to a free-flowing state for the first time since 1837. Dr. Thorp and
              colleagues, including several undergraduate students, will sample fish, benthic
              and planktonic invertebrates, aquatic plants, and algae at 3 sites in the river
              immediately before dam removal and 11 months after. A variety of analyses will
              help the investigators demonstrate effects of dam removal on ecosystem
              metabolism, the sources of energy supporting the food web, and the complexity
              of the food web. Because the environmental bases for retaining or removing a
              dam are not as well developed as the economic justifications, this study will
              help fill an important knowledge gap in our understanding of river
              ecosystems.
