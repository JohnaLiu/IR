This award provides support for three years of funding to
              study the scar-like features that are well-known from the Siple Coast ice
              stream system in West Antarctica.  The objective of the proposed field work is
              to identify the nature of several as yet unvisited scars, and to further
              characterize previously-identified margin scars that are poorly dated. 
              Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Radarsat image data will
              be used to locate and map the features, and place them in a regional context. 
              The study seeks to describe the recent history of the Siple Coast glaciers and
              investigate the causes of their changes in configuration.  The main
              investigative tools will be low-frequency RES and high-frequency ground
              penetrating radar (GPR) profiles to image internal layers and measure depths to
              buried crevasses or disrupted layering.  This, coupled with accumulation rates
              determined from shallow ice cores, will provide "shutdown" ages for the margin
              features.  The field data will provide input parameters for simple models of
              ice flow for margins and inter-ice stream ridges during active shearing and
              after shutdown.  This modeling will estimate the initial elevation of a scar at
              the time of shut down and the corresponding ice stream elevation at that time.
