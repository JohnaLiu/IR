Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for one year of data analysis of the solar images
              produced by the Flare Genesis Experiment telescope during a long-duration
              balloon flight over Antarctica in early 2000, near the peak of solar activity
              for this solar cycle.  The telescope produced many thousands of images and maps
              of solar magnetic fields with unprecedented resolution.  It is expected that
              the detailed analysis of the data will improve understanding of how energy
              stored in solar magnetic fields is converted to high temperatures and
              velocities associated with solar activity.
