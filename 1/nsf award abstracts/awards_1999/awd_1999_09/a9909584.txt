This grant provides a continuation (Phase II) of partial
              salary support for technical oversight of the UCLA 40Ar/39Ar lab by manager,
              Dr. Marty Grove.  This support follows three years of 'Phase I' (EAR-9627980)
              funding at the same level.  Direct facility support of this kind is justified
              by the explosive growth in the demand for 40Ar/39Ar analyses over the last
              decade, reflecting both the maturity of the dating technique and the
              recognition of its unique contribution in the realms of thermochronology and
              volcanic stratigraphy.  This 40Ar/39Ar  laboratory has played a significant
              role in this growth by encouraging a broad spectrum of geologists to
              participate directly in analysis programs of their samples and by training many
              of the scientists that have commissioned these new laboratories.  Since 1991,
              the lab was utilized by 84 scientists from 51 different institutions resulting
              in the production of over 70 papers and significantly contributing to 16
              graduate dissertations.  These interactions with visiting scientists both added
              to a growing data base from which to anticipate the response of mineral systems
              in differing geological environments and encourage the transmission of ideas
              during this period when interpretive models are rapidly evolving.  Under Phase
              I funding, Dr. Grove developed an automated extraction system which is fully
              integrated with the mass spectrometry.  Continued funding of this position will
              allow this group to remain at their most productive in tectonic studies of
              orogenesis and landform evolution and will continue to benefit a broader
              community through training of visiting scientists with state-of-the-art
              techniques in 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology.
